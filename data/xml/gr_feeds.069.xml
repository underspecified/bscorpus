In retrospect, one might have added evolutionary geneticist Francisco Ayala as a contender, but that’s the wisdom of hindsight.  Ayala, at least, is not nearly as woo-laden as Collins.  And although he used to be Dominican priest, I’m not at all sure if he still believes in God, a deistic God, or a theistic God (I haven’t followed his talks or read his book &lt;em&gt;Darwin’s Gift to Science and Religion&lt;/em&gt;, which Russell Blackford reviews &lt;a href="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/reviews/2340/darwins-gift-science-and-religion"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). And, in contrast to Collins, he doesn’t go around mixing faith with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, he’s done a lot to promote straight, unsullied evolutionary biology and to battle creationism and its country cousin intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he got the prize not for science but for accommodationism.  Despite my respect for Ayala’s scientific accomplishments and his public defense of evolution, I nevertheless oppose his assertion that religion is “a way of knowing” that is complementary to science.  (Ayala helped write the NAS’s statement to that effect).  Here’s part of his statement for the Templeton Prize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement prepared for the news conference, Ayala forcefully denied that science contradicts religion. “If they are properly understood,” he said, “they cannot be in contradiction because science and religion concern different matters, and each is essential to human understanding.” Referring to Picasso’s &lt;em&gt;Guernica&lt;/em&gt;, he noted that while science can assess the painting’s massive dimensions and pigments, only a spiritual view imparts the horror of the subject matter. Together, he explained, these two separate analyses reveal the totality of the masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respectfully disagree, for this statement assumes that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a “proper” way to understand religion.  As I have written incessantly on this website, a huge number of believers—probably at least half of the Christians in America—don’t understand their religion in this way.  Is Ayala then going to tell these folks that their faith is “improper,” and they simply have to modify it so that it comports with science?  That advice would offend them &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more than any amount of shrill and militant diatribes from new atheists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, what Ayala means by a “proper”  religion is one that &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; contradict science, presumably because it makes no empirical claims about the world.  That makes his NOMA-like harmony a semantic rather than an empirical or philosophical issue. How many Christians, for instance, have a “proper” Christianity that denies the virgin birth, the Resurrection, the efficacy of prayer, or any other way that a theistic deity could affect the world? Certainly not Kenneth Miller or Francis Collins! They are theists, and that’s a form of religion that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; contradict science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;Guernica&lt;/em&gt;, a painting that I love, well, you don’t need religion to be moved by it.  You don’t even need “spirituality,” whatever that means.  All you need is the purely human emotion of being sickened by the horrors of war and their effects on innocent people.  Both atheists and the faithful can fully appreciate the “totality” of this painting, and I don’t see that being religious helps you appreciate it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If religion is “essential to human understanding,” then what, exactly, does it help us understand? And would Ayala diagnose his fellow Europeans, who are largely atheistic, as lacking some important component of human understanding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  As Paul points out in the comments below (gleaned from CalGeorge at Pharyngula), &lt;a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-christian-mans-evolution&amp;amp;page=2"&gt;Ayala was formerly on the Board of Advisors of the John Templeton Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  This means that he joins the large-ish group of members of that Board who won the Templeton Prize &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; their service as advisors. I believe that these include at least six of the last thirteen winners, but I may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE DEUX:  According to the online (UK) &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, Ayala hasn’t lost any time &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/politics/article7076580.ece"&gt;attacking Dawkins for espousing “scientific fundamentalism.&lt;/a&gt;” Ayala says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The scientific fundamentalism proposed by Dawkins implies a materialistic view of the world. But once science has had its say, there remains much about reality that is of interest. Common sense tells us that science can’t tell us everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, but what can &lt;em&gt;religion&lt;/em&gt; tell us about reality? Please, somebody, just give me &lt;em&gt;one thing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The latest is from David J. Tenenbaum of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, founding feature writer for the WhyFiles, who is reviewing in the journal Science Communication. Tenenbaum begins with a revealing vignette:
I e-mailed an eminent limnologist today, seeking to discuss an environmental issue that he’s considered important enough to study for several years. To my delight, he immediately responded with word that a new study was forthcoming in an important journal. Then, to my dismay, he added that the journal’s embargo would expire a couple of weeks after my publication date.
No problem, I replied. He’d watched the issue develop for years and would surely have a useful comment. Then I got the silent treatment.
Huh? When you contact scientists for a living (I admit, science journalism can seem a branch of telemarketing), you get used to nonresponses, to experts who think a “tight deadline” means 3 months, or are in Mongolia or at an invitation-only conference in Estonia. This latest wrinkle on the rejection letter told me that this expert would be happy to get help publicizing his newest research ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/468/60#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F03%2F25%2Fnew-review-of-unscientific-america-in-science-communication%2F" width="100%" height="60" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269538109664"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-9001906645639257892">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53e528dd61b6a36e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="vegetarianism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="cooking" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">It's a myth that all atheists worship seitan</title><published>2010-03-25T16:32:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T16:32:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2010/03/its-myth-that-all-atheists-worship.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">Only vegetarian atheists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last night my wife made a stir-fry using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seitan"&gt;seitan&lt;/a&gt; strips, the first time I had tried it.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Female Brain's cover was straightforward. Thus the original US edition showed the Female Brain as a tangled curly phone cord (facing left):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FemaleBrainCover.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Does anybody under the age of 35 or so actually recognize what that is anymore, by the way?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK edition depicted a woman's brain as an overstuffed purse (facing right):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ldc.upenn.edu/myl/llog/FemaleBrain2.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I can't make sense of the cover of the U.S. edition of &lt;em&gt;The Male Brain&lt;/em&gt; (except that whatever the cover's brain made of, it's facing left again):&lt;/p&gt;

Makes the case for dyslexia is &amp;quot;a gift&amp;quot; and that all dyslexics have unique and superior visual gifts. This is the view of Tom West,

Astrologers certainly want to &lt;a href="http://www.rudolfhsmit.nl/hpage.htm"&gt;pretend&lt;/a&gt; that they are &lt;a href="http://www.astrologycom.com/astrol1.html"&gt;scientific&lt;/a&gt;, so it's exactly the kind of thing many of them would love to do; their only problem is that real scientists would laugh them away, and they certainly wouldn't get the support of any of the major scientific institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is the National Academy of Sciences  supporting an organization claiming to reconcile science and superstition, and why is the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/guardian-article-on-national-academy-and-templeton/"&gt;president of the NAS nominating scientists for such an award&lt;/a&gt;? It's exactly analogous; religion has no more validity than astrology, is openly unscientific, and I would argue is anti-scientific, so no legitimate scientific institution ought to be endorsing it. I know that some of their members may be church-goers, but some of them will also be following their horoscope in the newspapers, so that's still no reason to pander to folly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's something else that's odd: we've got the Templeton Foundation desperately looking for respect by marrying ancient superstitions to modern science, but we've got nothing on the other side.  You don't see &lt;a href="http://www.atheists.org/"&gt;American Atheists&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/"&gt;American Humanist Association&lt;/a&gt; funding research that would promote the idea that godlessness and science are compatible; they don't have as much money, for one thing, but also we take it for granted that &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; invoking supernatural forces is a pretty reasonable thing to do in science. The godless don't have to strain to wedge their ideas into a domain that excludes them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also don't have an organization awarding a prize to the scientist who "has made an exceptional contribution to affirming life's [&lt;b&gt;natural, material&lt;/b&gt;] dimension, whether through insight, discovery, or practical works" (that's the description of the Templeton Prize, with one little change). It would be redundant, since that's what science does. We also don't have a major atheist organization giving out awards specifically to the scientist of the year who has made the greatest contribution to actively promoting secularism, even though they could: Dawkins, Harris, Kroto, Atkins and many others would be on the shortlist, easily. Maybe they should, but most atheists aren't so insecure that they need to make a special effort to show that their ideas are compatible with science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason they should, though, is just to see what would happen when they asked a major scientific institution to host the award ceremony. I predict a very rapid back-pedal from an organization that wouldn&amp;#39;t want to get into a political tangle…a consideration they apparently don&amp;#39;t worry about when what is being promoted is religion, despite the fact that religion is a fraud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/how_much_support_is_the_nas_wi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/LxKHNlvo7Yw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269533993142"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22768">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f689bd8846a1119</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Catholic Church Penalizes Charity for Homeless because Leader Supports Gay Marriage</title><published>2010-03-25T16:00:41Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T16:00:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/25/catholic-church-penalizes-charity-for-homeless-because-leader-supports-gay-marriage/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When someone tells you that, despite some of the recent problems in the Catholic Church, the Church is still a force for good, &lt;a href="http://www.pressherald.com/news/diocese-penalizes-homeless-aid-group_2010-03-23.html"&gt;show them this article&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s evidence of how their hatred of gay people, cloaked in “loving” religious beliefs, has caused them to take money away from a charity for the homeless… because a bishop working with the group supported gay marriage in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Preble Street’s Homeless Voices for Justice program has lost $17,400 this year and will lose $33,000 that it expected for its next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeless Voices for Justice, a statewide advocacy group, is led by people who have been homeless. It works on issues that affect the homeless, such as supporting affordable housing and preventing violence against the homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland-based Preble Street, which runs a dozen programs to provide housing and other services for the poor and the homeless, provides staff support for Homeless Voices for Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Catholic Charities Maine, which is led by [Bishop Richard] Malone, sent a letter to Preble Street asking it to return $2,400 that the diocese had granted for the Homeless Voices for Justice program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We regret the collaboration must end at this time,” wrote Sandra Thompson of Catholic Charities Maine, who coordinated the distribution of the church’s local anti-poverty funds. “Accountability to the Catholic community requires this.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt;, they care about accountability? That’s laughable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland is willing to de-fund a charity for the hungry and homeless because a key member believes in equal rights for gay people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought the Church couldn’t get any more despicable.&lt;/p&gt;

In the classic musical The Fiddler on the Roof the main character, Tevye, muses on this basic fact of human existence:

Here in Anatevka we have traditions for everything... how to eat, how to sleep, even, how to wear clothes. For instance, we always keep our heads covered and always wear a little prayer shawl... This shows our constant devotion to God. You may ask, how did this tradition start? I'll tell you - I don't know.

The origin of particular cultural traits in human populations has long been a mystery to anthropologists.  Many societies have responded the same way Tevye did, "it's merely part of our culture, what else do you need to know?"  Nevertheless, the maintenance and dissemination of cultural traits remains a fascinating topic that scientists have long struggled to understand.  More recently, however, researchers have discovered that humans aren't unique in this regard.  Nonhuman primates also have culture and research into how this is transmitted between individuals has recently taken a major step forward.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've sworn off agnosticism, which I now call cowardly atheism. I've come to the position that in the complete absence of any supporting data whatsover for the persistence of the individual in some spiritual form, it is necessary to operate under the provisional conclusion that there is no afterlife and then be ready to amend that if I find out otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Greek government has announced it will start taxing churches as part of its efforts to get out of its financial crisis. A new draft bill to be tabled in parliament next week imposes a 20 per cent tax on the Orthodox church's real estate income, reportedly worth over 10 million Euros (US $14.8 million) a year, the Wall Street Journal reports.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Greek Orthodox church is squealing like a stuck pig, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the Greek government has a debt of €216 &lt;b&gt;billion&lt;/b&gt;; belatedly taxing €10 &lt;b&gt;million&lt;/b&gt; isn't going to make much of a dent.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://neflorida.unitedcor.org/"&gt;Northeast Florida&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/images/Billboard_NortheastFloridaCoR_hi-res.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://unitedcor.org/images/Billboard_NortheastFloridaCoR_hi-res.jpg" title="NEFlorida" width="550" height="183"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sign &lt;a href="http://neflorida.unitedcor.org/node/39"&gt;can now be seen&lt;/a&gt; in Jacksonville and St. Augustine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Reaching out to the like minded isn’t the only goal of the effort. “We also want to let the general public know that those of us who don’t believe in a higher power live in the area, too,” added &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Peek&lt;/strong&gt;, coordinator of Northeast Florida CoR. “Folks may not know that people like us can be found everywhere. We’re family members, friends, neighbors and coworkers. So we think it’s time that we became open about our views, just as others are open about theirs.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local &lt;a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-03-24/story/billboard-campaign-announce-atheists%E2%80%99-first-coast-presence"&gt;religious leaders are troubled&lt;/a&gt; by the presence of the billboards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It does concern me,” said the Rev. Armand Egnew, pastor of Crosswalk Community Church, an Assemblies of God congregation in Fleming Island. “It throws confusion out to people… who are not solidly grounded” in their faith.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good.  Let them be confused, and let them see the light we have to offer, and let them walk away from the church.  They’ll be better off because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’m internally debating whether or not I want to see the billboards get vandalized.  I hope they don’t, because it’s just a sad reflection on our society… but it’ll only mean more press coverage, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s where my mind is every time I see a new billboard now.  I think there’s something wrong with me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

For Democrats nervous about political fallout from the bill in the November midterm elections, it’s reassuring to imagine that the myths about the legislation — that it provides free coverage to illegal immigrants, uses taxpayer money to subsidize abortions and mandates end-of-life counseling for the elderly — will be dispelled by its passage.
But public knowledge of the plan’s contents may not improve as quickly as Democrats hope. While some of the more outlandish rumors may dissipate, it is likely that misperceptions will linger for years, hindering substantive debate over the merits of the country’s new health care system. The reasons are rooted in human psychology.

Nyhan goes on to talk about how we ideologically filter information to support our political presuppositions--e.g., conservatives will hold on to lies about "death panels" long after the bill's passage.

It's a great piece, but it is missing, I think, an important angle. I believe the Internet makes this problem of misinformation and ideological filtering a lot, a lot worse. I wonder what Nyhan would say to that.

But &lt;a href="http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/staff/profile/?go=10947"&gt;Vaughan Bell&lt;/a&gt; at Mind Hacks has an evaluation ("&lt;a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2010/03/brizendine_true_to_.html"&gt;Brizendine, true to stereotype&lt;/a&gt;", 3/24/2010) based on an Opinion piece by Brizendine on CNN 's web site ("&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/23/brizendine.male.brain/index.html"&gt;Love, sex, and the male brain&lt;/a&gt;", 3/24/2010).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by that Op-Ed, Dr. Brizendine's new book is cut from the same cloth as her earlier one, &lt;em&gt;The Female Brain&lt;/em&gt;. (See &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003998.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Alanguagelog.ldc.upenn.edu%2Fnll+Brizendine&amp;amp;aq=o&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog+Brizendine&amp;amp;aq=o&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for links to previous LL discussion.) Vaughan quotes this passage from the CNN piece&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Our brains are mostly alike. We are the same species, after all. But the  differences can sometimes make it seem like we are worlds apart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The &amp;quot;defend your turf&amp;quot; area — dorsal premammillary nucleus — is larger in the male brain and contains special circuits to detect territorial challenges by other males. And his amygdala, the alarm system for threats, fear and danger is also larger in men. These brain differences make men more alert than women to potential turf threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and notes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Male and female humans are indeed the same species, but we are not a species which has a dorsal premammillary nucleus because it's only been &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;amp;orig_db=PubMed&amp;amp;term=%22dorsal%20premammillary%20nucleus%22&amp;amp;cmd=search"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; in the rat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Furthermore, there is no reliable evidence that amygdala size differs between the sexes in humans and a recent &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20227858"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that looked specifically at this issue found no difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference to sex (non-)differences in amygdala size is specific and telling (J. Brabec et al., "Volumetry of the human amygdala - An anatomical study", &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Res&lt;/em&gt; 2010).  Dr. Brizendine is clearly up to her old tricks here, confidently setting out "scientific facts" that are unsupported (or even contradicted) by the scientific literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the issue about the dorsal premammillary nucleus is less clear to me — Vaughan bases his debunking on a PubMed search, which does turn up only references to work in rodents. But maybe Brizendine has found some work that measures this small and obscure piece of the brain in male and female humans — I&amp;#39;ll take a look at the footnote(s) provided for this point in her book. (I don&amp;#39;t expect to find anything relevant, alas, but fair is fair.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, as Vaughan points out,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The rest of the article is full of Brizendine's usual style which is to take a common stereotype of male or female behaviour and than to 'explain' it with a overly-simple, one dimensional and usually not directly tested brain explanation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cites this specific example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;All that testosterone drives the &amp;quot;Man Trance&amp;quot;– that glazed-eye look a man gets when he sees breasts. As a woman who was among the ranks of the early feminists, I wish I could say that men can stop themselves from entering this trance. But the truth is, they can&amp;#39;t. Their visual brain circuits are always on the lookout for fertile mates. Whether or not they intend to pursue a visual enticement, they have to check out the goods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Got that? Testosterone is responsible for men looking at breasts, perhaps even falling into an irresistible tit-driven trance, and we can't help it. Are there any scientific studies on whether hooter staring is related to testosterone levels? (Sadly) No.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, this new book certainly looks like another collection of what I've called &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003847.html"&gt;scientific  bible stories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;As I've watched the reaction to Louann Brizendine's book over the past few months, I've concluded that "scientific studies" like these have taken over the place that bible stories used to occupy. It's only fundamentalists like me who worry about whether they're true. For most people, it's only important that they're morally instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;What would the producers of CNN Headline News, NPR's "Wait, wait, don't tell me" or the BBC's "Have I got news for you" say, if presented with evidence that they've been peddling falsehoods? I imagine that their reaction would be roughly like that of an Episcopalian Sunday-school teacher, confronted with evidence from DNA phylogeny that the animals of the world could not possibly have gone through the genetic bottleneck required by the story of Noah's ark. I mean, lighten up, man, it's just a story.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269526248305"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13124">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ce4620b76993f76a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><category term="dust"/><category term="infrared"/><category term="Milky Way"/><category term="Planck"/><category term="Star Trek Generations"/><title type="html">The Milky Way erupts with cold dust</title><published>2010-03-25T14:00:51Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T14:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/VGvYFdmK6V8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/25/the-milky-way-erupts-with-cold-dust/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about astronomy is that it opens our eyes to things those eyes literally cannot see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been to dark sites countless times and gazed up at the Milky Way; that dim and fuzzy path of light that represents the combined glow of billions of stars, gas clouds, and dust. To my eyes, it’s bright enough to see some details, and it’s lovely… but what we see is a facade, the barest skin draped thinly over depth and grandeur we can hardly perceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, until we look at our galaxy with new eyes: ones tuned to the far, far infrared. Then we see magnificence on a scale so breathtaking we can hardly comprehend it. Behold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/73/P545-P857-I100_1000px.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/planck_milkyway.jpg" alt="planck_milkyway" title="planck_milkyway" width="610" height="544"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is what lurks beneath the dim view our eyes collect! It’s what &lt;a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=46706"&gt;the European Space Agency’s Planck observatory sees&lt;/a&gt; when it looks at the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! This image is a whopping 55 square degrees of sky — &lt;em&gt;280 times&lt;/em&gt; the area of the full Moon on the sky — centered near the constellation of Aquila the Eagle. The resolution of the data is about 5 arcminutes, meaning objects as small as 1/6th the size of the Moon on the sky can be distinguished; that’s very high-res for images in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. And as an astronomer who is pretty familiar with the night sky, I have to say it’s very weird to see an image like this and have almost no idea what’s in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know a lot of what I’m seeing in general, but specific objects are totally impossible to identify. That’s because this image is hugely removed from visible light. It’s a three-color image composed of separate shots in the wavelengths (think of them as colors) of 100, 350, and 540 microns. For comparison, the longest wavelength of light our eyes can see is about 0.7 microns or so; these Planck images are therefore way the heck and gone in the infrared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing is very cold dust, and by very cold I mean &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; cold: much of it is a frigid 12 Celsius above absolute zero. In Fahrenheit, that’s -438°. Yes, &lt;em&gt;four hundred thirty eight degrees below zero&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents dust far away from the warming light of stars, dust that is sitting in deep space, radiating away feebly in the far infrared. Mapping this dust tells us much about it, like how stars make dust and fling it into space, and how the dust behaves when it’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that bright line right down the middle? That’s the dust located in the disk of the Milky Way galaxy itself. Our galaxy is a flat disk 100,000 light years across, but maybe only 1% of that in thickness. We’re located inside that disk, so that when we look in that direction we see it projected as a line across the sky. That’s where most of the gas and stars in the galaxy are located, so that’s where most of the dust is as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m fascinated by the structure of the dust above the galactic plane. There are swoops and swirls, filaments and ribbons. I’m drawn to the long thin line on the right that must be dozens or hundreds of light years long; it appears to end in a swirl of dust. What the heck could be causing that? I’m not sure. There’s so much going on here that it’ll be some time before astronomers can sort it all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/75/P857.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/planck_milkyway_350microns.jpg" alt="planck_milkyway_350microns" title="planck_milkyway_350microns" width="410" height="364"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One thing I want to point out is the one component of that image taken at 350 microns, seen here on the left. This is extremely cold dust, and as a major geek I can’t help wonder if the structure seen here was diverted by Malcolm McDowell to swing past &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Generations"&gt;Veridian III&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for irony, you’ve found it: &lt;a href="http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=33333"&gt;Planck is designed to investigate the Cosmic Microwave Background&lt;/a&gt;, the faint glow leftover from the Big Bang. As far as Planck is concerned, the Milky Way is a foreground object blocking the view! It has to map our local space very carefully so that emission can be removed from the actual target data, and reveal what the far more distant background Universe can tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true in astronomy as well as so many other aspects of life: what’s signal to one is noise to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was surprised and upset to see that the NAS is allowing the Templeton Foundation to announce  the winner of the Templeton Prize in the historic Lecture Hall of the Academy.   It is inappropriate and counter-productive for the NAS, a scientific organization, to interact in this way with an overtly religious group such as the Templeton Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not a faith-based organization – we ask questions and seek the answers in evidence.  In a country plagued by ignorance and superstition, the NAS ought to be a beacon of coherent rational thinking and skeptical inquiry. If science is, as George Ellery Hale stated, our guide to truth, then religion is clearly incompatible with science, as should be apparent from considerations of faith versus inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations that promote faith and religious belief have no place in the NAS, and to see the NAS hosting a Templeton event sends the message to the public that science and religion are completely compatible and indeed that science-religion interactions should be fostered.  I disagree strongly, and I am very disappointed by this action of the NAS.  Indeed, to host such an event encourages a misrepresentation not only of the organization, but of the members.  Just last night Rabbi Wolpe publicly claimed that over half of the elected members of the Academy are theists.  More critically, the Academy is misrepresented by this event. Our mission is to inquire into issues of national import and to do so as scientists.  We have no mandate to accommodate any position of faith whether based in religion or other prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the winner is an NAS member is irrelevant.  A small minority of NAS members may be religious, but  they should promote their personal religious views separately from the NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the least a statement from the NAS is needed at this time, clarifying its independence and, I would hope, declaring the decision to host this event a mistake.  The Academy’s image needs to be mended both for the public and its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack W. Szostak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning’s edition of the &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt; plopped through my letter-box this morning, containing a review of Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini’s &lt;em&gt;What Darwin Got Wrong &lt;/em&gt;by Samir Okasha, Professor of the Philosophy of Science at the University of Bristol. The review isn’t available on-line for the moment, and is extremely long – and thorough and fair. The final paragraph – transcribed by my own fair fingers – will give you a flavour of the thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The upshot of all this is that their critique of neo-Darwinism comes to nothing. The biological discoveries they take to refute the neo-Darwinist theory do not do so; they are easily accommodated by it. The notion of adaptation is in perfectly good shape; the distinction between selection-for and free-riding is just the ordinary distinction between causality and correlation. Evolutionary biology is not ‘logically flawed’, and is not a mere collection of historical narratives, but rather a science that produces genuine causal explanations, and indeed one of the most successful sciences we have. &lt;em&gt;What Darwin Got Wrong&lt;/em&gt; makes for entertaining and engaging reading, but is the sort of thing that gives philosophy of science a bad name.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[EDIT: The full review is now available on-line &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/Subscriber_Archive/Philosophy_Archive/article7075793.ece"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; however, it's subscription only. I've asked the folk at the TLS to make it available to everyone, and they're thinking about it... I'll keep you informed. I also fixed Piattelli's name which was inadvertently misspelled - my apologies. MC]&lt;/p&gt;

He wrote:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;To the editor:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the Bible when Jesus was born, wise men from the East hailed Him as “King of the Jews.” Five days before His crucifixion the multitudes cried out: “Blessed is the King of Israel.” And when Jesus was crucified, above His head on the cross, Pilate placed this accusation: “This is Jesus the King of the Jews.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people attach no literal meaning to that title, especially one that has anything to do with Jews. Jesus was a Jew. He descended from Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Jesus clearly identified himself with the Jews and the nation Israel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Israel appears 2,566 times in the Bible. Jerusalem is named more than 800 times. The expression “God of Israel” appears over 200 times. We should realize by this that “Jerusalem” and “Israel” are subjects very close to the heart of God. It is here where God established His throne, and on that throne the Messiah, Jesus, King of the Jews must reign over Israel and the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing that only Jesus can defeat him, Satan has influenced 3,000 years of anti-Semitism. Destroying all Jews would have prevented Jesus from being born. But Satan failed. He then tried to kill Jesus on the cross, but He rose from the grave. And Satan failed again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if all Jews could be destroyed today, God could not fulfill His promise that Jesus Christ would reign as king of the Jews at his second coming. God would be a liar and Satan the winner. God’s integrity and eternal purposes are linked to Israel’s survival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shameful horror of anti-Semitism throughout history provides a shocking depiction of the human heart. Satan found many only too eager to persecute and even kill God’s chosen people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those who wish to stand against God’s people, let them be aware, they could be doing the devil’s work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In all the ages God has had only one plan, and that plan is that his glory and his salvation should go forth from Israel to all nations. Israel and Jerusalem are truly unique in that they are central in God’s great plan for the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bible makes it clear that the choice of the Jewish people was for God’s own redemptive purposes on earth. God chose Israel to introduce the “Savior” to the world, his only son Jesus Christ, and the “King of the Jews.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ken Blinco &lt;a href="http://www.kpcnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=12028:God%E2%80%99s-eternal-purposes-linked-to-Israel%E2%80%99s-survival.&amp;amp;catid=36:letters-to-the-editor"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here is my response:&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me comment on Ken Blinco’s ignorant use of the Bible to justify a pro Israeli political stance in this modern era of weapons of mass destruction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, if we take the Bible at face value, which Blinco does, then to fulfill God's Palestinian land promise to them their God orders the complete genocide of the Canaanites, their children, and their livestock in a massive land grabbing blood fest. I’m sure Blinco would not be in favor of genocide today, although he thinks nothing of the horror of what such a God supposedly commanded the Hebrews to do in the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, Blinco’s conviction that the land of Palestine and Jerusalem are “central in God’s great plan for the earth” was the same one the church used to justify several bloody Crusades to capture Jerusalem from the infidels in the Middle Ages. Crusades, you know, those murderous wars that most Christians claim they never would have participated in, even though Blinco shares the same conviction they did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third, even though Blinco and most all Christians have learned to be more racially tolerant and anti-Semitic he fails to realize that ever since Jesus was railroaded to his death by Jews most Christians have been anti-Semitic. Even the reformer Martin Luther, the founder of the Lutheran church, wrote in 1543 in his tract, &lt;i&gt;On the Jews and Their Lies&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;“First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no man will ever again see a stone or cinder of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians, and do not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying, cursing, blaspheming of his Son and of his Christians .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasures of silver and gold be taken from them and put aside for safekeeping .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the children of Adam.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Fourth, most all Christians deny the theology that Blinco expresses. Even Paul the Apostle said “there was neither Jew nor Greek” (Galatians 3:28 ). One’s race should not matter, says Paul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blinco’s ignorant pro Israel dispensational political theology among U.S. Congressmen has actually provoked Muslim aggression, and should be abandoned. In its place most voices are calling for a more balanced approach where the US shows humanitarian concern to Israel and at the same time holds Israel accountable for its treatment of the Muslim inhabitants of the land&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2717054281301141731?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I am now going to take his brief and elegant point and beat that horse to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While XKCD applies his equation to UFO sightings, it applies equally well to any paranormal or pseudoscientific phenomenon – bigfoot, ghosts, alternative medicine healings, etc. Often we are told by believers that “where there is smoke there is fire.” In other words – with so many people reporting sightings or healings, there must be something going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics, of course, recognize this as a fallacy. There is a major unstated premise or assumption in this position. We must ask ourselves – in a hypothetical world in which we are not and have never been visited by aliens, what would we expect in terms of sightings and experiences? Is such a world compatible with the current number and quality of sightings? I think the answer to this is a pretty clear “yes” – and that is exactly the point that XKCD is making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a host of psychological, cultural, and situational factors that would lead people to believe they have had a paranormal or extraterrestrial encounter. Most of us have had weird experiences we may or may not have been able to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We add to this the fact that human memory is both flawed and biased toward interesting and meaningful narratives. We tend to morph memories over time simply because they fade with time, and are susceptible to merging with other memories and even contamination. Have you ever “remembered” an event that you never experienced but someone else told you about. You imagined the story, and then years later confused your imaginings with your own first-hand memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we tend to smooth over the rough edges of our memories – distorting details to fit the theme. So if we think that our encounter with a strange light was an encounter with an alien spacecraft, over time the details of the story will fit a UFO encounter better and better. We will drop or alter disconfirming details, and enhance or even confabulate supporting details. Details from other witnesses will also contaminate our memories (and may give the false impression of independent confirmation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we have a story that sounds very compelling, and the person telling the story likely really believes it and the supporting details. Often believers are compelled by the sincerity of those with such tales to tell. First, sincerity can be faked. But even if we assume it is genuine, it is meaningless because people can be sincerely mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XKCD makes the further point that given the number of people in the world we would expect a large number of even unlikely events (mundane but unusual or highly coincidental), and some of this will be further distorted in the telling, and some of these will become widely spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The take home message for skeptics is that even in a world without ghosts, aliens, and bigfeet we would expect there to be large numbers of anecdotes that sound very impressive, told by people who seem sincere. In a world with these things, we should also expect some objective and verifiable evidence – and that is what is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of “where there is smoke there is fire” simply does not apply, because human brains and the cultures in which they are embedded are smoke machines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269519772872"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/recent_archaeomags_2.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b2aaf2c7fc892ea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Recent Archaeomags</title><published>2010-03-25T13:20:08Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T13:20:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/z1-B7N3Mktg/recent_archaeomags_2.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/recent_archaeomags_2.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skalk.dk/"&gt;Skalk&lt;/a&gt;'s&lt;/i&gt; February issue was not up to the Danish pop-arch journal's usual excellent standard. I am always keen to read interesting news from Jelling and Lejre, the country's proto-historic centres. But in this case the editors have devoted 17 of the issue's 30 pages to articles about Harold Bluetooth's Jelling despite the fact that nothing of interest has come up there recently. One reports on humdrum trial excavations and the other on the state of erosion on the hamlet's rune stones. Denmark's archaeology is extremely rich and there's no reason to go on and on about early royal sites just because they were once royal. That only makes Danish archaeology look stupidly nationalistic. To me, the highlights of the issue were instead a piece on the drastic fate of 19th century German war memorials on Danish soil, and another one reporting that execution burials at a river crossing near the Vendel/Viking Period magnate farm of Tissø have been re-dated to the 13th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Populär Arkeologi's&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.popark.nu/110/index1.html"&gt;first issue for 2010&lt;/a&gt; offers thematically mixed fare as usual, much of it about northernmost Sweden. The pieces I like best are a summary of my old grad-school buddy Peter Bratt's PhD thesis on great barrows and my old thesis supervisor Gustaf Trotzig's opinion piece against the suggested new history curriculum for children aged 7-16, where everything before AD 800 is disregarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Archaeological Institute of America's &lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.org/1003/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Archaeology&lt;/i&gt; for March/April&lt;/a&gt; also ranges widely. My interest was mainly caught by a feature piece on the state of research into the Indus script. Is it a script? Or just a kind of heraldry? The inscriptions are extremely few and short, and since no archives of longer texts have been forthcoming, it looks like we may never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magazines like &lt;i&gt;Populär Arkeologi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Archaeology&lt;/i&gt;, not to mention global-scope academic journals like &lt;i&gt;Antiquity&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Europan Journal of Archaeology&lt;/i&gt;, always remind me of how different my perspective on archaeology is from that of the general reader. My curiosity about ancient cultures worldwide certainly isn't limitless. While, for instance, the 12th century Salado pottery of southwestern US and northern Mexico is lovely to look at in the pages of &lt;i&gt;Archaeology&lt;/i&gt;, I can't really be bothered to learn much about that far-off world unless somebody pays me. Fishermen don't go fishing in their spare time.&lt;br&gt;

I'm not really a political blogger. True, I do from time to time succumb to the blogger's temptation of being a pundit on current events or pontificating on politics, but in general I don't do that very often because political bloggers are a dime a dozen and politics isn't my area of strength. Writing about science and science-based medicine is. That's part of the reason why I really haven't said much about the massive health care reform bill that was passed on Sunday or the political process, except when on occasion the utter insanity of it all (such as nonsense about "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/obamas_fixin_death_panels_uspstf_mammography.php"&gt;death panels&lt;/a&gt;" or the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/08/the_latest_obama_hitler_shenanigans_too.php"&gt;Obama = Hitler&lt;/a&gt;" rhetoric) irritates me enough to make me break my usual guideline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's why I won't say that much, even now. Passing judgment on President Obama's health care plan is not what I'm about, particularly because I'm not really sure what the effect will be. I will, however, say that our current health care system is the worst of both worlds. It's not really a free market system, given that the government in essence sets reimbursement rates for evrything for Medicare and that Medicare reimbursement rates are generally the starting point for negotiations between hospitals, doctors, and insurance companies for reimbursement rates. So we have a government-regulated and largely government-paid health care system without the one single benefit that a government health care system should be able to produce: Universal or near-universal coverage. At the same time we have a system that is allegedly capitalistic without the one benefit that free competition should provide: Lower prices. The result is a system that is expensive compared to what it delivers and that leaves a lot of people without health insurance because they can't afford it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add to that the stress of the crappiest economy in the last several decades, and there are a lot of people out there without insurance, and when they get sick all too often they are out of luck. I practice in a cancer center that is located in the inner city in an area with some of the highest unemployment in the country. I see how the safety net has shredded in the form of women with breast cancer who don't have any insurance and aren't sure how they'll manage to get the care they need, even with the best efforts of our financial counselors and social workers. That's why it's hard for me not to be at least a little bit hopeful that this new law will alleviate that situation. Even though the law itself has numerous flaws, it will result in many more people obtaining health insurance, and it's something that can be built upon. More importantly, the law actually codifies the principle that every citizen should have access to decent health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, whatever objections I have, whatever I might find promising about Obamacare, I can understand some of the opposition to it. No, I can't understand it when some opponents have actually threatened violence or made racial slurs against black legislators who voted for the law. I also can't understand why the Republicans shot themselves so gloriously in the foot with an AK-47 by absolutely refusing to go along with (or even negotiate seriously over) a plan that very much resembles the Republican alternative plan proposed as an alternative to President Clinton's health care plan in the early 1990s and appears to have been largely inspired by Mitt Romney's health care plan passed in Massachusetts. I thought Republicans were truly cynical and obstructionist in their universal resistance to this legislation and unwillingness to work with the President. I thought some of their most extreme elements were riduculously over the top criticizing the bill itself. But even the Rush Limbaughs of the world have a hard time matching that master of woo-filled paranoid conspiracy theories, Mike Adams. In the wake of Obamacare being passed by the House of Representatives, Adams penned to amazingly nutty screeds, one entitled &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028416_health_care_reform_legislation.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Health care reform bill dooms America to Pharma-dominated sickness and suffering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/028424_health_care_reform_medicine.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Health care dictatorship: A crime against America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I can say is: Wow.

Intake, not output, is what has got us into this mess.2.  If you are part of the nearly 2/3rds of the population who&amp;#39;s overweight or obese exercise alone is not likely to help you maintain your weight let alone help you to lose it.3.  If you&amp;#39;ve got a healthy weight and don&amp;#39;t want to gain you&amp;#39;ll have to do a ridiculous amount of daily exercise.and most importantly,4.  The more research that gets published failing to show causal benefit to exercise on weight loss the more difficult it&amp;#39;ll be to promote exercise.  What I mean by that statement above is that each and every time studies like this are splashed around the newspapers and blogosphere it diminishes the absolute importance of exercise.  That&amp;#39;s just plain bad because exercise is likely the second most important determinant of health (nutrition being the first).  To me it seems the story on exercise is very clear - it&amp;#39;s absolutely crucial for health, in extreme quantities it&amp;#39;s helpful for maintaining weight, and it&amp;#39;s really, really lousy as an exclusive modality for weight loss. Bottom line?  I would love to see more studies funded to demonstrate the health benefits of exercise and less studies funded that ultimately serve only to dissuade people from bothering to exercise in the first place by having outcomes that are extremely, predictably, disappointing.I-Min Lee, Luc Djoussé, Howard D.

&lt;p&gt;And it’s not because she’s suddenly an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why she doesn’t go to church anymore? Because &lt;strong&gt;her intelligence, deep thinking and independence are not respected&lt;/strong&gt;. I don’t mean her feelings are hurt because people don’t applaud these things about her, but because they are simply not respected. Therefore she is not respected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what she intuits when she walks into the church: hostility to diversity of thought; pressure to conform her beliefs to the norm; the most immature thinking rules the roost; she can spectate but not participate; anxious adherence to eroded ideas and the fear of questioning them; cold hard adherence to expectations; lovelessness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are qualities that most atheists I know strongly value.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To David’s friend: Come to the dark side!  We respect you!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/24/women-not-allowed-to-speak-during-church-vote/"&gt;unlike some churches&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt; her to voice her opinions and challenge us, instead of letting a man speak on her behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

In swapping Facebook messages with him, he sent me the following piece he wrote as a bloggy-type post. It's about a crazy chick he met in a bar, and with his permission, I am putting it up here as a guest post. Please enjoy "The Equation."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had been a long day working out of town. I went back to my hotel intending to crash like Tom Sizemore after a six-day weekend after going down to the bar to check out the final scores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A girl came down and sat near me. I asked her what she was having and told the bartender to put it on my tab. We were having a nice two-minute single-serving conversation until I mentioned I was having a bad week. Then things got all weird.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Whenever I'm having a hard time, I remember I'm Working on The Equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;She reached into her purse and handed me a worn piece of paper. It smelled like lip gloss, gum, cigarettes and cell phone. It simply said "X=Y".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: What Equation are you Working on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: Uh, I'm not working on anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To imagine the sneer she gave me, pretend you just watched me eat a baby whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Oh. You're one of those people. You know, it takes just as much Work to do no equation than it does to do The Equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This chick had totally lost me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: You totally lost me. Why would I need to do work if I have no equation to work on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Well, as you can see on The Paper, I'm Working on X=Y. You're Working on 0=0.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: No I'm not. Zero is still, like, an idea. I don't even have a piece of paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Well, you're just Working on 0=0 in your mind then. Everyone needs an Equation to Work on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: Why are you working on X=Y?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Because without X=Y there would be no Math! It's the Origin of Algebra, the Alpha of Arithmetic!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I knew I was about to crack open a can of Wish I didn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: What makes you think X=Y?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She just didn't understand the concept. Like I had just come out of the bathroom wearing American flag Zoobaz pants and a see-through tank-top asking if I could wear it to the funeral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Can you prove X doesn't Equal Y??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: Why should I? It's your equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Well if you can't prove It doesn't, then It probably does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: Yeah, it could. X could be a base ten number and Y a base eight. Or X could represent it's own set like (3+3) and Y equal 9. But do you have any reason to think it does? X and Y are letters, so I'll take the easy route and say X and Y are different until you give me a reason to think otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: I think you need to open your mind to the fact that The Paper says X=Y and we should Work on The Equation so there can be Math.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: Have you ever thought that even if X didn't equal Y there'd still be math?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: I can't even imagine Math without X=Y.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: OK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait for it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: Maybe X does equal Y but it's not the origin of algebra. They're two separate thoughts, right? First you should show that X=Y. Then you can start working on the next problem: whether there's any reason to think that it's the alpha of arithmetic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time, the very countenance of this person changed. As if she was talking to Kermit the Frog this whole time, then suddenly noticed it was really a guy with his hand up a puppet's butt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHE: Well. Thanks for the drink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Said with the enthusiasm of a DMV employee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ME: No problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good night Toots, you're welcome. Because everyone orders a $21 triple fuzzy sloe greyhound with a slice of cantaloupe and drinks half of it. Yeah, I finished it. Can you blame me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went back to my room and, after the head trauma subsided, fell asleep to a late night showing of "Adventures in Babysitting". &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33265747-7019956918614023809?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Don)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269511858204"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13030">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c605b75a9d498cc9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">The Pope Ignored Child Rape.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reports that Cardinal Ratzinger (aka THE GUY WHO IS NOW THE POPE), as &lt;strong&gt;head of the organization&lt;/strong&gt; that was supposed to investigate and defrock molester priests, personally ignored cries for help from Milwaukee in 1996 when Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy was engaging in a &lt;strong&gt;200-child no-holds-barred rape-a-thon&lt;/strong&gt;. Oh yeah and the kids were deaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratzinger never responded to the Wisconsin dioceses, and instead after 8 months his second-in-command asked them to begin a trial, which he then halted after receiving a whiney letter from poor Father Murphy. Did Murphy ask the trial not to go forward because he was innocent? No! Of course not! He didn’t need a trial because he had already repented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, okay then. Go on and rape some more kids and repent again. No worries!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of being disciplined, Father Murphy was quietly moved by Archbishop William E. Cousins of Milwaukee to the Diocese of Superior in northern Wisconsin in 1974, where he spent his last 24 years working freely with children in parishes, schools and, as one lawsuit charges, a juvenile detention center. He died in 1998, still a priest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you still not angry? Read on! &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, with complaints about Father Murphy landing on his desk, Archbishop Weakland hired a social worker specializing in treating sexual offenders to evaluate him. After four days of interviews, the social worker said that Father Murphy had admitted his acts, had probably molested about 200 boys and felt no remorse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakland did nothing for three years, and then only acted because people were starting to catch on. This is par for the course. Throughout this scandal and others, the Church only gives a shit when they’re about to get caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities in Milwaukee were just as complicit for failing to do anything to help the victims or prosecute the rapist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father Murphy not only was never tried or disciplined by the church’s own justice system, but also got a pass from the police and prosecutors who ignored reports from his victims, according to the documents and interviews with victims. Three successive archbishops in Wisconsin were told that Father Murphy was sexually abusing children, the documents show, but never reported it to criminal or civil authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, is anyone still arguing that the Catholic Church and the Pope in particular deserve anything but our disgust? I know this whole “priests raping little kids” thing is so old hat that it’s now in the realm of being joked about and glossed over, but every time I read another account, I get angrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I have nothing but a string of profanity to direct at them. I know some friends and members of my family are religious, and I know some of them feel that religion and religious people deserve our respect. Those people may want to stop reading here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck the Catholic Church with their childish secret society built on hateful lies and brutal torture. Fuck the Pope in his blinged-out gold chains bought with the money donated by the children he helped rape. Fuck their imaginary god-man who sat on a cloud watching it all happen, munching on rainbows and keeping his ways mysterious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it’s all for a greater plan, isn’t it? God will reveal it to those kids when they reach the pearly gates, you know, unless of course they kill themselves, which is maybe about &lt;a href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1530156705600585"&gt;10 to 13 times more likely in children who have been sexually abused&lt;/a&gt; but fuck ‘em because the Catholic Church says suicide is a major sin that Jesus might decide to punish with an eternity in hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get that if you were raised Catholic, you were brainwashed with all the stupid shit about &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2008/07/warning-you-may-be-insulted/"&gt;crackers actually turning into flesh&lt;/a&gt; and a god that impregnates a girl so she can give birth to him so that he can get himself killed so he can go back to heaven so he can forgive the toys he made for disobeying the rules he made, and I get that you want to hold on to those beliefs because otherwise life is weird and scary or it just never occurred to you that life might be different to what you thought when you were four years old. I get it! So that’s fine. Keep on believing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But please stop believing that you need to give money, time, trust, and love to this vile organization of real-life demons and monsters. You might think your parish is different, that your priest is better, but please remember that that’s what everybody else thought, too. They don’t care about your soul. They don’t care about your life. They don’t care about your kids. They will take your money to buy more gold crosses, and they will rape you and hide the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, one more thing: If you live in the UK and you don’t want your tax dollars paying for the child-rape-hiding Pope to visit our fair isles, you can &lt;a href="http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/ProtestthePope/"&gt;sign this petition&lt;/a&gt; and let the Prime Minister know how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269507814508"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=7333">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/63aba2bf0522f6fa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="environment"/><category term="journalism"/><category term="science"/><category term="technology"/><category term="energy"/><category term="global warming"/><category term="nuclear power"/><category term="scientific american"/><category term="skeptoid"/><category term="solar power"/><category term="wind power"/><title type="html">Scientific American, Please Stay on Track</title><published>2010-03-25T09:00:39Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T09:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/03/25/scientific-american-please-stay-on-track/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a Scientific American reader ever since I picked one up in my twenties at the home of my girlfriend’s parents (now my wife’s), as her dad was an exec at Hughes Space Systems and a top expert in photovoltaics. But I have to say, lately they’ve run a few opinion articles that I can’t completely agree with, focusing on energy. They seem to have adopted a clearly anti-nuclear bias (anyone who listens to my podcast knows that &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4092"&gt;I’m a big nuclear fan&lt;/a&gt;), and are even critical of fusion research. The April 2010 issue features an article by Bill McKibben, scholar in residence at Middlebury College, and from what I can tell, something of a Luddite, not that there’s anything wrong with that. It smacks of a disturbing trend I see a lot of lately, where anticorporatism (which is as worthy a philosophy as any) is greenwashed with a supposedly environmental, scientific agenda (which is dishonest and does a disservice). We should not make science decisions that promote our favorite philosophies, we should make science decisions that best serve our planet and our people. They may coincide in many cases, but they don’t always. Here is a snip from a sidebar in McKibben’s article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job one, on almost anybody’s list, is conservation. The consulting firm McKinsey &amp;amp; Company estimated in 2008 that existing technologies could cut world energy demand 20 percent by 2020. For supply, it makes financial sense to generate power close to home. Most communities spend 10 percent of their money for fuel, and almost all of it disappears, off to Saudi Arabia or Exxon. Yet in 2008 the Institute for Local Self-Reliance showed that nearly half of all American States could meet their energy needs entirely within their borders, “and the vast majority could meet a significant percentage.” Wind turbines and rooftop solar could provide 81 percent of New York’s power, for instance, and almost one third of Ohio’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll begin by stating that McKibben and I agree in principal almost entirely. We do need to completely replace our fossil fuel driven power grid, and as quickly as possible. With that said, I disagree with virtually every single point he makes. Let’s go one by one:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job one, on almost anybody’s list, is conservation. The consulting firm McKinsey &amp;amp; Company estimated in 2008 that existing technologies could cut world energy demand 20 percent by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conservation has never proven to be a satisfactory strategy to solve virtually any shortage. Spending money to replace refrigerators and air conditioners with Energy Star compliant models is money that should instead be thrown at the Big Solution: small, incremental steps are time wasted. If 20 percent is the maximum we can expect from this, it’s clearly a non-starter. We need 100 percent replacement of fossil fuels. We need the giant leap. And if you depend on people shutting off the water while they shave, or driving more slowly, or turning off the lights when they leave the room, your strategy is guaranteed to fail. Should they? Yes. Will they? No. The habits of Ed Begley Jr. do not represent those of most people. Don’t depend on something that won’t happen; solve the problem instead. This lesson has had to be re-learned every time we’ve depended upon people to choose to conserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For supply, it makes financial sense to generate power close to home… Wind turbines and rooftop solar could provide 81 percent of New York’s power, for instance, and almost one third of Ohio’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in rare cases, like rooftop hot water systems. Rooftop solar and wind? No way, not even close, probably not even if you depend upon the unsustainable government subsidies we now enjoy. Things like transformers and maintenance and upgrades are the realities of these systems. These are intractable for the average homeowner, but they are trivial for a centralized power station that has the personnel, the money, and the means. Significantly, they also enjoy vast economies of scale. One large transformer for a neighborhood is far more efficient than a thousand small ones; one giant wind generator with 100 moving parts and a team of dedicated technicians walks all over a thousand small, unmaintained generators with 100,000 moving, breakable parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmission loss is a real factor, to be sure. But it’s more than made up for by the tremendous economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most communities spend 10 percent of their money for fuel, and almost all of it disappears, off to Saudi Arabia or Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to call foul on McKibben for this one. Only a tiny fraction of our fossil fuel comes from Saudi Arabia, and almost none from hostile Mideast countries. We produce well over a third of it domestically, and most that we import comes from Canada, Mexico, and non-Arab OPEC countries like Nigeria and Venezuela. Most of what remains does indeed come from Saudi Arabia, but it totals merely about a sixth. Cries of “Buying gas and oil sends your money to those evil woman-hating, hand-chopping, Muslim Saudis” are weasel words designed to frighten and sensationalize. Are you enriching Exxon? Yes. Are you enriching Saudi Arabia? Hardly. That he puts them in the same sentence implies that they are both equally bad places to send your money. Exxon is evil to those who embrace anticorporatism; Saudi Arabia is evil to those who embrace human rights. Equating the two is a wonderfully debatable topic, which I’d love to hear; but it’s not science, and has no place in a publication purporting to offer science-based solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269504658423"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/clock_quotes_604.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09852e2f08849e6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2010-03-25T08:54:29Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T08:54:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/zlvHbIV0hk0/clock_quotes_604.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/clock_quotes_604.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanna do a better album each time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of three experiments, seven gorillas, eight chimpanzees,  four bonobos and seven orangutans, from the Wolfgang Köhler Research  Center at the Leipzig Zoo in Germany, were presented with two hollow  tubes, one baited with a food reward, the other not. The apes were then  observed as they tried to find the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, the apes were prevented from watching the  baiting but the tubes were shaken to give them auditory information  about the reward’s location instead. Dr. Call wanted to see if when the  apes were prevented from acquiring visual information, but offered  auditory cues instead, they would be able to use the auditory  information to reduce their reliance on visual searching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to parse out this “more shots than everyone else” statement.  Some countries–Haiti, for example–give far fewer vaccines due not to fewer recommendations but to adverse economic conditions. Because of this, they have very high rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.  They want to vaccinate more, but can’t.  Then there are countries who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; afford to vaccinate. Let’s look at what three industrialized nations recommend before six years of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccinations, by disease and country, 0-6 years of age &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chart, as I’ve presented it, is somewhat imprecise.  Some vaccinations are given in a single shot, others in multiple shots, but these generally represent the childhood vaccinations in each country, and the links provided will take you to the more detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I understand Dr. McCarthy correctly, she is using the alleged difference in national vaccine recommendations to show that it is safe to vary vaccination schedules by some method or another.  I would not disagree: vaccination schedules should not be immutable but should (and do) change based on available evidence. But changes should not be based on one or another person’s “feelings”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other implication is that other countries, by having one-third fewer vaccinations (&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;), will have lower rates of autism.  She bases her assertions about international vaccination rates and autism on &lt;a href="http://www.rescuepost.com/files/gr-autism_and_vaccines_world_special_report1.pdf"&gt;a report self-published by her anti-vaccination&lt;/a&gt; group Generation Rescue.  In this screed, they allege that the number of “mandatory vaccines” are much greater in the U.S. (there are no “mandatory” vaccines in the US, only those that are recommended or those required for various jobs or schools).  It’s not clear to me how they arrive at their numbers.  Perhaps they count the total number of vaccinations given for each disease (i.e., each DPT counts as three vaccinations, given five times for “15 vaccinations).  Using this method, by my count France “mandates” 35 vaccinations by year six (they report 17) and the U.S. has 36, as they reported.  But this isn’t the counting method they say they used.  In the footnotes they say that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All vaccine schedules are as of 2006. Some countries use combination vaccines. All schedule counts have been&lt;br&gt;
normalized to compare to the US schedule. For example, if a country uses an MMR-Varicella combination vaccine, it&lt;br&gt;
counts as “2” vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report then goes on to try to link these supposedly vastly different vaccine schedules to supposedly vastly different autism rates in the EU vs. the U.S. (If you understand their “methods” better than I do, feel free to explain in the comments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/dissemination/diseases/autism_1.pdf"&gt;European autism statistics&lt;/a&gt; are scarce, but high end estimates place them at up to 63/10,000, or 0.9/150, compared to a US estimate of 1/150.  This is hardly a smoking gun, and the “study’s” so-called multipliers are simply error multipliers, given the large range in prevalence estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jenny McCarthy’s senseless ramblings on health are based on more formal senseless ramblings from a special interest group whose “special interest” appears to be the promotion of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

(members only).

The letter to the editor was written by my colleague at the University of Kansas, Lindy Landzaat, DO (a 2009 Harvard HPM Fellowship grad) based on Drew&amp;#39;s post about Continuous-Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD).  This came about because I knew of Lindy&amp;#39;s interest in LVAD&amp;#39;s since she had presented at the 2009 Case Conference in Austin on the topic, and encouraged her to write the letter after reading Drew&amp;#39;s post.  The three of us worked on it over the next week with Lindy doing the bulk of the work.  It was submitted in mid-December and we got word soon after that it was approved for publication with a few minor revisions.

One important piece to include was a citation to the Pallimed since it really demonstrated the source of some of the viewpoints and allowed an expansion on the subject that a letter to the editor word limit would not allow.

Here is the sentence from the letter to the editor that was referenced:

Though left ventricular assist devices are increasingly helpful and reliable, they still represent a form of life support with a specific set of burdens and complications, particularly as patients die: difficult decisions for patients, families, and doctors surrounding planned device discontinuation; device failure; symptom-management issues; and coordinating end-of-life care that honors patients&amp;#39; wishes and values. 2

And here is how the citation looks:

2. Rosielle D. Rise of the machines. In: Rosielle D, Sinclair C, eds. Pallimed: a hospice &amp;amp; palliative medicine blog. (Accessed March 4, 2010, at http://www.pallimed.org/2009/12/rise-of-machines.html.)(More on citing a blog in this Pallimed post. If you ever cite a blog it is always nice to leave a mention on the blog referenced.)

Pallimed Readers Stand Up! 

Now this is not the first time a blog has been cited in a medical journal (Geripal had a reference in Lancet in Sep 2009 [damn upstarts!]), but I am also hoping that it will not be the last.  This moment raises many important issues about the exchange of ideas and blogs:

Transports information from blogs to the relatively insulated world of medical journals

Gains increased awareness about palliative care issues by keeping them in medical journals via letters to the editors, editorials

Reinforces blogging as a scholarly effort

Increases awareness of journal readers that blogs are a credible source of informal and post-publication peer review

Achieves formal archiving in the medical institutional memory of  important points brought up in blogs

Allows blog readers a streamlined path towards increasing publications

Crosslinks open access (blogs) with paywall access content 

So earlier Wednesday night I spoke with Eric Widera of GeriPal and we have decided to start a workgroup to help help translate information from palliative care related blogs into academic journals.  This is a work in progress and open to any readers that would like to participate.  Some ideas of how it might work:

Any post on Pallimed or GeriPal (or another blog if you are interested) that cites a recent journal article is eligible.

If you find a post that resonates with you and you want to write up a letter to the editor, just comment on the article and email the author of the post. (If you don&amp;#39;t know who that is email me at ctsinclair@gmail.com)

Gather the deadline, word count, submission instruction info for the cited journal

Within a week after the post is up (or sooner if necessary) the final authors for the letter will be confirmed and work will proceed by email to submit before the deadline.

With enough effort behind this we could start a listing of letters to the editor or editorials that were seeded by a blog post and demonstrate the effort of the crowd as a whole to contribute to medical information exchange.  But you must be the catalyst.  We have nearly 3000 subscribers, so if only 5% of our readers were interested in doing this we would have 150 people nearly continuously as a loose group working on letters.  That could be huge!

What we need from you: 

More ideas on how this could (or could not) work

Your willingness to contribute and write a letter based off already formed themes.

Your desire to be first author on letters to many top notch journals

A cool name for this workgroup/project including some of the following words or phrases: blogs, social media, translation, stupendous, project, workgroup, GeriPal, Pallimed, awesome,add your own.

So are you in?

&lt;div&gt;Today is &lt;a href="http://findingada.com/about/"&gt;Ada Lovelace Day&lt;/a&gt;, darling little muffins!  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_lovelace"&gt;Ada Lovelace&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the infamous English poet and renowned rascal &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron"&gt;Lord Byron&lt;/a&gt;, lived in the early 19th century and is widely regarded as the first computer programmer and developer of the first computer algorithm.  According to the founders, &amp;quot;Ada Lovelace Day is an international day of blogging to celebrate the achievements of women in technology and science.&amp;quot;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt; I think people tend to write about famous women in STEM on Ada Lovelace Day, but today I am thinking more about the path that led The Countess of Lovelace to become one of the greatest mathematicians of her day.  Ada Lovelace was abandoned by her father as a child and was raised primarily by her mother, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Isabella_Milbanke"&gt;Annabella Noel Byron&lt;/a&gt;.  Although Lady Byron certainly had motives for directing Ada Lovelace&amp;#39;s studies towards the analytical, there&amp;#39;s no doubt that her mother provided her the educational foundation for her later success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this has me thinking about the heroes that we often fail to recognize when we pay tribute to the great women of science - the mentors and guides that helped them develop the potential to do great things.  Ada Lovelace had her mother.  Marie Curie had her sister Bronisława, who supported her financially while she attended the University of Paris.  Maria Mitchell was influenced by women suffragists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton before founding the &lt;a title="American Association for the Advancement of Women (page does not exist)" href="http://scienceblogs.com/w/index.php?title=American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Women&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;redlink=1"&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Women&lt;/a&gt; and eventually being elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suppose part of why I am thinking about the importance of mentoring lately is because of some experiences I have been having.  Granted, I am doing incredibly hot science, and I am generally pretty amazing, but I&amp;#39;m also not naive enough to think that I have all of science on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk"&gt;lockdown&lt;/a&gt;.  There are a lot of parts of this game that I&amp;#39;m new at and still learning.  That is why I have been so thankful to have a couple of very positive role models to look to.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recently joined a committee that I have never participated in before.  They do activities that I&amp;#39;ve never done before, and I basically constantly feel like I am no good at it.  Having never done anything like this before, and finding myself having to integrate into a group that has a solid understanding of procedure and that has a long history of working together, I find myself constantly worried that I am either holding up the show or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/Science.jpg"&gt;am doing it all wrong&lt;/a&gt;.  Within the group, I&amp;#39;ve found a role model that I have come to respect and that I am very thankful for.  I thought that on this Ada Lovelace Day, as I&amp;#39;ve reflected on the influence her mother had on her education, I&amp;#39;d write a few words about this person who is influencing me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN:0pt 0pt 20px 20px;FLOAT:right" alt="mentor in stained glass.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/mentor%20in%20stained%20glass.jpg" width="216" height="235"&gt;I obviously can&amp;#39;t tell you who she is, but I can do the next best thing - Photoshop her faculty picture, stained glass-style.  I think she&amp;#39;ll find it hilarious.  Or creepy.  Or hilariously creepy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been thinking a lot about why I have found this woman&amp;#39;s guidance to be so helpful, and I think a lot of it has to do with how she makes me feel about my own naivety.   Sometimes I notice a particular trait in myself that I&amp;#39;m not proud of - obvious frustration with people less experienced when they don&amp;#39;t quickly pick up a skill that I have already mastered.   This particular person has never made me feel like my naive meanderings are wasting her time.  She&amp;#39;s carefully considered the things I have suggested and pointed me to resources that might be helpful, rather than telling me directly how to complete a task.  I&amp;#39;ve appreciated how that has nurtured my independence as I&amp;#39;ve worked toward completing my first task on this committee.  When she has felt the need to offer guidance, she&amp;#39;s done it gently and &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socratically"&gt;Socratically&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;quot;Isis, what do you think about doing it this way?&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;For fuck&amp;#39;s sake, Isis!  Why didn&amp;#39;t you do it like this?  I told you to do it like this!&amp;quot;  I appreciate that even though she&amp;#39;s more senior than me in her career, she&amp;#39;s made me feel welcome to use her as a resource.  I also admire that she has garnered an authority that comes from her reputation for empowering others, fairness, and good judgment, rather than an authority that comes from dominating others into submission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I suppose on Ada Lovelace Day it&amp;#39;s important to remember the great women in STEM, but it&amp;#39;s also important to remember the great women who motivate us and empower us.  I think that each of us stands on the shoulders of the great women who came before us, and I am pretty lucky to stand on the shoulders of some of the greatest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in the comments after my post on cranks attacking the concept of a scientific consensus, a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/hostility_towards_a_scientific_consensus.php#comment-2374398"&gt;reader named Craig wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We don't talk about consensus on these issues today merely because the consensus is so strong that only a dedicated guanophrenic would ever question them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Guanophrenic"? I love that word. It has the prefect combination of meaning, in essence, "shithead," while having a delightfully clever implication of bats as in "batshit insane." Of course, being a physician, I'd probably prefer the term "guanocephalic" proposed later in the comment thread. Either way, I'll steal it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/a_new_favorite_word.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/e3iTom9Ol1c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269490148172"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/autisms-false-prophets-out-in-paperback.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82547b2b5243298e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Skepticism and Quackery"/><category term="Vaccination"/><title type="html">Autism's False Prophets Out in Paperback</title><published>2010-03-25T03:49:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-25T03:49:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/autisms-false-prophets-out-in-paperback.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">From &lt;a href="http://www.cupblog.org/?p=1575"&gt;Columbia Univeristy Press&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Offit’s best-selling &lt;a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14636-4/autisms-false-prophets"&gt;Autism’s False Prophets: Bad Science, Risky Medicine, and the Search for a Cure&lt;/a&gt; is now available in paperback with a new preface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the hardcover was first published in 2008 events have kept the book in the headlines. Most notably was &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;’s decision to retract Andrew Wakefield’s article which claimed a link between vaccines and autism. Recently, Chris Mooney interviewed Paul Offit on the popular podcast &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/paul_offit_the_costs_of_vaccine_denialism/"&gt;Points of Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by Chris Mooney. In the interview, Offit discusses the state of the vaccine skeptic movement in light of [the news about Wakefield]. In particular, Offit explores why the tides may be turning on the movement—as well as the grave public health consequences of ongoing vaccine avoidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the interview, Mooney wrote about three insights:&lt;/p&gt;

Many parts of children with autism do not agree with the idea of vaccine causation and are angry that it has dominated public discussion of autism&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/02/17/insights-from-the-paul-offit-interview-part-iii-the-resurgence-of-diseases/"&gt;The anti-vaccination fervor is contributing to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbia University Press filmed an interview with Dr. Offit as a part of the book&amp;#39;s launch &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the debate Deepak claimed that the moon is nothing more than a soup of teeming quantum uncertainty. No. Subatomic particles may be altered when they are observed, but the moon is there even if no one looks at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepak apparently read this and replied.  Shermer posts Chopra’s replies in &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/michaelshermer/2010/03/18/does-the-moon-exist-if-there-are-no-sentient-beings-to-look-at-it/"&gt;Does the moon exist if there are no sentient beings to look at it?&lt;/a&gt;  See if you can spot the equivocation / moving of goalposts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Quoting Chopra] When you see an object, the moon being the example you chose, your eyes are not really “seeing” the moon. Your eyes are responding to photons that follow all the rules of wave-particle duality.  […]  There was no moon till it was an experience in your consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chopra just can’t be honest.  In the first paragraph, he is claiming the the Moon literally isn’t there (it’s just “a soup of teeming quantum uncertainty”) if no one looks at it.  Shermer calls him on this nonsense.  Chopra, slyly moves the goalposts and replies that now it’s the &lt;em&gt;photons&lt;/em&gt; that enter your eyes that exhibit the quantum uncertainty.  He hopes you won’t notice the switch – that he is now talking about &lt;em&gt;photons&lt;/em&gt; hitting your eyes (and creating the image of the Moon), and &lt;em&gt;not the Moon itself&lt;/em&gt; that is subject to quantum uncertainty.  He has, effectively, conceded that the Moon is still there (and of course it must be – otherwise, where would the photons have been reflected from in the first place?), although he hopes you won’t notice that he actually just disproved his own point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, even if we are just referring to photons following all the rules of wave-particle duality, there is still no reason to suppose that consciousness is necessary.  Chopra has a longer piece up on the huff Post - &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/which-is-real-the-moon-or_b_509174.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Which Is Real, the Moon or God?&lt;/a&gt;, where he makes this claim (if you can be bothered to wade through over 2,000 words some of of the most dense woo I have ever read).  According to Chopra, everything is quantum, which means everything is consciousness, therefore god exists, or something: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic understanding of the collapse of the wave function is called the Copenhagen Interpretation, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the Copenhagen Interpretation is just one way of looking at the situation.  It may represent reality, it may not, but it is not the “basic understanding” of QM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in which a non-material observer is involved in quantum measurement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the “non-material” wording, that is (rather trivially) correct.  Clearly something (could be a human; could be a measuring instrument) has to “measure” something.  There is no evidence that that thing has to be “non-material.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John von Neumann demonstrated that an understanding of the collapse of the wave function requires consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No he didn’t.  As I wrote in my review of &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html"&gt;What the Bleep Do We Know&lt;/a&gt;, the theory of quantum mechanics doesn’t say this. Chopra is confusing the &lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt; of quantum mechanics with an &lt;em&gt;interpretation&lt;/em&gt; of quantum mechanics. This is an explanation to help understand what &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be going on, but it is not part of the theory because it is not falsifiable: it cannot be tested in such a way that, if it were false, it would fail the test (without falsifying the whole of quantum mechanics, and therefore all the other interpretations too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To falsify this interpretation you would have to see what would happen without a conscious observer monitoring the experiment. But that’s Catch-22: you need a conscious observer monitoring the experiment to see what happens. You can’t look at the experiment without looking at it so no one can ever know if this interpretation is true.  So although von Neumann may have believed such a thing, he never demonstrated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without an observer, there is no collapse, no particle, no matter, no measurement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, but the “observer” can be something &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;non&lt;/span&gt; material – a scientific instrument, say.  There is no reason to suppose that consciousness is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative quantum theories such as transactional interpretation and many-worlds theory try to get around the need of consciousness or an observer, but fail in the end. Essentially they don&amp;#39;t fulfill the requirements of quantum physics because any quantum measuring device still must be physical and ultimately exist as quantum wave probabilities. One set of measuring waves superimposed on other waves to be measured, only leaves more waves, not particles, not a quantified measurement. And as Niels Bohr makes clear, in quantum mechanics, if it isn&amp;#39;t measureable it isn&amp;#39;t real. So in spite of these newer quantum speculations, no one has been able to successfully dispense with a non-material observer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course no one has been able to dispense with an observer.  But it does not have to be a “non-material observer” as Chopra claims.  In fact, Chopra has not even demonstrated that such a thing as a “non-material observer” even exists.  Someone, ultimately, has to look at the measuring instrument to see what the result was.  Obviously.  Someone has to open the box and look at the cat.  But until that person does that , there is no way to know what the result was without consciousness, and so there is no justification for saying that consciousness is necessary.  Sorry Deepak, you don’t understand what you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Sigh.)  Anyway, back to the original question raised in the post title - if we all ignored Deepak Chopra, would he cease to exist, would he disappear in a soup of &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;teaming&lt;/span&gt; teeming quantum uncertainty?  Although we might perhaps wish this to be true, I have to say that, no, even if we all ignored him, Chopra would still exist to spew out more quantum drivel tomorrow, the next day, and the next day ad infinitum.  At least it gives me something to blog about.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269486928217"><id gr:original-id="http://noustuff.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/prospective-memory-in-asd/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0796c00db9557af1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Prospective Memory in ASD</title><published>2010-03-24T21:57:33Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T21:57:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/R-PZDJpDerA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://noustuff.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/prospective-memory-in-asd/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Prospective Memory (PM or ProM- I’ll be using the term PM) is defined as a number of functions that enable a person to carry out an intended act after a delay (Burgess et al., 2001).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/03/polling-creationismevolution-controversy-005388"&gt;Polling the creationism/evolution controversy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2010/03/polling-creationismevolution-controversy-005388"&gt;&lt;img title="piechart.thumbnail" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/piechart-thumbnail.jpg?w=190&amp;amp;h=179" alt="" width="190" height="179"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NCSE is pleased to announce a new section of its website that &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls-surveys"&gt;provides&lt;/a&gt; information on polls and surveys relevant to the creationism/evolution  controversy. You’ve seen the alarming statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution is &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2009/07/views-evolution-among-public-scientists-004904"&gt;accepted&lt;/a&gt; by 97% of scientists in the United States,  but by only 61% of the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among thirty-two countries &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2006/08/public-acceptance-evolution-science-00991"&gt;surveyed&lt;/a&gt;, the United States was next-to-last for  its public acceptance of evolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One out of eight high school biology teachers in the United States &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/news/2008/05/evolution-creationism-americas-classrooms-002271"&gt;presents&lt;/a&gt; creationism as scientifically credible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can find it all in a single spot — NCSE’s coverage and links to  external resources — organized in the categories of general polls,  international polls, polls on creationism, polls on evolution, polls on  religion, and scientist, student, and teacher polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, all of the polling &amp;amp; survey information is broken down and sorted into &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls-surveys"&gt;a variety of very convenient categories&lt;/a&gt; for your perusal…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/general-polls"&gt;General  Polls&lt;/a&gt; are polls of the general public on a national or state level  on evolution, creationism, or some combination of the two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/international-polls"&gt;International  Polls&lt;/a&gt; collects all polls from outside the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/polls-creationism"&gt;Polls  on Creationism&lt;/a&gt; contains all polls relating to a supernatural origin  of life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/polls-evolution"&gt;Polls on  Evolution&lt;/a&gt; are polls looking at public perception, understanding,  and acceptance of evolution and science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/polls-religion"&gt;Polls on  Religion&lt;/a&gt; look at opinions on the compatibility of science and  religion, or perception of evolution by religion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/scientist-polls"&gt;Scientist  Polls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/student-polls"&gt;Student  Polls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/polls/teacher-polls"&gt;Teacher Polls&lt;/a&gt; look at polls of specific audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time you need to reference a poll when in the midst of a discussion of the creationism/evolution issue, you have a great resource.  In addition, I just want to give a general shout-out to the NCSE because they are, in my humble opinion, &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; go-to folks for dealing with creationists.  In fact, I encourage you to &lt;a href="http://ncse.com/membership"&gt;support them by becoming a member!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And the most distressing news was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists were disturbed when it emerged that Ralph Cicerone, the president of the NAS, personally nominated the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What? The president of the National Academy nominated the winner of a prize for conflating science and faith?  The &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; published my reaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Coyne, a biologist at the University of Chicago, said: “It is shameful that the president of the premier science organisation in America has endorsed a prize for conflating science with religion, indeed, has nominated someone for doing the best job of blurring the boundaries between science and faith. The job of the NAS president is to promote rationality, not pollute it with superstition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two other critics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the National Academy of Sciences to get involved with an organisation like this is dangerous,” said Sir Harry Kroto, a British scientist who won the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1996 and later joined Florida State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The National Academy should look very carefully at what the majority of its members feel about the apparent legitimising of the scientific credentials of the Templeton Foundation.” he said. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . The NAS said it agreed to host the event because the winner was an NAS member. Sean Carroll, a physicist at California Institute of Technology, said: “Templeton has a fairly overt agenda that some scientists are comfortable with, but very many are not. In my opinion, for a prestigious scientific organisation to work with them sends the wrong message.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Rosen of the Templeton Foundation said: “This year’s prizewinner is a distinguished scientist who has made a profound contribution to the science-religion dialogue. The NAS is a perfect place to celebrate his achievements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm . . . now who could be a National Academy member who has spent a lot of time trying to unite science and faith?  This rules out Kenneth Miller, who’s not in the Academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m putting my money on &lt;strong&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s Collins, I wonder exactly what “profound” contribution Templeton sees him as having made to the “science-religion dialogue.”  It couldn’t be his book, &lt;em&gt;The Language of God&lt;/em&gt;, which by any standard—academic, theological, or scientific—&lt;a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060815_sam_harris_language_ignorance/"&gt;is as far from profound as you can get&lt;/a&gt;.  That leaves one achievement: Collins is an evangelical Christian and a high-ranking scientist who isn’t shy about publicly mixing his job with his faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/03/atheists-question-faith-in-science-academy-over-prize/1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; quoted a couple more shrill and militant atheists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has brought ignominy on itself by agreeing to host the announcement,” wrote well-known scientist and author &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5304"&gt;Richard Dawkins, on his blog Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This is exactly the kind of thing Templeton is ceaselessly angling for – recognition among real scientists – and they use their money shamelessly to satisfy their doomed craving for scientific respectability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Minnesota, Morris, biologist P.Z. Myers also weighed in, saying “Bad form, NAS,” on his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/very_bad_form_nas.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+scienceblogs%2Fpharyngula+%28Pharyngula%29"&gt;Pharyngula blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Spats over science, religion and atheism have flared up frequently among opinion writers in recent years, notably with last year’s appointment of genome expert Francis Collins, an evangelical Christian, as head of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By  hosting this prize, but especially by &lt;em&gt;nominating&lt;/em&gt; someone for this prize, the National Academy has put its official imprimatur on superstition and woo.  It’s a huge embarrassment, but nobody will be more embarrassed than the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism"&gt;93% of physicists and biologists in the Academy who are atheists&lt;/a&gt;. Bad form indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Jenny may &lt;i&gt;think &lt;/i&gt;she understands what this means, but I doubt it.  Some countries--Haiti, for example--give far fewer vaccines than we do because they are desperately poor and in a constant state of crisis. Because of this, they have very high rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.  They want to vaccinate more, but can&amp;#39;t.  Then there are countries who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; afford to vaccinate. Let's look at what three industrialized nations recommend before six years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Imagine that you are are standing in a massive junkyard with the remains of cars strewn all about you. A few are relatively complete, but most of the heap is made up of bits and pieces of models from the entire history of automotive innovation. If you were to reach down and pick up one of the scraps, would you be able to tell the make and model of the car it came from?

The challenges a paleontologist faces in reconstructing the life of the past are not much different. Complete, articulated remains of prehistoric organisms are rare. More often than not, paleontologists must turn their attention to scraps; a piece of skull, a broken tooth, an isolated leaf, a shard of shell, and so on. It takes years to build up the mental catalog of characteristics necessary to properly identify these petrified bits and pieces, and even then paleontologists are sometimes shocked to learn that fossils thought to belong to one kind of creature actually belonged to another. Such was the case with Megarachne, the giant spider that wasn't.

Vul, Harris, Winkielman, and Pashler produced a "bombshell of a paper" that questioned the  implausibly high correlations observed in some fMRI studies in the field  of Social  Neuroscience.  Ed Vul et al. surveyed the authors of 54 papers to  determine the analytic methods used. All but three of the authors  responded to the survey, and 54% admitted to using faulty methods to  obtain their results:More than half acknowledged using a  strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels, and  reports means of just the subset of voxels exceeding chosen thresholds.  We show how this non-independent analysis grossly inflates  correlations, while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This  analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the  implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we  argue that other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious  correlations in some cases.For background reading I suggest starting with Voodoo Correlations in Social Neuroscience. Given the paper's inflammatory title and its naming of names, the accused researchers did not take the criticism lying down (see Voodoo Schadenfreude).Here we have a public debate between Dr. Piotr Winkielman, one of the authors of the Voodoo paper (Vul et al. 2009, PDF), and Dr. Matthew Lieberman, one of the accused (rebuttal: Lieberman et al. 2009, PDF) at the 2009 meeting of the Society of Experimental Social Psychologists. Dr. Lieberman has made these videos and papers available on his website, and I thank him for drawing my attention to them.The Voodoo Debate Continues...Piotr Winkielman, opening remarks (21:12)Matt Lieberman, opening remarks (19:03) [better view of slides]Piotr Winkielman, rebuttal (10:22)...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

I’m very grateful to RealClimate for giving us the opportunity to respond to the recent posts on the investigation: “&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/the-guardian-disappoints/"&gt;The Guardian Disappoints&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/02/close-encounters-of-the-absurd-kind/"&gt;“Close Encounters of the Absurd Kind”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say first that we hold RealClimate in very high regard. The site is part of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/series/guardian-environment-network"&gt;Guardian Environment Network&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of more than 20 hand-picked websites including Grist and Nature’s Climate Feedback blog with whom we have a mutual content sharing agreement. Under the arrangement, the Guardian website republishes RealClimate blogs regularly. We take seriously your criticisms and are considering them carefully. The Guardian has a commitment to accuracy and correcting factual errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the public interest in this story that ever since the emails were released in November, there has been a strong demand for an in-depth journalistic account of what they tell us about how climate scientists operate. As RealClimate rightly pointed out, the response from much of the media has been lazy to the point of “pathology”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No other media organisation has come close to producing such a comprehensive and carefully researched attempt to get to the bottom of the emails affair. The investigation tries to reflect the complexity and historical context of the story, and runs to some 28,000 words – of which around half appeared in the printed newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schmidt did not mince his words though when he said that Fred’s investigation falls, “well below the normal Guardian standards of reporting”, while Dr Ben Santer wrote, “I am taking this opportunity to correct Mr. Pearce’s omissions, to reply to the key allegations, and to supply links to more detailed responses.” Both have also criticised our &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/help-write-the-full-story-of-the-hacked-emails-scandal"&gt;experimental online exercise&lt;/a&gt; to harness the expertise of people with a special knowledge of the emails in order to create a “peer reviewed” account of what they tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on that later, but it is wrong to suggest that this is a lazy substitute for traditional journalistic standards and that key protagonists were not invited to respond prior to publication. On the contrary, the investigation was subject to rigorous editorial checking and Fred contacted numerous individuals in the course of his research. Many (particularly those at UEA) declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other side of the story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RealClimate commentary reads like a distorted fairground mirror of the Guardian investigation – one that highlights the uncomfortable bits but blurs the rest. The posts did point out that “Some of the other pieces in this series are fine” but do not reflect the large amount of analysis in the investigation of the way the emails have been misused by those with a political agenda and the extensive context we included to indicate the pressure scientists writing those emails were under from time-consuming requests for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part 2 (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/climategate-bogus-sceptics-lies"&gt;How the ‘climategate’ scandal is bogus and based on climate sceptics’ lies&lt;/a&gt;), for example, we detail how the “hide the decline” email has been misused by Sarah Palin, Senator James Inhofe and others to create, apparently deliberately, the impression that climate scientists had fiddled the figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all the media and political discussion about the hacked climate emails has been based on soundbites publicised by professional sceptics and their blogs. In many cases, these have been taken out of context and twisted to mean something they were never intended to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part 1 (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/climate-change-data-request-war"&gt;Battle over climate data turned into war between scientists and sceptics&lt;/a&gt;) and in a separate piece that appeared in the newspaper (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2010/feb/03/hacked-climate-emails-sceptics-funding"&gt;Climate scientists have long been targets for sceptics&lt;/a&gt;) Fred outlines the tactics and motivations of some on the “sceptic” side of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this happened against the backdrop of a long-term assault by politically motivated, and commercially funded, climate-change deniers against the activities of many of the key scientists featuring in the emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly in Part 7 (Victory for openness as IPCC climate scientist opens up lab doors) Fred explains how the emails give a special insight into what being on the end of that assault was like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the leaked emails, [Ben Santer] is seen sharing those experiences with other victims of hectoring and abuse by the more rabid climate sceptics. Others had their own horror stories, including Mike Mann over his hockey stick graph, Kevin Trenberth over his analysis of hurricanes and warming in the aftermath of Katrina, and later Jones over his escalating data wars. In each case, they argue, legitimate debates about scientific analysis and access to researchers’ data have been turned into vindictive character assassination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the concluding part of the investigation (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/climate-emails-truth-global-warming"&gt;Part 12: Climate science emails cannot destroy argument that world is warming, and humans are responsible&lt;/a&gt;), Fred lays out unequivocally that nothing in the emails casts doubt on the case for climate change being attributable to human actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the science of climate change fatally flawed by the climategate revelations? Absolutely not. Nothing uncovered in the emails destroys the argument that humans are warming the planet. None of the 1,073 emails plus 3,587 files containing documents, raw data and computer code upsets the 200-year-old science behind the “greenhouse effect” of gases such as carbon dioxide, which traps solar heat and warms the atmosphere. Nothing changes the fact that carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere thanks to human emissions from burning carbon-based fuels such as coal and oil. Nor the calculations by physicists that for every square metre of the Earth’s surface, 1.6 watts more energy enters the atmosphere than leaves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know the world is warming as a result. Thousands of thermometers in areas remote from any conceivable local urban influences tell us that. The oceans are warming too. The great majority of the world’s glaciers are retreating, Arctic sea ice is disappearing, sea levels are rising ever faster, trees are climbing up hillsides and permafrost is melting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not statistical artefacts or the result of scientists cherry-picking data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking under every rock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few, if any newspapers in the world with a stronger commitment to action on climate change than the Guardian and our sister paper the Observer. We have a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/02/guardian-environment-team"&gt;team of 6 full-time environment correspondents&lt;/a&gt; as well as three editors and a collection of bloggers and columnists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Guardian that orchestrated a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/06/copenhagen-editorial"&gt;global editorial&lt;/a&gt; carried by 56 newspapers in 45 countries on 7th December 2009 to call for action from world leaders at Copenhagen. [RC: Also at &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/12/the-guardians-editorial/"&gt;RealClimate&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have been instrumental in supporting the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/sep/01/10-10-launch-ian-katz"&gt;10:10 climate change campaign&lt;/a&gt; which aims to inspire individuals, organisations and businesses to cut their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010. The UK branch of 10:10 has signed up nearly 60,000 people and over 4000 businesses and organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only by looking thoroughly under every rock can those of us pressing for action on climate change maintain with confidence that the scientific case remains sound. Fred’s investigation shows that confidence is indeed well placed, but to claim that the emails do not throw up some troubling issues looks like the inward-looking mentality that is sometimes (perhaps understandably) expressed in the emails themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two posts published so far on RealClimate come to over 8500 words and it has been suggested that a line by line response to each of the points made would not be productive. I say again that we are totally unembarrassed about correcting genuine errors, but many of the points raised at RealClimate are differences of interpretation. There were implications that the investigation omitted some key information which in fact appeared in Fred’s pieces – for example that the data on Chinese weather station locations from the Phil Jones et al 1990 Nature data were eventually released publicly and that the two studies Jones had threatened to keep out of the IPCC AR4 report were in fact cited there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I would like to make four points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dr Phil Jones, the head of the Climatic Research Unit at UEA has said in an interview with Nature that the handling of the records of the Chinese weather station data from his 1990 Nature paper (which Fred wrote about in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/weather-stations-china"&gt;part 5&lt;/a&gt; of the investigation) was “not acceptable… [it&amp;#39;s] not best practice,” and he &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/15/phil-jones-lost-weather-data"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that that stations “probably did move”. He added that he was considering a correction to Nature. To our knowledge, no other media organisation or blogger had used the emails to shed light on the controversy over the 1990 paper so a correction would not be on the table without the Pearce investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Dr. Schmidt states that we imply Dr Tom Wigley supported allegations of “fabrication” from climate sceptic Douglas Keenan. We do not make that assertion in the piece. Also, Dr Schmidt does not reproduce the most &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/weather-stations-china"&gt;eye-catching quotes&lt;/a&gt; from a May 2009 email from Wigley to Jones in which he raises serious doubts about the quality of Jones’s scientific team and his handling of the Chinese weather station data.The hacked emails do not include a response from Jones if there was one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; As Dr. Schmidt pointed out, we have made three small corrections to the piece “&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/02/hockey-stick-graph-climate-change"&gt;Controversy behind climate science’s ‘hockey stick’ graph&lt;/a&gt;” at the request of Dr Michael Mann, but none changed the main point the article was making, which was that in 1999, Mann’s hockey-stick reconstruction was the subject of intense academic debate amongst climate scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Neither of the RealClimate blogs dealt with Fred’s piece on &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/27/uea-hacked-climate-emails-foi"&gt;FOI requests&lt;/a&gt;, but a statement from the UK’s deputy information commissioner Graham Smith has made clear that he believes that FOI legislation was not followed correctly. He wrote, “The emails which are now public reveal that [climate sceptic David] Holland’s requests under the Freedom of Information Act were not dealt with as they should have been under the legislation. Section 77 of the Freedom of Information Act makes it an offence for public authorities to act so as to prevent intentionally the disclosure of requested information.” This is a serious issue worthy of discussion and debate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer-reviewed journalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned above our attempt to create a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/series/climate-wars-hacked-emails"&gt;definitive account of the emails&lt;/a&gt; by leveraging the expertise of people involved or with a special knowledge of the messages and the issues they discuss. This account will eventually be expanded into a book. In practice, this means us adding annotations from people to the online versions of the articles so that readers can watch a form of living peer-review in progress. Click on the yellow highlights in the pieces themselves to read the annotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This represents an extraordinary commitment to transparency that we believe is unique in journalism. What other news organisation would open itself to direct criticism in this way including, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/feb/09/weather-stations-china"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, annotations that read “this is absolutely false” and “this is really bad”? The respected Columbia Journalism Review has &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/us_press_digs_into_ipcc_story.php"&gt;praised the approach&lt;/a&gt;. “Regardless of whether you agree with Pearce or Schmidt, the Guardian’s approach appropriately acknowledges that evidence leaves room for some degree of interpretation. It is this kind of detailed, intellectually honest (even technologically innovative) reporting that news outlets like The New York Times should be striving for,” it wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same spirit we have showcased &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/feb/04/climate-consensus-under-strain"&gt;diverse critical opinions&lt;/a&gt; on the issues and our own coverage of them, including from Dr Myles Allen, Dr Vicky Pope, Dr Mike Hulme and the Guardian’s environment correspondent &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2010/feb/23/climate-scepticism-hacked-emails"&gt;Dr David  Adam&lt;/a&gt;. Again few newspapers would have reflected such diverse viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction from some to our online annotation exercise has been hostile though. On our letters pages &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/mar/04/inquiry-analysis-east-anglia"&gt;Dr Myles Allen and Dr Ben Santer&lt;/a&gt; wrote last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claiming to produce “the definitive” analysis now is a brazen attempt to pre-empt the inquiries’ conclusions…What is wrong with the old-fashioned approach of checking facts before publication? When the final version is published, you will no doubt make much of the fact that “everyone had a chance to comment”, implying that any statement that was not challenged must therefore be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our intention is not to undermine or pre-empt the ongoing inquiries into the CRU emails. Each of those has a very specific remit and none is attempting to produce a detailed account that uses the emails to shed light on recent climate controversies. Nor is this an exercise in blackmailing scientists into fact-checking on the cheap – if it were then it would be a monumental false-economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, this is a serious-minded attempt to make sense of a large volume of new information about a complex and highly charged issue. No other newspaper has ever offered its journalism up for very public and exacting scrutiny in this way. We sincerely invite those involved who know the issues most thoroughly to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>group</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269473159588"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22739">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d63fb0ce16e1881</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Christian Science Church Slowly Begins to Reform</title><published>2010-03-24T23:00:10Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T23:00:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/24/christian-science-church-slowly-begins-to-reform/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;After hearing all those horrific stories of Christian Science-practicing parents willing to let their children die rather than abandon their destructive and absurd beliefs, I’m glad to hear the church is taking one step forward by &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/nyregion/24heal.html?hp=&amp;amp;pagewanted2=&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;allowing followers to see doctors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not saying much, considering they’ve spent decades walking backwards… But it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… faced with dwindling membership and blows to their church’s reputation caused by its intransigence concerning medical treatment, even for children with grave illnesses, Christian Science leaders have recently found a new tolerance for medical care. For more than a year, leaders say, they have been encouraging members to see a physician if they feel it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more significantly, they have begun a public campaign to redefine their methods as a form of care that the broader public should consider as a supplement rather than a substitute for conventional treatment, like biofeedback, chiropractic or homeopathic care.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the broader public should understand there’s no credible evidence that “their methods” work and sane people would do best to abandon them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a “supplement.”  It’s a gigantic waste of time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a con.  Just like Chiropractics.  Just like Homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church is still being secretive about how it treats its own people, though, and followers who see actual doctors risk being shunned by their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Religious scholars say the church’s past reticence, even secrecy, in the face of what its leaders have considered persecution, makes it difficult to know how widely the new message is being embraced among members, or how long it will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly, the church has always said that its members were free to choose medical care. But some former Christian Scientists say those who consult doctors risk ostracism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church officials recently permitted two practitioners and two patients to talk about Christian Science treatments with a reporter from The New York Times — a rare public discussion that they said they hoped would demonstrate the commitment to transparency, and would help people understand their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would not discuss the care of children or let a reporter witness a treatment session. And neither practitioner was willing to discuss the new flexibility described by [church spokesperson] Mr. [Philip] Davis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new practices won’t bring back &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/03/31/faith-based-homicide/"&gt;Madeline Kara Neumann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or give &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/02/26/surviving-the-faith-based-medical-neglect-of-my-childhood-an-ex-christian-scientist%E2%80%99s-story/"&gt;Liz Heywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; back her leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe with this change of heart from the church, their tragedies don’t have to be in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this in the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/skepchick-quickies-3-24/"&gt;Quickies this morning&lt;/a&gt;, but today is &lt;a href="http://findingada.com/"&gt;Ada Lovelace Day&lt;/a&gt;, a day-long blogging event to celebrate women in technology and science. Named after the woman commonly considered to be the first computer programmer, the idea behind the day is to write about a woman in tech or science, past or present, who deserves a little heroine-worship love. I posted the following earlier on my &lt;a href="http://www.deliberatepixel.com/2010/03/24/ada-lovelace-day-2010"&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; about my own inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was difficult for me to pick a woman to write about for Ada Lovelace Day. While, as I grow older, I continue to meet and discover women in technology who are naturally, admiringly wonderful at what they do, they were so lacking in my immediate environment when my impressions were being formed that no particular one stands out as someone who impressed upon me such a thing was possible. No one heroine, no one woman to thank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one individual I think about a lot when I think about cultural expectations, pressures and possibilities for women in STEM fields. She’s not a woman, not quite yet. But she will be. And considering what her life and opportunities will be when this is the case is why the inspiration I have to offer for Ada Lovelace Day is my four-year-old daughter, Elizabeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as my daughter, Elizabeth has been familiar with computers from almost day one. When she was two, she inherited my PowerBook, which is still her main computer. It’s mostly used at this point for playing games on NickJr.com, but the ease with which she finds the site she wants and navigates the site through a variety of activities still impresses me. I didn’t have a computer until high school. I didn’t have the internet until college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always felt that if I had more exposure to technology earlier in my life, I would have been that much farther ahead in the career in which I ended up. Maybe instead of just ending up there, I would have been able to identify what I wanted to pursue and put myself on the proper path. I still feel as if I’m only now discovering what I want to do and what I can do. I also think that this knowledge would have helped me overcome one of my major hurdles during my computer science education by cutting down on how much I felt like a cultural outsider and how much the rest of the students kept me at arms’ length. It probably goes without saying seeing other women around me doing this as well would have also made a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize Elizabeth is never going to know a world without easy access to a computer. She is never going to know the idea that computers aren’t for her. The thought will never cross her mind – unless someone else puts it there. That’s why I work so hard towards making a place where the chance of that happening is increasingly low, and hopefully, eventually nonexistent. That way, no matter what path she chooses for herself, I know it will come from her own abilities and desires, not because of what someone told her she can or can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jen</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269472125851"><id gr:original-id="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-blind-is-double-blind.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/10cb47391356564c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">How Blind is Double-Blind?</title><published>2010-03-24T18:27:48Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T18:27:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/R-GQz8rPpRk/how-blind-is-double-blind.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2010/03/how-blind-is-double-blind.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">There's a rather timely article in the current American Journal of Psychiatry: Assuring That Double-Blind Is Blind.Generally, when the list of the authors' conflicts of interest (550  words) is nearly as long as the text of the paper (740 words), it's not a  good sign, but this one isn't bad. Perlis et al remind us that if you do a double-blind placebo controlled trial:The blind may be compromised in a variety of ways, however,  beginning with differences in medication taste or smell. Of  particular concern may be the emergence of adverse effects,  particularly when those adverse effects are known to be  associated with a specific medication ... Indeed, when the degree of unblinding is assessed in  antidepressant trials, multiple reports suggest that it is  extensive: at least three-quarters of patients are typically  able to correctly guess at their treatment assignment.  The point of a placebo-controlled trial is that neither the patients nor their doctors know whether they're getting the placebo or the real drug. Hence the strength of the placebo effect should be the same in each group, allowing the "real" drug effect to be measured.But if the drug causes side effects, as pretty much all do, then people could work out which group they're in by noticing whether they're feeling side effects or not. This might enhance the placebo effect in the drug group, and make the drug seem to work better than it really does. Or it might not. But the possibility that it might is worrying.This is called the active placebo effect. It's why I'm skeptical of claims that scopolamine and ketamine have rapid-acting but short lived antidepressant effects.  I may be wrong, but while both of these drugs have been shown to work better than placebo, both have very pronounced subjective effects, so there's no chance the blind will have been intact.Whether the active placebo effect also underlies the efficacy of established antidepressants like Prozac is very controversial. There have been 9 trials comparing antidepressants to active placebos, i.e. drugs that have similar side effects to antidepressants and that should therefore help to preserve the blind. (The active placebos were all atropine which is basically the same as scopolamine.)The trials were reviewed by antidepressant critic Joanna Moncrieff et al who found that the overall effect size of antidepressants vs. active placebos was d = 0.39. That's not very high, although it's not too bad, and ironically it's actually higher than the effect that Moncrieff's friend and fellow Prozac-baiter Irving Kirsch found in his famous 2008 antidepressant vs. sugar pill placebo meta-analysis, d=0.32. So if you take that seriously, the active placebo effect plays no part in antidepressant efficacy. However the active placebo trials are mostly small and old, so to be honest, we don't really know.*A point that's often overlooked is that a drug could have an active placebo effect via having a "real" psychoactive treatment effect. Diazepam (Valium), for example, has basically no peripheral side effects at all: unlike scopolamine it doesn't cause dry mouth, nausea, etc. But it is a tranquillizer; it causes calmness and, at higher doses, sleep. They're pretty noticeable. So if you were to give a depressed person Valium and tell them that it's not only a tranquillizer, it's an antidepressant, then the active placebo problem would arise.In fact, any active drug will also produce active placebo effects - almost by definition, if you think about it. These may be hard to disentangle from the "real" effects. Say you're anxious about giving a speech so you take some diazepam hoping to feel calmer. A short while later you feel the lovely warm tranquillizing feeling setting in. Phew, you're calm now, anxiety's gone, the speech will be no worry. That thought might well be tranquillizing in itself. In other words the anti-anxiety effects of diazepam are partially driven by active placebo responses due to... the anti-anxiety effects of diazepam.*This leads onto another point. Suppose a drug has a genuine effect which improves some of the symptoms of a disease. Does that drug "treat" that disease?  In a weak sense, yes, and it might be a helpful drug, but it's not a specific treatment. Morphine's very helpful in cancer, because it treats pain, but it doesn't cure cancer. Likewise insomnia is a symptom of depression, but we feel that in order to qualify as an antidepressant a drug has to treat the core symptoms: mood, anxiety, etc. rather than just being a sleeping pill.But suppose someone suffered from low mood and you gave them a treatment which stopped them feeling any moods or emotions. That solves their low mood problem: no mood, no problem. But is that a specific treatment for depression? It's a bit of a grey area, but many would say no.Many people say that this is exactly what SSRI antidepressants do: they blunt your emotions. That doesn't mean they're not helpful in depression: a lot of people find them very useful. I did. But then are they really "antidepressants", or just anti-mood? SSRIs are the drugs of choice not just  for depression but also most anxiety disorders, and OCD, etc. In fact they work better in OCD than they do in depression, relative to placebo. So are SSRIs actually anti-obsessives that happen to be helpful in some cases depression? Good question.Here's Chris Rock on the issue of non-specific effects...*Perhaps an ideal clinical trial of a psychiatric drug should have 4 groups: the drug you're studying, another psychotropic (e.g. Valium), an active placebo with purely peripheral side effects, and sugar pills. But even then, if the antidepressant did better than the other 3 groups, a die-hard skeptic could say that maybe it just more effectively causing non-specific sedation, or blunting, or whatever, than the Valium. Ultimately, a randomized controlled trial can never prove that a psychotropic drug has a specific as opposed to a non-specific effect.So where do we stand? Does that mean we don't know what drugs do? No - unless we're some cloistered soul who only reads papers as opposed to talking to people, reading subjective reports, or taking drugs themselves. I know what alcohol does, not because I've read papers about it, but because I've drunk it. I've also been depressed and taken antidepressants, and for what it's worth, in my experience, some of the drugs currently marketed as antidepressants do have a specific anti-depression effect, although others don't. Overall, though, my view is that we know surprisingly little about what antidepressants actually do.Perlis RH, Ostacher M, Fava M, N...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, the organizers themselves decided at 7:50 p.m. to cancel the event and so informed the University's Protection Services staff on site. At that time, a crowd of about one thousand people had peacefully gathered at Marion Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So…no word of violence at all, just a peaceful protest. &lt;b&gt;Ann Coulter simply chickened out&lt;/b&gt;, and the decision was entirely hers and the organizations that invited her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind, there was no infringement of open discussion here, just another example of right wing cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait — it gets worse. Here&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://communities.canada.com/OTTAWACITIZEN/blogs/katzenjammer/archive/2010/03/25/cue-the-violins.aspx"&gt;Ann Coulter's description of the event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police called off my speech when the auditorium was surrounded by thousands of rioting liberals -- screaming, blocking the entrance, throwing tables, demanding that my books be burned, and finally setting off the fire alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know. Setting off a fire alarm after that chaos of rioting, screaming liberals sounds a bit anticlimactic, you know. As that link also reveals, most of the people in that mob were her fans, politely lined up to attend her lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know it wasn&amp;#39;t the police who shut down the talk — it was the organizers. Her people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the time when there are no children squeaking in the yard. No sound of breakfast being made. No party banging on down the street and the television isn’t blaring the most recent reality-tv phenomenon must-watch. There’s not even a peep from a bird or a car horn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not heading into work or answering the phone. Who’d be talking at this hour anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep good company. It appears to me that women in podcasting are no strangers to the quiet, tiny hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mur Lafferty and Robyn ‘Swoopy’ McCarthy are pioneers in the field of podcasting, let alone being female podcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podcasting involves  digital media files (either audio or video) being released episodically and often downloaded through the internet. While the mode of delivery differs, with some being released on iTunes or on other means like direct download or streaming, they provide listeners and viewers with a range of genres to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From science fiction, to advice on writing skills to contemporary issues and science news, issues relevant to me as a technology-keen female and gaining advice on how to be confident about using technology and becoming a podcaster – essentially, I enjoy listening to Mur and Swoopy on my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Mur Lafferty started back in 2004 and pretty much hasn’t stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her first podcast, &lt;a href="http://www.geekfuactiongrip.com/"&gt;Geek Fu Action Grip&lt;/a&gt;, contained ramblings about the geek lifestyle as well as original essays and ran from 2004-2007. Her award-winning novella series, “&lt;a href="http://www.heavennovel.com/"&gt;Heaven&lt;/a&gt;,” wrapped up in late 2009 and spanned five seasons. She started a writing podcast in August, 2005, targeted at people who strive to be writers but are held back by doubts and self-constructed barriers. &lt;a href="http://www.ishouldbewriting.com/"&gt;I Should Be Writing&lt;/a&gt; has proved to be quite popular as well and won a Parsec award in 2007 and a Podcast Peer Award in 2008. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In fall 2007 she podcasted her first full length novel: &lt;a href="http://www.playingforkeepsnovel.com/"&gt;Playing for Keeps&lt;/a&gt;, which was released in print by Swarm Press in August 2008, and won the 2008 Parsec Award for Best Novel and reached #1 in Science Fiction on Amazon.com. She helped found and edit the podcast &lt;a href="http://pseudopod.org/"&gt;Pseudopod&lt;/a&gt; and released her first audio drama, The Takeover, in 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, where else do you find someone who talks about trying to juggle it ALL by &lt;a href="http://murverse.com/2010/03/24/my-house-is-very-messy/"&gt;‘just trying to get the right mindset to clean my damn house’&lt;/a&gt; and in doing so refers to gaming analogies? More than once I’ve noticed her mention on Twitter how the early hours are a solution to continuing her amazing output, being a mother and still finding time for #pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, just go subscribe to her shows and reflect upon how one of the  things that we don’t often think about women in technology is that they can be mothers, wives, partners and do that ‘traditional job’ of holding the domestic-world together. Sometimes these women even inventively incorporating both lives to make the experience even better for their audiences – the unique &lt;a href="http://murverse.com/2010/03/05/princess-scientist%E2%80%99s-book-club-4-%E2%80%93-a-wrinkle-in-time-and-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid/"&gt;Princess Scientist podcast&lt;/a&gt; features her daughter and husband, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Picture-8.png" alt="" width="176" height="224"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Robyn ‘Swoopy’ McCarthy of Skepticality is another ‘veteran’ of the genre. However, she’s more of the factual-sort, the critical-thinking, pro-science, pro-skepticism, hard-yards, where the hell does she get the time to read all of those, I should have got a copy of that one by now or I’ll never be as good an interviewer, unless I start stepping up my game like she does… sort of podcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com"&gt;Skeptic.com&lt;/a&gt; are very lucky to have her on their side when it comes to producing quality material in the name of rationalism and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Co-host Swoopy is skeptical of many things, but mostly Derek. Previously her Skepticality contributions included the fun stuff like &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Whimsicality&lt;/span&gt;, and all of the music that is featured on the show. After her accomplished coup d’ état of 2006, Swoopy became a one woman podcasting machine and now does all the writing, most of the research and all of the editing and post-production on the program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swoopy is the Co-Director of &lt;a href="http://www.skeptrack.org/"&gt;Skeptrack&lt;/a&gt;, a programming track devoted to skepticism at &lt;a href="http://www.dragoncon.org/"&gt;Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt; (the world’s largest culture convention) which is held in Atlanta, Georgia every Labor Day weekend. Additionally, she is also the Director of the&lt;a href="http://www.dragon-pod.com/"&gt; Podcasting: Now and Beyond&lt;/a&gt; programming track, also at Dragon*Con.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swoopy is also the namesake for the asteroid &lt;strong&gt;106537 McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt;,  in honor of how she &lt;em&gt;“pioneered the new media of podcasting and put it to service for skeptical thinking.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, just go subscribe to her show &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com"&gt;Skepticality&lt;/a&gt; and reflect upon how one of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things that we don’t often think about women in technology, is how they can be the one holding the fort together when there’s professional and personal tragedy. In her case, it was the time-period in 2006 where her partner Derek was recovering from a stroke – but still, the ’show must go on’. Skepticality has gone on and has inspired a great many other female skeptic podcasters too with her resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I do know what will happen to me when I die. I’m going to medical school, just like my Jewish mother always wanted me to do.  I’ll use my body parts to their fullest when I’m alive, but I hope others will be able to take advantage of them when I die.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes from a terrific piece Herb wrote &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/herb_silverman/2010/03/heaven_on_earth_1.html"&gt;in response to the question&lt;/a&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;What is your vision of heaven?&lt;/em&gt;” at On Faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a child, asking heaven and hell questions probably contributed to my journey that led to atheism. I used to wonder whether I could be happy in heaven knowing that some of my friends would be suffering in hell. I also wondered if I would have free will in heaven, as I assumed I had on Earth. If so, could I sin in heaven and be sent to hell? If not, would I really be &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, or just a robot without free will?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I couldn’t believe that belief mattered more than behavior. So perhaps because of my mathematical bent, I wondered how much better the worst person in heaven would be than the best person in hell. The only answers I received were “God knows,” which is synonymous with, “I don’t know.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last part is interesting.  If Heaven existed, &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; would have to be the “worst person” there, right?  What would that person be like…?  And the “best person” in Hell?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcripts to follow! &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 Transcript (Thanks to Marilove!):&lt;br&gt;
So here we are, day two of the apple experiment, and as promised I will be recording exactly what I am saying to the apples, as I want this entire process to be open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, on that note, I’ve received a few very helpful comments from people.  This is kind of like the peer-review process, where people suggest additional controls that I can put on the experiment so that I can make sure it is as well done and scientific as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those controls is that I sterilize the knife next time because if there’s microbe on half the knife, then that can get on half the apple, but then not the other half.  Had I not eaten one of the quarters, I could have held that back as a control, and microbes from the knife wouldn’t have been as a big of a deal.  But since I didn’t … I was very hungry … damn you peanut butter!  Yeah, that’s an additional control that might need to be put into place next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there will be a next time!  At the end of this week, I’m going to do the experiment again, with all the controls you guys suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s one.  Another person suggested that I speak to the apples out of the line of hearing of the other apples.  I’m not sure how sensitive apple’s ears are, but I’m going to take this into consideration and privately convey my emotions to each of the apples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thanks for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one came from a believer on Nicky’s facebook page.  A believer suggested that having mustaches instead of love and hate might be a bit of a problem, in that it’s too fun, so that even the hate apple, despite being lambasted every day, might still be in a good mood, because it’s got a comedy mustache on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will address that. in the next study I do, there will be no mustaches.  That said, i really did take this into account.  Because, as you can see, on the jars, the “hate apple” has a villain mustache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, take a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[on hate apple]:  If that’s not the mustache of a villain, I don’t know what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[on love apple]:  And I think that is is like a hero mustache.  That’s the type of mustache a sheriff might have, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[on apple of indifference]:  And the neutral mustache, I just see as an old man, maybe a kindly old gentleman who you don’t really pay much attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I did consider that when choosing the mustaches.  But, I’ll take this into consideration, and next time around, no mustaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Camera goes into next room, with the hate apple)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I’m in the next room now, where the other apples hopefully can’t hear me.  so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Starts talking to the hate apple]  “Hate apple, there is no easy way to see this, but frankly, you’re fat.  I would suggest that you do a bit more dehydrating before being seen in public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To the love apple]  “Hey love apple.  Baby, you lookin’ so fine today. I would totally hit that. Also, I just want to say that for an apple, you seem remarkably intelligent.  I don’t know what it is.  Maybe it’s just the look in your skin.  Yeah, mega hot.  Love you babe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To the apple of indifference]  “Meh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for day two.  Thanks to everyone for your suggestions, please keep them coming, and I look forward to seeing your own experiments and now they turn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;

Who they are doesn't really matter, they're just one of many provincial firms of solicitors in the UK. They were engaged by Principle Healthcare, a firm selling vitamin pills, motto: &lt;em&gt;"Our reputation is your insurance."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Principle Healthcare's reputation, another blogger and regular guest writer on The Lay Scientist, &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/users/james-cole"&gt;James Cole&lt;/a&gt;, spotted some claims on their website one day that seemed to be a bit dodgy. He decided to do some investigating, and he reported his findings to the MHRA, and to Trading Standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They weren't very pleased with Principle Healthcare. The MHRA said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a bit of background. Galaxies are filled with hydrogen gas, and that gas is a major component of the clouds that collapse to form stars. When that happens, the hot stars ionize the gas: the flood of ultraviolet light strips the electron away from the proton, freeing both. If the electron gets near the proton again, they can recombine. Because of quantum mechanics, the electron can only exists in certain &lt;em&gt;energy states&lt;/em&gt;, which are a bit like steps in a staircase. You can jump from the third step down to the second, but there is no second-and-a-halfth step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is with electrons. It used to be taught that this levels were like orbits, but that’s not a great analogy; the staircase is better. So if the electron is on the second level and drops to the first, it gives off energy in the form of light (just like when you step down you lose a bit of energy too, and it takes energy to go up a step). For the 2 to 1 step in hydrogen, the photon emitted is in the ultraviolet, and has a special name: Lyman alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionized hydrogen gas clouds tend to blast out lots of Lyman alpha. This makes it a good way to search for distant star forming regions; just look for that wonderful wavelength of light associated with the 2 – 1 transition of hydrogen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, we know that when the Universe was young, about a quarter the age it is now, star formation was going on at a much higher rate on average than it does now. So astronomers figured, hey, why not do searches for distant galaxies using Lyman alpha? They should pump it out, and make them easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they looked. And to their surprise, they only found about 10% of the galaxies they predicted they should! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a problem for some time. But it’s not anymore: &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1013/"&gt;a recent experiment by astronomers&lt;/a&gt; shows that the galaxies are there, but they’re hidden!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they did is look in one part of the sky, using &lt;a href="http://www.stsci.edu/science/goods/"&gt;the GOODS South field&lt;/a&gt; (part of which is pictured above), trying to find Lyman alpha emitting galaxies. Then they looked at the same region, but looked instead for &lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt; alpha, the line emitted when an electron jumps down from the third energy level to the second. &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso1013/eso1013.pdf"&gt;And guess what they found&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;tons of galaxies!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, they surmised, is that the galaxies are actually there and emitting Lyman alpha. But before that ultraviolet light can get out of one of those galaxies, it gets reabsorbed by gas inside the galaxy itself. We never see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But H alpha can more easily escape the galaxies once it’s produced. For one thing, it’s red light, and that can penetrate the gas and dust better than the ultraviolet Lyman alpha light can. There are other more complicated reasons as well, but the point is, the galaxies were simply hidden from us before, but not anymore. By extrapolating their results, it looks like they found 90% of the distant Universe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="darkmatter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I’ll note: this has nothing to do with dark matter. As it happens, 90% of the matter in the Universe is in a form that emits no light, but affects other matter through gravity. We know it exists, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/01/07/aas-report-2-dark-matter-and-large-scale-structure/"&gt;you can find out why here&lt;/a&gt;. We know it exists locally, in nearby galaxies and clusters of galaxies, too. This new result doesn’t affect that, since the now un-hidden galaxies are very far away, like many &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; of light years away. They can’t possibly affect nearby galaxies, so they don’t account for dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this study. It’s a great application of simple logic, though it wasn’t so simple to do: they had to use a lot of time on a monster 8 meter telescope to do it! But they were able to answer a question that has been around for some time, and it really does look like they’ve solved it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as always, it makes me wonder what else is lurking out there in space, hidden but for a leap of logic and technology that will allow us to unveil it. Science is all about thinking around problems, and peeking into dusty corners. Sometimes the most interesting things are found there… including, in this case, the vast majority of the Universe!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269456349401"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/civility_incivility.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0c1b3c67c485d7b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Republicans"/><title type="html">Civility?

&lt;p&gt;Creative manipulation of lexical and grammatical constructions is another way to express ideas that are not permitted under the harsh social controls imposed by the government.  This is evident from the fact that the "character of the year" in China for 2009 is &lt;em&gt;bèi&lt;/em&gt; 被.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What is so great and powerful about this unprepossessing character &lt;em&gt;bèi&lt;/em&gt; 被?  As a noun &lt;em&gt;bèi&lt;/em&gt; can mean "quilt" or "cover."  As a &lt;em&gt;jiècí&lt;/em&gt; 介詞 ("preposition"), &lt;em&gt;bèi&lt;/em&gt; is used in a passive sentence to introduce the doer of the action:  &lt;em&gt;tā bèi quántǐ dǎngyuán píngxǔan wéi zhǔxí&lt;/em&gt; 他被全體黨員評選為主席 ("He was elected by all of the party members as chairman.")  Before verbs, &lt;em&gt;bèi&lt;/em&gt; is used to indicate passive voice:  &lt;em&gt;bèi yāpò&lt;/em&gt; 被壓迫 ("be oppressed").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, it has become fashionable to use the passive voice with verbs that don't normally allow it and in situations that seem ludicrous.  One of the most celebrated examples is &lt;em&gt;bèi zìshā&lt;/em&gt; 被自殺 ("be suicided"), with the implication that someone was beaten to death, but the authorities made it look as though he had committed suicide.  Once coined, &lt;em&gt;bèi zìshā&lt;/em&gt; spread like wildfire, so that it wasn't long before it merited its own entry in online dictionaries and encyclopedias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel application of the adversative passive is quite versatile.  Here are some other common, but telling, examples (English translations only):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. employmented:  turned into a false employment statistic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. represented:  misrepresented without consent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. invited to tea:  questioned by police, usually on political matters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. high-speed railroaded:  forced to buy expensive high-speed rail tickets because ordinary train tickets are not available&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. harmonized:  censored (this must be particularly galling to the party elders, since &lt;em&gt;héxié&lt;/em&gt; 和諧 ["harmoniousness"], with all of its clarion Confucian resonances, is President-Chairman-General Secretary Hu Jintao's pet platitude)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. volunteered:  forced to volunteer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specific examples of the application of these clever usages may be found &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124913011"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2010-02/16/c_13176690.htm"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adversative passive is a prominent areal feature of Southeast Asian languages, but I wonder whether it has been used anywhere else in the world in such a systematic manner to express resistance against government policies as it has come to be in present-day China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, it is worth noting that the &lt;a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/life/offbeat/2009/11/17/233135/Unfriend-is.htm"&gt;English word of the year for 2009&lt;/a&gt; is "&lt;a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/oxford-english-dictionary-unfriend/14737/"&gt;unfriend&lt;/a&gt;."  Like the ironic adversative passive in Chinese, it was generated by powerful Internet forces, just as were the other runners-up for English word of the year:  "netbook" and "sexting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Chinese netizens cannot experience the thrill of "unfriending" someone, since Facebook and other similar social networking services are blocked in the PRC.  Still, with Google moving to a freer Hong Kong, and with the abundant linguistic capabilities of Chinese netizens themselves, we can be sure that there will be new ways to circumvent the Great Chinese Firewall, which, after all, is only a paper tiger.&lt;/p&gt;

I also went fully vegetarian for the month of January, but I'm back onto the meat now.  Still, it was probably good to do it for a month, just to get me into the swing of things with cooking vegetarian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to say, this has been incredibly worthwhile.  I have worked with ingredients I had never even tasted before, prepared dishes I'd never done before, and it's pushed my culinary creativity quite a bit.  Still, I would never be willing to give up preparing meat forever -- as I mused in one of my earlier posts on the subject, there is &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; in the world of vegetarianism that is anything like the experience of braising a tough fatty piece of meat full of connective tissue until it becomes a magically tender and delicious indulgence, and there are plenty of other examples like that of culinary adventures that are just irreplaceable.  But being restricted for awhile has set me off on all sorts of &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; culinary adventures, and it's been exciting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came to the conclusion early on that the burgeoning world of vegan cooking (I don't think it really &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegan#History"&gt;existed prior to the 20th century&lt;/a&gt;) is in many ways deserving of being called a "cuisine" in its own right.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;What makes a cuisine?  Well, certainly a multi-century history helps, but I'm not sure it is a requirement.  Rather, I think a cuisine is defined by  ingredients and techniques that are unique (or at least uniquely emphasized) apart from other cuisines, and by signature dishes or types of dishes.  The use of lemongrass as an ingredient immediately calls to mind Thai and other Southeast Asian cuisines.  Sauces based on the technique of emulsifying fat with eggs or other ingredients can only trace their lineage to traditional French cooking.  And who else would call a dish "bangers and mash" except the British?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By these criteria, vegan food just about fits.  It certainly fits the "unique ingredients" criterion.  Tempeh might evoke memories of home for those who hail from Indonesia, but for most of us it calls to mind images of crunchy hippies at an organic co-op.  And modern inventions like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textured_vegetable_protein"&gt;TVP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorn"&gt;Quorn&lt;/a&gt; (a fascinating ingredient I intend to write a separate post about later) don't even exist in other cuisines.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "unique techniques" criterion is more problematic, although the strong emphasis on substitution and imitation forces new twists on older techniques.  For instance, my &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/#sausage"&gt;tempeh "Italian sausage"&lt;/a&gt; recipe below can not rightly be called a new technique, but employing the flavor profile of Italian sausage as a marinade/sauce rather than for seasoning meat is somewhat of a new twist, I think.  Vegans eschewing of milk and dairy forces the development of alternatives for when those ingredients are used for their prolific chemical qualities, e.g. the use of flour as a binder in vegan burgers when a non-vegan recipe might use an egg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not entirely qualified to talk about "signature dishes", as I am pretty new to vegetarian cuisine, and I'm doing a lot of figuring-it-out-for-myself as I go along.  Certainly, veggies burgers have become an entire genre unto themselves, ranging from the &lt;a href="http://www.morningstarfarms.com/products.aspx?coid=23%7C59%7C59&amp;amp;family=363%7C634%7C675"&gt;mass-produced and passable&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/thekitchn/restaurant-reproductions/restaurant-reproduction-bestever-veggie-burgers-from-northstar-cafe-096967"&gt;truly inspired&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=buffalo+tempeh"&gt;Buffalo tempeh is a popular dish&lt;/a&gt;, and with good reason -- it tastes damn good.  (Please don't call it "Vegetarian 'chicken wings'", though... it doesn't taste like Buffalo chicken, it tastes like Buffalo tempeh, and there's nothing wrong with that!)  I'm sure there are many other signature vegetarian/vegan dishes that I am not aware of or not thinking of off the top of my head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of which brings me to an idea:  "Vegan" fusion.  Why not take the ingredients and techniques that define vegan cuisine, and mix them up with other cuisines without regard to the conventional restrictions of veganism or vegetarianism?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My current cooking practices already hint at this, in that I use vegan recipes but "unsubstitute" certain ingredients based on the looser dietary restrictions in our household (e.g. Buffalo tempeh is usually thought of as a vegan thing, but I use butter in the sauce and often either milk or eggs depending on how I am doing the breading).  But I think it could be taken so much further.  Can vegan cuisine's vast experience with imitation inform clever new twists on meat dishes?  Could TVP be used in a non-vegetarian context to establish a certain unique flavor or texture?  What kind of symphony of ingredients could be composed if one were free to make a "bacon veggie burger"?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, all reflecting out of the way, here's a couple of recipes I've come up with that really impress:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="sausage"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tempeh Italian "Sausage"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1-2 Tbsp fennel seed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1-2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil (calibrate for healthy vs. tasty)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 cloves minced garlic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 tsp crushed red pepper&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 tsp liquid smoke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 package of tempeh, crumbled (not sliced) into bits about 1/4" in diameter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I'm still refining this one, so take the amounts and the technique with a heavy helping of salt (not literally please!).  Place fennel seed in skillet over medium heat and toast, tossing fennel seed occasionally, until aromatic.  Add extra virgin olive oil, garlic, and crushed red pepper, salt gently, and adjust heat so that garlic and fennel seed are just cooking but not burning.  Cook for 5 minutes or so until flavors start to combine.  Add liquid smoke, then tempeh, and combine well.  Cook another 5 minutes or so and then remove all contents from skillet into a small bowl.  Separate tempeh out from the other ingredients (some of the sauce will adhere to the tempeh -- this is a good thing!) and return to skillet.  Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until tempeh starts to brown and superficially resemble little bits of poultry sausage.  Return tempeh to bowl with other ingredients, stir to combine, and let it marinate until you are ready to use it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can use this on pizza, in pasta, or wherever.  Unfortunately, the seasonings -- especially the fennel seed -- don't penetrate the tempeh very well, so you need to put some of the sauce into your dish as well as the tempeh itself.  Alternatively, it might be possible to crumble the tempeh very finely in a food processor, and then before returning it to the skillet for browning, use egg as a binder and form it into the desired shape.  That way you could make patties or whatever, and the seasonings would be well-distributed throughout... but I haven't tried this yet, so &lt;i&gt;caveat emptor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One creative use I came up with for it is to put it in sushi, along with a little bit of diced sun-dried tomato and crumbled feta.  Yes, &lt;b&gt;tempeh Italian "sausage" sushi&lt;/b&gt;!  For real!  Everyone is always extremely skeptical, but then they try it and are amazed.  I usually coat my sushi with toasted sesame seeds, but for the "sausage" sushi, I toast an extra teaspoon or so of fennel seed and then crush it well, and then I dust the outside of the roll with a little bit of that instead of sesame seeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of wacky vegetarian sushi:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="sushi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buffalo tempeh sushi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Tbsp butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frank's Red Hot to taste&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dash of rice wine vinegar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cayenne pepper (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Half a celery stalk, very thinly sliced into thin ~4" long sticks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 package of tempeh, sliced into ~1/4" wide ~4" long sticks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blue cheese dressing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sushi rice (whatever recipe you use) and nori&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup flour&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 can or bottle of beer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enough vegetable oil to fill a deep skillet or Dutch oven to at least 1" deep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Melt butter in microwave in small microwave-safe bowl.  Whisk in Frank's Red Hot until it looks and tastes like Buffalo sauce.  Add the tiniest dash of rice wine vinegar.  If you want it extra spicy, add cayenne pepper to taste.  Construct a maki roll filled with tempeh, celery stalks, and a drizzle of the Buffalo sauce and a drizzle of the blue cheese dressing (maybe ~1/2 Tbsp each).  Cut roll in half.  (Do not slice it yet!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Place flour in a shallow bowl.  Open can or bottle of beer, and add enough beer to the flour so that it forms a nice beer batter.  Drink the rest of the beer.  &lt;i&gt;Do not omit the previous step!&lt;/i&gt;  Heat vegetable oil in deep skillet or Dutch oven until it gets to frying temperature, about 375 degrees.  If you don't have a candy thermometer, you can tell it's ready when flicking a drop of water in it is likely to get your arm burned by splashing hot oil (if you remembered to drink the rest of the beer like I told you, this seems like a great idea and is not too painful).  Dip the roll halfs in the batter, shake off any excess, and then deep fry them until golden brown, turning once, doing the halfs one at a time if you are working in a small-ish skillet so that the oil temperature doesn't drop too much.  Place remaining Buffalo sauce and roll halfs in container with sealable lid and shake until roll halfs are well-coated.  Slice the roll halfs as you would ordinary maki sushi.  Arrange the roll on serving platter and drizzle a tiny amount of blue cheese dressing over the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to make this one vegan, there are plenty of recipes on the web for making Buffalo sauce without the butter (use oil for the main fat, but there are other tweaks that help get the consistency right), and you can omit the blue cheese altogether without completely destroying the dish.  But it's much better with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sorry to post two uber-unhealthy recipes both with Buffalo sauce, but this last one was so stunning in its verisimilitude of the real thing that I need to post it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vegetarian Buffalo "Chicken" Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Tbsp butter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frank's Red Hot to taste&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dash of rice wine vinegar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cayenne pepper (optional)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 Quorn cutlets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 egg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup Panko bread crumbs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enough vegetable oil to fill a deep skillet or Dutch oven to at least 1/2" deep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pizza crust (purchased, or made according to your favorite recipe)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blue cheese dressing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/3 lb or so of mozzarella, shredded&lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/#shred"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup chopped red onion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Preheat oven to 450 degrees or whatever temperature you use to cook your pizza crust.  Prepare Buffalo sauce and then heat oil as per &lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/#sushi"&gt;previous recipe&lt;/a&gt; (since you are not doing a beer batter for this one and so might be completely sober, using a thermometer is strongly recommended).  Beat egg well.  Place Panko bread crumbs in shallow bowl or on plate.  Dip frozen Quorn cutlets in egg, then place in bread crumbs and turn to coat.  Fry breaded cutlets until golden-brown, turning once, doing them one at a time if you are using a small-ish skillet.  Reserve about 1 Tbsp or so of the Buffalo sauce, and place the rest of the sauce and the fried breaded cutlets in a sealable container and shake until well-coated.  Slice cutlets into 1/2" chunks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cover crust with thin layer of blue cheese dressing.  Scatter Quorn chunks over dressing, then cover with shredded mozzarella.  Top with red onions.  Place pizza on center rack (or better yet, on a preheated pizza stone if you have one) and cook until cheese is melted and crust is cooked through, about 10-15 minutes.  Remove from oven and drizzle reserved Buffalo sauce over the top.  Cut into slices and serve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="shred"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Please, please, please buy a block of mozzarella and shred it yourself.  It's cheaper, it tastes way better, and it takes like thirty seconds.  If you don't have a box grater, get one.  Seriously.  The only possible excuse for using pre-shredded cheese is if you are cooking for a boatload of people, so that the shredding actually does become time-consuming.  Otherwise, please, shred it yourself!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-2602381372630231630?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269455362816"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/tea_party_activists_promise_to.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/99b96e0ecaadcbac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Michele Bachmann"/><title type="html">Tea Party Activists Promise to  Shoot Those who Disagree With Them</title><published>2010-03-24T19:14:22Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T19:14:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/keeTfQ0QqrU/tea_party_activists_promise_to.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/tea_party_activists_promise_to.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Tea Party activists have gathered on Capitol Hill today for a "Code Red" rally against health care reform. ....

Or it may be yet another example of how hard it is to figure where one species stops and another begins–even when one of those species is our own. Big news, perhaps, or ambiguous news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; today, &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/37/13575.full"&gt;Svante Paabo&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues published a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08976"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; describing their work in a place known as the Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. There are lots of hominid bones and tools indicating people lived in the cave, off and on, for 125,000 years. There’s good evidence of &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; in the region for at least 40,000 years, and &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/full/nature06193.html"&gt;Paabo and his colleagues have also isolated 30,000-year old DNA from Siberian sites that is similar to the DNA from Neanderthals in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists succeeded in fishing out human-like DNA from a pinky bone found in Denisova, and so far they’ve sequenced its mitochondrial DNA–that is, the DNA that is housed in mitochondria, sausage-shaped, fuel-producing structures in our cells. The majority of our DNA, which sits in the nucleus of cells, comes from both our mother and father. But mitochondrial DNA all comes from Mom. When the scientists compared the pinky DNA to DNA of humans and Neanderthals, they got something of a shock. If you line up the mitochondrial DNA from any given living human to any other living human, you might expect to find a few dozen points at which they are different. Compare human mtDNA to Neanderthal DNA, and you’ll find about 200 differences. But when the scientists compared the Denisova DNA to a group of human mitochondrial genomes, they found nearly 400 differences. In other words, their DNA was about twice as different from ours than Neanderthal DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists then used the DNA to draw a family tree. Here’s the figure from the paper, which you can also see &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/03/full-xwoman-tree.png"&gt;here for full-size viewing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/03/full-xwoman-tree600.png"&gt;&lt;img title="full xwoman tree600" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/03/full-xwoman-tree600.png" alt="full xwoman tree600" width="600" height="394"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Denisova mitochondrial DNA has been passed down, mother to child, on a lineage of hominids that’s separate from the one that produced mitochondria in Neanderthals and in living humans. Paabo and his colleagues estimated the age of common ancestor from which all the mitochondria evolved, based on the mutations in each branch. They concluded that common ancestor lived 1 million years ago. Below is a simple tree that shows the timing more clearly, from an accompanying commentary in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/03/simple-xwoman-tree.png"&gt;&lt;img title="simple xwoman tree" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/03/simple-xwoman-tree.png" alt="simple xwoman tree" width="440" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;No matter how you slice it, this is very exciting. All the mitochondrial DNA from living humans is believed to date back just 150,ooo years. That doesn’t mean that we all descend from a single “Eve.” There were other woman around at the time, and they passed down their own mitochondria. But those lineages eventually hit dead ends. In some cases, women only had sons. In others, they never had children. Eventually, all the mitochondrial DNA in the human population could be traced to only one of the women alive at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA also shares a relatively recent common ancestor of its own–probably thanks to the same process. And now, for the first time, scientists have found hominid mitochondrial DNA that comes from a far more ancient split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So–how to explain this? A couple possibilities present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The DNA belongs to a species of hominid that’s neither human nor Neanderthal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most interesting, most science-fictionish possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our hominid ancestors evolved into upright apes in Africa some six million years ago. By about 1.9 million years ago, some of those hominids had made their way out of Africa and strolled all the way to Indonesia. They go by the name of &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;, and they stuck around Asia for quite a long time–some would argue they were still around 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals appear to have evolved from another wave out of Africa, which spread to Europe and Siberia several hundred thousand years ago. Meanwhile, our own ancestors appear to have stayed put in Africa. The oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans come from Africa 200,000 years ago, for example, and studies on human DNA find that African lineages are the oldest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Denisova DNA split too recently from our own to have been carried by &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, the first globe-trotting hominids. But paleoanthropologists have found a fair number of other hominid fossils in Europe and Asia that might belong to more recent waves out of Africa. (&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v452/n7186/full/nature06815.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is a report on hominids in Europe 1.2 million years ago.) So perhaps there was at least one other wave aside from &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, the expansion of Neanderthals, and the spread of modern humans. If that’s true, this new discovery also means that this wave produced a long lineage of hominids that survived long enough to live alongside humans. We coexisted with yet another species of hominid–along with Neanderthals, &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, and those lovable hobbits, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis"&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;/em&gt;for thousands of years. Our current solitude is a recent fluke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If #1 turns out to be true, then this DNA deserves a species name of its own. But for now, Paabo and his colleagues have refrained from giving it one. Instead, they’ve nicknamed the source of the DNA “X-woman.” Why the reticence? Probably because of possibility #2…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. The DNA comes from the finger of a Neanderthal or a human–thanks to a love that dare not speak its name&lt;/strong&gt;. Imagine, if you will, that an early Neanderthal male takes a morning constitutional in search of woolly rhinos when, gadzooks, he meets up with a fetching X-woman hominid. For whatever reason, the two of them decide to have an interspecies tryst, and X-woman gets pregnant. She gives birth to a girl carrying Neanderthal and X-woman DNA in her nucleus–and nothing but X-woman DNA in her mitochondria. Somehow this girl becomes a part of Neanderthal society; she has Neanderthal children of her own, and they continue to carry the X-woman mitochondrial DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that in every generation, nuclear DNA gets mixed up. Half of the DNA a child carries in the nucleus comes from its father, half from its mother. And with the generation of new eggs and sperm, chromosomes from each parent get chopped up and shuffled back into new combinations. So over generations, the X-woman DNA might gradually dwindle away from the Neanderthal gene pool–but some Neanderthals might still carry X-woman mitochondria, handed down from mother to daughter to grand-daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It’s also possible that the interbreeding male in this scenario was a human–although just in terms of timing, that’s less likely, since Neanderthals were out of Africa sooner than we were.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason to take this possibility seriously is the fact that other primate species regularly mix up their DNA in just this way. &lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/32"&gt;Mongoose lemurs expanded into the range of brown lemurs,&lt;/a&gt; for example, and mitochondrial DNA ended up jumping the species barrier. In many cases, the species were separated by a million years or so, just like the Denisov DNA and human/Neanderthal DNA. (This is why &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crvi.2009.10.003"&gt;it’s hard to use DNA-barcoding to tell closely related primates apart&lt;/a&gt;.) Another reason to take this possibility serious is lies in our own genomes. Some scientists have made &lt;a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/8/1823"&gt;a forceful case&lt;/a&gt; for the presence of ancient non-human DNA in the gene pool of living humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even if this scenario turned out to be right, it would mean that a previously unknown X-woman hominid line expanded out of Africa and lived in Asia until relatively recently. Whether that lineage could be rightly considered a separate species of its own is tricky. (For more on that trickiness, &lt;a href="http://carlzimmer.com/articles/2008.php?subaction=showfull&amp;amp;id=1212035493&amp;amp;archive=&amp;amp;start_from=&amp;amp;ucat=11&amp;amp;"&gt;see my article, “What is a Species?”&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine other possible interpretations, but I’m not sure how plausible they really are. I’ve sent out some queries to some experts, and will add anything interesting I get back &lt;em&gt;[Update: See the end of the post]&lt;/em&gt;. Fortunately, it may be possible to rule some possibilities out in just a few months. Paabo and company are busily churning out the sequence of the nuclear DNA from the Denisova pinky. It’s conceivable that the nuclear DNA will be a lot more like human DNA, or a lot more like Neanderthal DNA–making it likely that the fossil belongs to a hybrid. But if the nuclear DNA is just as exotic as the mitochondria, then perhaps the finger bone really does belong to a distinct species that lived 40,000 years ago–a species, it’s worth pointing out, that left its bones behind in the same layer of sediment where Russian scientists have dug up tools and ornaments made of stone and antler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibility of a highly intelligent Siberian Other will have to dance in our heads until more studies come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:BK3C3MBsaNdvyM:http://johnhawks.net/graphics/hawks-red-chair-2008-small-bw.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="116"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;After I posted this, the paleoanthropologist John Hawks offers &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/neandertals/neandertal_dna/denisova-krause-2010.html"&gt;an alternative explanation&lt;/a&gt; on his blog. I followed up with a few questions via email, and based on his post and his reply, here’s my quick distillation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe the X-woman was not a separate species at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind back the clock to a million years ago. In Africa, there’s a population of hominids that will eventually give rise to Neanderthals and humans. The Neanderthal lineage expands out across Europe and Asia. They take with them a wide diversity of mitochondria. Most of the studies on Neanderthal DNA have focused on European Neanderthals–and have thus only captured a limited sample of that diversity. Now, in Siberia, Paabo and his colleagues have moved so far from the areas they had studied before that they’re finally getting to other branches of Neanderthal mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, Neanderthals play a role similar to that of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/02/17/full-spectrum-genomes/"&gt;Africans in the diversity of living humans&lt;/a&gt;. In Africa, you can find people with genes belonging to very old lineages. The Khoisan bushmen of southern Africa, for example, have genes that branched off from all other human lineages long ago. In other words, the genes of other Africans share a closer ancestor with genes from people out of Africa. Likewise, some Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA is more like human DNA than it is to the Neanderthal DNA found in the Denisova pinky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/27/10: Time to go Borges: an update within an update!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The Atavism (which has already displayed great skills in visualization by &lt;a href="http://theatavism.blogspot.com/2010/03/illustrating-carl-zimmers-readers.html"&gt;illustrating my recent reader survey&lt;/a&gt;) whipped together &lt;a href="http://theatavism.blogspot.com/2010/03/does-forty-thousand-year-old-finger.html"&gt;a diagram&lt;/a&gt; that gets this concept across nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v387/science_boy/tubetree_corrected-1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v387/science_boy/tubetree_some_more.png" alt="" width="550" height="302"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll post more replies as they come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.cmpg.iee.unibe.ch/unibe/philnat/biology/zoologie/cmpg/content/e7023/e7527/e7550/e7551/Lorosansdavo-tiny_eng.jpg" alt="" width="106" height="147"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 3/25/10 10:15 am:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I also got in touch with &lt;a href="http://cmpg.iee.unibe.ch/content/about_us/researchers/laurent_excoffier/index_eng.html"&gt;Laurent Excoffier&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, who has published models of human evolution indicating that there has been little, if any interbreeding between our own lineage and Neanderthals or other hominids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Excoffier has argued that some genes that have been claimed to have entered our lineage through interbreeding were actually already present in ancient African human populations. I wondered if the mitochondrial DNA in the Denisova pinky might just be from an old human, not a separate species. Excoffier was skeptical:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This seems relatively unlikely, since it is difficult to understand why this mtDNA lineage would not have been preserved in Africa. Of course some otherwise rare mutations (or DNA sequences) can surf to higher frequencies during range expansions, and this could potentially explain why it could be seen outside Africa and not within Africa. But if that was the case, then it would be difficult to understand why this once frequent sequence would then have disappeared. So, I would thus consider this hypothesis as very unlikely.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then asked if he thought the best explanation for this DNA was that it came from a separate species, or that it spread from a separate species into Neanderthals or humans through interbreeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If this sequence is really true (not an artefact from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0vGrNjpyA8&amp;amp;feature=youtube_gdata"&gt;next-gen sequencing&lt;/a&gt;) and if there was no contamination, then a more plausible explanation would be that this sequence comes from a divergent Homo species, as claimed by the authors of the paper.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is indeed plausible that some non-modern homo or non-Neanderthals roamed in Asia before modern humans spread there, and this sequence could well belong to one of them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The interesting point for me is that if this sequence is representative of, say, erectus mtDNA diversity in Asia 40-60,000 years ago, then it means that  some divergent erectus were there when modern humans expanded into that region, and that did NOT hybridize with them, or at least not enough to be introgressed by them during their expansion (which is the expectation when hybridization can occur between a local and an invading species).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s a vote for possibility #1.&lt;/p&gt;

Please note that last word, &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; — the Templeton Prize has no connection to that subject. Previous winners include Mother Theresa, Chuck Colson, and Billy Graham — professional frauds. &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5304"&gt;Richard Dawkins has an excellent piece on the subject&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US National Academy of Sciences has brought ignominy on itself by agreeing to host the announcement of the 2010 Templeton Prize (see below). This is exactly the kind of thing Templeton is ceaselessly angling for - recognition among real scientists - and they use their money shamelessly to satisfy their doomed craving for scientific respectability. They tried it on with the Royal Society of London, and they seem to have found a compliant Quisling in the current President, Martin Rees, who, though not religious himself, is a fervent 'believer in belief'. Fortunately, enough Fellows made a stink about it to ensure that the Royal will not flirt with Templeton in future. Now Templeton are apparently trying the same trick with the US National Academy. If you know any officers, or elected members, of the Academy, please write in protest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not my favorite part, though. The Templeton Foundation has invited people to guess who's going to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, let's all guess away to our heart's content. Which leading scientist has done the most to betray science in favour of his imaginary friend? You can rule out the people they'd privately like to honor (such as Intelligent Design "theorists") because that would go against the official policy of courting respectability among scientists. Nowadays they target genuinely good scientists (like Freeman Dyson, winner of the 2000 Templeton Prize), whose subversion provides more bang for the (mega)buck than primarily religious figures who happen also to be scientists. In the early days they didn't even make a pretence of finding a scientist at all: the 1982 winner was the notorious creationist Billy Graham! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Which leading scientist has done the most to betray science in favour of his imaginary friend?" is exactly the criterion they'll use. In that case, the shoo-in would have to be Francis Collins. I wouldn't be surprised if Ken Miller is solidly in the running, though, and if he doesn't get it now, he probably will in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet Michael Ruse lusts after that prize, but his drooling is just a little too obvious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/very_bad_form_nas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/EFVtzcWhDJ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269455058814"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/everyone_knows_that_if_you_wan.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad7065b0de433eeb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Everyone knows that if you want to be beautiful, you have to put the apples in your cheeks</title><published>2010-03-24T17:03:42Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T17:03:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/DQ3Q7g2Sbvg/everyone_knows_that_if_you_wan.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/everyone_knows_that_if_you_wan.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nikki Owen is &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1257939/All-mind-You-really-talk-beautiful-says-expert.html"&gt;"a practitioner of neuro-linguistic programming and TV commentator who is described as Britain's leading charisma expert."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in. You just know she's got to be an utterly &lt;i&gt;astounding&lt;/i&gt; dingbat, and you wouldn't be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, she has made an incredible claim that is testable (that last bit is probably the most astonishing part of it all — these gomers usually run away from anything that can be evaluated as fast as their little legs will take them). Owen says that if you slice an apple in two and talk lovey-dovey to one half, and spiteful meanness to the other, the loved half will stay prettier longer…or the hated half will decay faster. And what&amp;#39;s more, because faces are just like apples, you can make yourself prettier just by sweet-talking yourself in a mirror. Now I think that confidence and cheerfulness can improve your attractiveness, unsurprisingly, but this claim that it is a physical effect that can even impinge on non-sentient vegetables is a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/the-great-apple-experiment/"&gt;Rebecca Watson is taking Nikki Owen on&lt;/a&gt;. She's going to replicate the experiment, with blind assessment and a control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/-aUQzJSpz3s%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is excellent. Some people are complaining about the deviation from the Owen protocol by the addition of mustaches on the jars, but that&amp;#39;s irrelevant, since all of the jars get them — since we know already that mustaches make one youthful, lovely, and sexy, all they&amp;#39;ll do is uniformly preserve all the apple slices for a bit longer. No worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca also has a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=111011592249703&amp;amp;v=info"&gt;facebook page on the experiment&lt;/a&gt;. You can join in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I've been doing a slack variant of this experiment for a while. I've got this stash of consecrated crackers in a baggie, and every day I tell them how much I hate them, taunt them with a nail, and tempt them with dominion over the earth, and creepily, they have &lt;i&gt;stayed exactly the same&lt;/i&gt;.  Lo, behold the power of preservatives, or perhaps the complete absence of nutritional value. Not even bacteria or mold wants a bit out of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/everyone_knows_that_if_you_wan.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/DQ3Q7g2Sbvg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269455004795"><id gr:original-id="981 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b1990afea4e985de</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bad law" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1515"/><category term="law" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1466"/><category term="Principle Healthcare" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/958"/><category term="Simon Singh" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/674"/><category term="Alternative Medicine" scheme="http://layscience.net/health/alternative-medicine"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://layscience.net/politics"/><title type="html">Legal Threats against Layscience.net</title><published>2010-03-24T17:27:35Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T17:27:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/981" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; On March 11th, I received a letter from some lawyers in Yorkshire.

What college student hasn&amp;#39;t chosen to blow off last minute studying in favor of a few drinks? Binge drinking is common on U.S. campuses, and the effects of such behavior on the student&amp;#39;s performance are poorly understood. There is thought to be a general negative connection between the two, but while some studies have linked drinking habits to marginal grades, others have found that these correlations disappear when corrected for the students pre-drinking performance level.

With the larger connections tenuous, Jonathan Howland and his colleagues decided to focus on more direct effects: does drinking the night before a test lead to lower grades? To determine how much a hangover affects student&amp;#39;s academic performance, researchers from the Youth Alcohol Prevention Center at Boston University School of Public Health took 196 of-age college students from the greater Boston area and enlisted them in a randomized cross-over trial, which had them drink either a placebo or enough alcohol to raise their blood alcohol well above the legal limit (0.12 g%). They then gave each student a barrage of tests the next day, including a Graduate Record Examination© (GRE) , a quiz on material they&amp;#39;d learned the day before, the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System and the Psychomotor Vigilance Test to measure neurocognitive performance, and the Profile of Mood States as well as surveys to determine the subject&amp;#39;s mood.

They found that, to no surprise to anyone, the students who had drank the night before felt downright crummy the next day. 70% of them reported some kind of hangover, and their mood was significantly worse both early in the morning and later on in the day. The drinkers also performed worse on some of the neurocognitive function tests. 

However, despite thinking they did worse, what didn&amp;#39;t suffer was the students&amp;#39; academic performance; there was no difference in GRE scores or their quiz results, suggesting neither their long-term knowledge or short-term learning suffered from their deviant evening. So while they felt like crap, the binge-drinking students were still able to pull though and do as well academically as their sober peers.

Most of the previous research in this field has focused on correlations, and not directly measured how alcohol and academic performance interact. This is the first study to experimentally test the age-old assumptions that alcohol is detrimental to college students.

Now, these data don&amp;#39;t mean that you should go out partying and expect smooth sailing - the researchers didn&amp;#39;t look at long-term effects of drinking nor did they look at how excessive doses of alcohol, like those that lead to honoring the porcelain throne for a few hours (we&amp;#39;ve all given homage at some point in our lives), affect performance. However, they do suggest that you won&amp;#39;t be totally screwed if you end up having a couple too many the night before midterms. Not that I suggest finding this out the hard way...

Before the movie was released, I had gotten to know the creator of the language, Paul Frommer, for a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06FOB-onlanguage-t.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt; column&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about Na'vi and other cinematic sci-fi languages. At my request, Paul was then kind enough to write up a Language Log guest post, "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1977"&gt;Some highlights of Na’vi&lt;/a&gt;," just in time for &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt;'s opening weekend. As Arika tells it in the Slate piece, that guest post and its comments section played a key role in the emergent subculture of linguistically engaged Na'vi-philes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Twenty-four hours after Avatar  appeared in theaters, the Web site Language Log was teeming with comments about Na'vi, the alien tongue spoken in the film. The site is always lively, but it was especially so that day because Paul Frommer—who created the language—had shown up to discuss Na'vi syntax and phonetics. His fans were asking questions. How to say "I don't speak Na'vi" or "I love you," for example. An especially ambitious commenter named "Prrton" even posted a lengthy statement in the new language:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"Ngaru ätxäle … oel set futa Hal'liwutta tsayeyktanru ngal peng futa lì'fyati Na'viyä nume nereeiu a ngeyä wotxa lì'utìtäftxurenu sì aylì'uyä sänumeti perängey ayoel.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Or, in English:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"I now ask you to tell the Hollywood bosses [Hal'liwutta tsayeyktanru] that those of us who want to learn the Na'vi language are waiting (impatiently) for your full grammar and lexicon. We promise to raise a lotta hell if what we want is not forthcoming, and 'by Eywa' we wont stop. Ever!! ;-)"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Prrton—a California consultant who goes by Britton Watkins in the real world—is clearly a little unusual. But not because he's an Avatar obsessive (there are lots of those). He's unusual in that he formulated a paragraph in Na'vi without a grammar or dictionary. And he didn't just stick a few words from the movie into random order or repeat lines that had occurred in the film. He produced an original and grammatically correct statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As further evidence of the ravenous popular interest in Na&amp;#39;vi and other invented languages like Klingon, check out the exhaustive Q&amp;amp;A that Paul and Arika recently conducted on the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; blog &lt;a href="http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/questions-answered-invented-languages/"&gt;Schott's Vocab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269450836990"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/please-take-this-dyslexia-survey.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81061d7a77c38bac</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Please Take this Dyslexia Survey</title><published>2010-03-24T16:03:58Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T16:03:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/please-take-this-dyslexia-survey.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The UK site &lt;a href="http://dyslexicbrian.com/"&gt;Dyslexic Brian&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="http://dyslexicbrian.com/uncategorized/dyslexia-fact-or-friction-quiz/"&gt;written a survey&lt;/a&gt; and would like to have responses from all over the English-speaking world.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately I completely disagree with his major point.  (Via &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/sam-harris-science-can-answer-moral-questions/"&gt;Jerry Coyne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/03/can-science-answer-moral-questions-sam-harris-makes-the-case.html"&gt;3 Quarks Daily&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He starts by admitting that most people are skeptical that science can lead us to certain values; science can tell us what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, but not what &lt;em&gt;ought to be&lt;/em&gt;.  There is a old saying, going back to David Hume, that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem"&gt;you can’t derive ought from is&lt;/a&gt;.  And Hume was right!  You can’t derive ought from is.  Yet people insist on trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris uses an ancient strategy to slip morality into what starts out as description.  He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Values are a certain kind of fact.  They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures…  If we’re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects, as indeed we are, it’s because we think they are exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering.  The crucial thing to notice here is that this is a &lt;em&gt;factual&lt;/em&gt; claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s grant the factual nature of the claim that primates are exposed to a greater range of happiness and suffering than insects or rocks.  So what?  That doesn’t mean we should &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about their suffering or happiness; it doesn’t imply &lt;em&gt;anything at all&lt;/em&gt; about morality, how we ought to feel, or how to draw the line between right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morality and science operate in very different ways.  In science, our judgments are ultimately grounded in &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;; when it comes to values we have no such recourse.  If I believe in the Big Bang model and you believe in the Steady State cosmology, I can point to the successful predictions of the cosmic background radiation, light element nucleosynthesis, evolution of large-scale structure, and so on.  Eventually you would either agree or be relegated to crackpot status.  But what if I believe that the highest moral good is to be found in the autonomy of the individual, while you believe that the highest good is to maximize the utility of some societal group?  What are the data we can point to in order to adjudicate this disagreement?  We might use empirical means to measure whether one preference or the other leads to systems that give people more successful lives on some particular scale — but that’s presuming the answer, not deriving it.  Who decides what is a successful life?  It’s ultimately a personal choice, not an objective truth to be found simply by looking closely at the world.  How are we to balance individual rights against the collective good?  You can do all the experiments you like and never find an answer to that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Harris is doing exactly what Hume warned against, in a move that is at least as old as Plato:  he’s noticing that most people &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, as a matter of empirical fact, more concerned about the fate of primates than the fate of insects, and taking that as evidence that we &lt;em&gt;ought to be&lt;/em&gt; more concerned about them; that it is morally correct to have those feelings.  But that’s a non sequitur.  After all, not everyone is all that concerned about the happiness and suffering of primates, or even of other human beings; some people take pleasure in torturing them.  And even if they didn’t, again, so what?  We are simply stating facts about how human beings feel, from which we have no warrant whatsoever to conclude things about how they should feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to derive ought from is are like attempts to reach an odd number by adding together even numbers.  If someone claims that they’ve done it, you don’t have to check their math; you know that they’ve made a mistake.  Or, to choose a different mathematical analogy, any particular judgment about right and wrong is like Euclid’s parallel postulate in geometry; there is not a unique choice that is compatible with the other axioms, and different choices could in principle give different interesting moral philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of the temptation to insist that moral judgments are objectively true is that we would like to have justification for arguing against what we see as moral outrages when they occur.  But there’s no reason why we can’t be judgmental and firm in our personal  convictions, even if we are honest that those convictions don’t have the same status as objective laws of nature.  In the real world, when we disagree with someone else’s moral judgments, we try to persuade them to see things our way; if that fails, we may (as a society) resort to more dramatic measures like throwing them in jail.  But our ability to persuade others that they are being immoral is completely unaffected — and indeed, may even be hindered — by pretending that our version of morality is objectively true.  In the end, we will always be appealing to their own moral senses, which may or may not coincide with ours.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate part of this is that Harris says a lot of true and interesting things, and threatens to undermine the power of his argument by insisting on the objectivity of moral judgments.  There are not objective moral truths (where “objective” means “existing independently of human invention”), but there are real human beings with complex sets of preferences.  What we call “morality” is an outgrowth of the interplay of those preferences with the world around us, and in particular with other human beings.  The project of moral philosophy is to make sense of our preferences, to try to make them logically consistent, to reconcile them with the preferences of others and the realities of our environments, and to discover how to fulfill them most efficiently.  Science can be extremely helpful, even crucial, in that task.  We live in a universe governed by natural laws, and it makes all the sense in the world to think that a clear understanding of those laws will be useful in helping us live our lives — for example, when it comes to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/04/abortion-and-the-architecture-of-reality/"&gt;abortion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/10/19/marriage-and-fundamental-physics/"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;.  When Harris talks about how people can reach different states of happiness, or how societies can become more successful, the relevance of science to these goals is absolutely real and worth stressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s a shame to get the whole thing off on the wrong foot by insisting that values are simply a particular version of empirical facts.   When people share values, facts can be very helpful to them in advancing their goals.  But when they don’t share values, there’s no way to show that one of the parties is “objectively wrong.”  And when you start thinking that there is, a whole set of dangerous mistakes begins to threaten.   It’s okay to admit that values can’t be derived from facts — science is great, but it’s not the only thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

There were about 300 people in the audience, and they seemed mostly on the side of evolution and rationality.  And they bought 100 copies of &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student paper at Texas State starts its report on my talk like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Coyne told a packed Alkek Teaching Theater Tuesday he could prove humans evolved from monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit sensationalistic, no?  Well,  I didn’t “prove” that humans descended from monkeys; I adduced evidence that we share a common ancestor with modern apes and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor did I say anything like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coyne said people of religious faith do not have an open mind to the concept of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;did say&lt;/em&gt; is that when Americans were polled about what they would do if a fact of science were to contravene their faith, 64% of them said they’d reject the fact in favor of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

But the &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/Non-Believing-Clergy.pdf"&gt;case studies on non-believing preachers&lt;/a&gt; recently published by Dan Dennett and Linda LaScola suggest a way that those who &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; "believe in belief" might make common ground with the New Atheists, if they would rise to the challenge.  (Okay, they won't, but anyway...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the preachers examined in the paper (I think three out of the five?) could still be classified as "believing in belief", in that they defined God as the "ground of all being" or felt that "there is room for the use of the word ‘God’ in some context", or viewed "God as a kind of poetry."  What really struck me was the way that these preachers rationalized the concealment of their more "refined" metaphorical theology from their flocks.  &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; I find far more hypocritical than those preachers who were disillusioned with religion entirely, but kept on the job because they feared for their social or family life, or their financial future.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Telling lies because you will be completely fucked if you don't might be ethically wrong, but it's very human, and anyway I'm not going to condemn anyone for that until I walk in their shoes.  If I had to tell lies for a living, and I feared I'd lose my house and maybe even my wife and son if I stopped, you'd better believe I'd go on dropping bullshit from the pulpit.  But telling lies because you are trying to protect the tender delusions of people who trust you for answer to the questions that are most important to them?  Or because you think the listeners are too dumb or simple to hear the truth?  That's never okay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What also struck me was how much this internal dialog of the preachers in Dennett's and LaScola's case study echoed a dialog that we see over and over again between the New Atheists and the "New Theologians" like Eagleton and Armstrong and their ilk.  Our side criticizes literal beliefs and dogmas, the Eaglestrongs of the world respond that we just &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier&amp;#39;s_reply#The_Courtier.27s_Reply"&gt;don't understand their sophisticated theology&lt;/a&gt;, and then they plug their ears and refuse to listen when our side points out that &lt;i&gt;that's not how most of the world practices religion&lt;/i&gt;, not even in modern supposedly-secular democracies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With that in mind, I suggest a new strategy:  When this tired old conversation crops up again, don't respond by simply dismissing apophatic theology, or whatever clever apologetics the Eaglestrongs are spewing, as something far removed from the actual practice of religion.  Instead, &lt;i&gt;challenge them&lt;/i&gt; to help get rid of this divide.  Challenge Terry Eagleton to arrange to speak to religious groups, and tell them that a literal belief in Jesus' divinity is backwards and infantile, that the true central narrative of Christianity is understanding how &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2009/04/28/terry_eagleton/print.html"&gt;"the ultimate signifier of the human condition is the tortured and murdered body of a political criminal"&lt;/a&gt;, and not any nonsense about original sins being forgiven or any of that crap.  Challenge Armstrong to go into Catholic churches, of which she was once a part, and proclaim to the congregation that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Armstrong#Career"&gt;"religion isn't about believing things"&lt;/a&gt;, and that instead of telling Africans not to use condoms, they should focus on &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Douthat-t.html"&gt;"translat[ing] these doctrines into...ethical action."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or to put it more simply:  Whenever someone tells an atheist, "But there is a much more &lt;i&gt;advanced&lt;/i&gt; theology than that!", our response should be, "Tell someone who cares."  Like you know -- people who actually &lt;i&gt;practice religion and go to church&lt;/i&gt;.  Maybe they'd like to know about your ideas about God and religion, hmmm?  And in fact, they might benefit from it quite a bit!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Eaglestrongs of the world really truly believed in their poetic/apophatic view of God, they need to do a helluva a lot more to get that message out to believers.  And as far as it goes, we can make common cause on that.  If there's one thing that Eagleton and Dawkins might agree on, it's that the idea of the virgin birth being a literal event is fucking retarded.  Let's get &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; message out there first, mm'kay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edit&lt;/b&gt;: In fairness to Armstrong, I think she does do this to a certain extent.  Her message seems to be at least as much about reform as it is about apologetics.  For instance, in researching for this post, I discovered that she intended to use a $100,000 TED prize "to initiate an international Charter for Compassion – to help restore the Golden Rule as central to religious practice and daily life throughout the world."  While I think the Golden Rule stands on its own just fine without the cloud of religion getting in the way, anything that gets the religious to cleave more closely to, you know, &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; ethics as opposed to Stone Age dogma has got to be a good thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sort of glad I stumbled on that, because it makes me a little less anti-Armstrong.  Eagleton's still an irredeemable douche, but it seems Armstrong is already spending a lot of her time working on this "common ground".  So credit where credit is due, at least.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-7085378544854781011?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269447990135"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-7172130812719450751">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1cb336aaf34365a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="skepticism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Flake Equation</title><published>2010-03-24T15:13:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T15:13:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2010/03/flake-equation.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com"&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt; wins again:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/718/"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:195px" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_flake_equation.png" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hilarious but sobering.

A typical example comes from Witold Walczak, legal director of the Pennsylvania American Civil Liberties Union, who they quoted as saying, "No one disputes that sexting can have very bad consequences, and no parent wants kids sending out naked images. But if you’ve got thousands of kids engaging in this, are you going to criminalize all of them?"  Word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But two of the law professors that were quoted felt that it should still be classified as felony child pornography -- admittedly, only as a symbolic gesture, though they would rely on the disrection of prosecutors (hardy-har-har) to avoid the disaster of teens being branded for life just for being teens.

There is a surprising amount of controversy about the ability of physical activity to prevent the development of obesity. Sure, obese individuals tend to perform less physical activity than their lean counterparts, but that doesn&amp;#39;t prove causation. And almost every week it seems that there is a news story reporting that the obesity epidemic is caused by diet. Period. If you believe these articles, physical activity plays a minor role, if any role at all. Some have even (erroneously) suggested that physical activity increases the risk of weight gain (for a thorough debunking of a recent TIME article on this subject, click here).

One of the problems of trying to untangle the role of physical activity in the development of obesity is that most studies use indirect measures of physical activity, like self-report questionnaires. Not surprisingly, there is a lot of error when people are reporting a socially-desirable behaviour like physical activity, as they tend to err on the positive side. And questionnaires also often give several fixed options, for example &amp;quot;Are you normally active for 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes per day?&amp;quot;. If you are active for 20 minutes per day, would you pick 15 or 30? Either way, it introduces a lot of error, which makes it very difficult to determine the specific role that your current physical activity levels play in the development of obesity down the road.

This is billed as the first observation of quantum phenomena with a &amp;quot;macroscopic&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;naked eye visible&amp;quot; object.

Of course, there&amp;#39;s a nice bit of irony in a story about quantum effects in a &amp;quot;naked eye visible&amp;quot; object that is accompanied by an image of the object in question taken with a scanning electron microscope. The longest dimension of the object in question is about the thickness of a human hair, which means it technically is naked-eye visible, provided you have pretty good eyes. In a different context, though, something this size would probably be billed as &amp;quot;nanotechnology&amp;quot; (as its smallest dimension is about one micron, or 1000 nanometers).

Still, this is unquestionably the largest thing ever observed in its quantum ground state, so it&amp;#39;s big news. As you can tell by the fact that it&amp;#39;s in Nature. So, what, exactly, have they done, and why is it cool? To vary things up a little, I&amp;#39;ll do this one in Q&amp;amp;A format.

What, exactly, have they done? A group at UCSB has cooled a microfabricated resonator to its quantum ground state. This means that they have removed all the energy that it&amp;#39;s possible to remove from the oscillating mode of the resonator-- the only motion left is the zero-point energy that&amp;#39;s impossible to remove. They have also demonstrated the ability to make small excitations of this oscillating mode, both by directly driving it with microwaves, and also by coupling it to a &amp;quot;qubit&amp;quot; fabricated on the same chip.

In quantum mechanics, oscillating objects can only have discrete amounts of energy-- the zero-point energy plus 1, 2, 3,... times the energy associated with the oscillation frequency-- so the behavior they see is very much unlike a classical oscillator, which has energy that can be continuously varied from zero to whatever you like. What they see here shows signs of the discrete energy values you expect for a quantum oscillator, not a classical one.

So, they, like, took pictures of it moving, or something? I mean, it&amp;#39;s visible, right? Not exactly.

The Freethought Association of Canada, the charity that brought you the wildly successful Canadian Atheist Bus Campaign, is having its 2010 annual general meeting!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everyone interested in the FAC and its future is welcome to attend the meeting and participate. We will be voting both on our 2010-2011 Board of Executives, and on a number of very exciting changes to the mandate and bylaws proposed throughout this past year. We will also have a Year in Review report from our current President, Kaiti Kish, as well as our yearly financial report. Finally, a discussion regarding the future of the FAC will be held, where any and all ideas are more than welcome!
Nominations will be held for: president, vice-president multimedia, vice-president special projects, treasurer and secretary. There will be a vote for the creation of two new positions (vice-president external and vice-president internal) if this motion is passed we will carry on with the voting for these positions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When: Saturday, April 17 2010&lt;br&gt;
Where: Center for Inquiry - Ontario (216 Beverley St. Toronto, ON) however if you are not in Toronto but still want to be involved in the Freethought Association we strongly encourage you to contact us! We would like to expand our executive board across Canada and therefore welcome national participation.&lt;br&gt;

The school council has &amp;#39;doctrinal issues&amp;#39; with the fellow they hired as principal — he seems to think that the idea that men have authority over women is invalid. &lt;a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/article_932a56c8-36d4-11df-a17e-001cc4c03286.html"&gt;So they had a meeting to fire John Hartwig&lt;/a&gt;, and something at the meeting &lt;i&gt;shocked&lt;/i&gt; the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of Hartwig said they were shocked to learn that women church members would not be permitted to speak during a meeting to decide Hartwig's fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd be shocked, too. Except that I'd also be shocked by this, which everyone there seemed to take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Females do not have voting privileges, but are generally allowed to speak at meetings, according to Klaetsch. Sunday's meeting was the first time in recent history that St. John's Council President Don Finseth exercised his authority to prevent females from speaking, church members say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, women of St John's Lutheran Church of Baraboo, Wisconsin, &lt;i&gt;WAKE UP&lt;/i&gt;. Leave that awful institution. Why are you continuing to wallow in a poisonous environment that treats you like scum?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/its_the_21st_century_wisconsin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tnOdK6P5dVI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269446243702"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/youd_think_conservatives_who_w.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc6a73b71eabc03c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">You'd think conservatives who worship the founding fathers would have a little more respect</title><published>2010-03-24T15:06:42Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T15:06:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/nMt41Q7306I/youd_think_conservatives_who_w.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/youd_think_conservatives_who_w.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/texas_con.jpeg" width="450" height="300" alt="texas_con.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Dennis Meredith to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm originally from Texas, but my jobs have taken me all around the country. I've always been fascinated by science and received my B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Texas. However, I discovered my true calling when I went into the science writing program at the University of Wisconsin, where I received an M.S. in Biochemistry-Science Writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dennis Meredith pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Dennis%20Meredith%20pic.jpg" width="299" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;From the UW science writing program, I got my first job in the UW Medical Center News Office as assistant director. After that, I took science writing jobs at the University of Rhode Island, MIT, Caltech, Cornell, and ended up at Duke as the Director of the Office of Research Communication. I was known as the DORC of Duke. Always pay attention to the acronym before you take the job! My most interesting project was the research news site &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org" title=""&gt;EurekAlert&lt;/a&gt;!, which I conceived and helped AAAS develop. It now links more than 4,500 journalists to news from 800 subscribing research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I "retired" from Duke three years ago. I put the word in quotes because I'm still doing full-time science writing and consulting. My biggest project now by far is promoting my book "&lt;a href="http://www.explainingresearch.com" title=""&gt;Explaining Research&lt;/a&gt;", published by Oxford University Press. And of course, there's my blog, &lt;a href="http://www.researchexplainer.com" title=""&gt;Research Explainer&lt;/a&gt;. My central goal is really to change the culture of science and engineering to value lay-level communications more. By giving scientists and engineers the communication tools and techniques they need--from news releases to video to blogging--I hope to increase their engagement with the public and their influence in such critical areas as global warming and science education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What fascinates me is the Web's immense power to make each person a media outlet. What's more, the stunning increase in power and lowered cost of media technologies such as video cameras means that everybody can be a print/radio/TV outlet. The challenge for me is helping some of the people who have the most important things to say--scientists and engineers--take advantage of these technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll admit some timidity when I started blogging. Even though I've been writing science for more than four decades, the idea of hitting a button and having my words instantly published was daunting. I'd always been "protected" by being in a magazine or part of a university news operation. Since then, blogging has not only become easier, but I've realized that it is a central tool in updating and expanding on the book. Since all the book's references are online, I can easily insert a blog post into the references that contains new information or points I didn't think of when I was writing the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs&lt;/a&gt; by the participants at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first discovered science blogs when I started blogging. I was delighted with the vast range of voices out there. I can&amp;#39;t really say what some of my favorite blogs are. It&amp;#39;s like asking which do you like better, tacos, ice cream, chardonnay, or oysters? I get something out of all the blogs I read, and each time I discover a new one, I find a refreshing new voice and new ideas. For me, however, the prototypical blog has been Bora&amp;#39;s--not to suck up to my host for this Q&amp;amp;A. I  was struck from the beginning by Bora&amp;#39;s ability to so effectively blend science and communication issues in a blog, and this eclecticism has broadened my view of what a blog can and should be--a broad-ranging exploration of interesting issues, whatever they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the best aspect of each ScienceOnline conference has been walking into this electric atmosphere of creativity and getting a delightful, inspiring charge of energy and ideas. For ScienceOnline2010, the most productive sessions for me were those on blogging techniques, scientific visualization and video. For next year, I'd recommend a significant workshop on Web video techniques, in which participants are invited to bring their cameras, especially the pocket-sized ones, and create and edit videos. I'm now just beginning to learn how to make quality videos, and any coaching would help. What has surprised me as I've trained myself is how simple techniques of lighting, composition and audio can greatly improve videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again (as well as later at AAAS on our panel) and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_24.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/V5FsjleeDOU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269443598148"><id gr:original-id="985 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f7af1d703c10ab89</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Skeptical Women</title><published>2010-03-24T13:54:20Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T13:54:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/985" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://layscience.net/files/AdaLovelace_450pxls_01.jpg" width="350" height="350" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is written for &lt;a href="http://findingada.com/"&gt;Ada Lovelace Day&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating women in science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started going to &lt;a href="http://london.skepticsinthepub.org/"&gt;Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt; (SitP) in 2003, it was a small affair in a room over a pub near Borough, in London. I was sometimes the only woman there and even on a good night, we were really in the minority in a room full of men, some of whom were seriously lacking in social skills. I wanted to get more involved and, quite early on, I helped test a woman who wanted to claim James Randi's million dollars because she could find missing people with a pendulum and an A-Z. She couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;

She recently emigrated there from Scotland.  She’s been blogging for five years and became active in secular issues after learning there are organizations trying get God into American public schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike America, Australia has no separation of church and state. Our version of America’s First Amendment is called &lt;a href="http://australianpolitics.com/constitution/text/116.shtml"&gt;section 116&lt;/a&gt; which states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has allowed room for the religious right to get God into the public schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Education has stipulated that schools are required to provide one hour a week to religious education where a school chaplain is available. Not just in religiously affiliated schools, but all government schools. It’s called the &lt;a href="http://schoolchaplaincy.org.au/"&gt;National School Chaplaincy Program&lt;/a&gt; (NSCP), where people are trained up and placed as Chaplains in our public schools. To put it simply: There are evangelists in the schools, preaching to our children. They get an hour every week to spread the word of God to our kids. This program started in 2007 with promised funding of $165 million over three years to the Chaplaincy program. In November last year, the current government allotted &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/national/rudd-to-give-428m-for-school-chaplains/story-e6frfku9-1225801098567"&gt;a further $42.8 million&lt;/a&gt; to extend the program for another two years. The role of the Chaplain is to offer education in values and ethics and it seems the government feels the Bible is the greatest source for this education. The schools may also use the chaplains as mentors, playground staff, and as a general useful body and extra set of eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person is not required to hold any particular qualifications to be a Christian Religious Education (CRE) teacher. They don’t need child education qualifications or counseling qualifications — they don’t even require a high school diploma. Chaplains need a Bachelors degree in Theology/Ministry Education or Counseling. &lt;a href="http://www.rationalist.com.au/"&gt;The Rationalist Society of Australia&lt;/a&gt; questioned the Minister for Education, &lt;strong&gt;Julia Gillard&lt;/strong&gt;, about the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://rationalist.com.au/images/stories/To_Gillard_re_Chaplaincy_Program.pdf"&gt;Effectivness of Chaplaincy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; report (PDF) done last year which stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… of the 1031 chaplains to respond, at best 132 or 12%, had qualifications at diploma level or above and almost half of those qualifications were in chaplaincy, pastoral care and theology. With only 2.5% qualified in counseling or psychology. Yet the report states that chaplains have been called in to help with children’s anger issues, grief and loss, bullying, peer pressure and self esteem as well as self harm and suicide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the more devout the chaplain, the less likely they are to refer students to professional services with dire consequences.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They aren’t alone in their criticism. &lt;a href="http://www.johnkaye.org.au/campaigns/education/chaplaincy-program-study-flawed-and-biased-conclusions-not-justified"&gt;The Greens&lt;/a&gt; party also argue the report was flawed, as does the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzoW_aTO0nk&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;Australian Secular Lobby&lt;/a&gt; (ASL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, which is a Christian country, has a secular religious education which covers seven major religions and is taught from a cultural perspective. It encourages community, understanding of diversity, and an appreciation of the variety of cultures within the country. Australia is not a Christian country, yet it has Christian, Catholic and Jewish religious education in its public state schools which includes prayer and Bible study. You cannot mix the classes; you only get to choose one. (Here in Victoria there is no accepted module for Islam, Hindu, Sikhism, Baha’i or Buddhism so there are no chaplains available.) Most schools get the Protestant curriculum by default and if parents want the other modules for their kids, the parents have to request it from the principal, provided there is a trained Chaplain available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents are able to opt-out their children from the religious education class, however that hour is spent idle. My children are separated for this hour from the rest of the class and given computer time. My 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grader and her fellow opt-out students are unsupervised for that hour. Some parents have reported their child sat for the hour in empty hallways, alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian states all have different ways of approaching the religious education problem. Victoria is trying to get a Humanist curriculum approved, but as is expected, they’re coming up against the &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/religion-in-schools-to-go-godfree-20081213-6xxs.html?page=-1"&gt;typical prejudice&lt;/a&gt;. Access Ministries Research director &lt;strong&gt;Jenny Stokes&lt;/strong&gt; said, “If you go there [allowing a Humanist curriculum], where do you stop? What about Witchcraft or Satanism? If you accredit Humanism, then those things would have an equal claim to be taught in schools.” Most of the states have MPs denying that there is evangelizing in schools, despite the obvious proof seen in the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM8iDCfl28s&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;recruitment&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ACCESSmin"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.accessministries.org.au/"&gt;Access Ministries&lt;/a&gt;, an organization which trains Chaplains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked with &lt;strong&gt;Hugh Wilson&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://australiansecularlobby.com/"&gt;ASL&lt;/a&gt; about their opinions on religious education; “ASL arose, by accident, formed by concerned parents to tackle the increasingly prevalent evangelical religiosity of Queensland state schools. Following close on the heels of school chaplains came hordes of evangelical church volunteers and their Hillsong Church-designed-and-implemented gendered programs. More recently, Christian ‘mentors’ have been allowed to work alone with ‘at risk’ students in state schools. These have included Baptists and other believers, organized by the Baptist centered organization, World Vision. Almost as a mild side distraction, the Queensland Studies Authority, the peak body that decides just what school students learn, declines to ‘design out’ the allowed and practiced teaching of Creationism and Intelligent Design in Queensland state school science classes, or any other class an individual classroom teacher might feel inclined to inject a little ‘religion’ into. All of this has been accepted without question by successive education ministers and premiers, all of whom now promote Queensland as ‘the Smart State’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more troubling is what happens when the girls go to high school and begin the &lt;a href="http://myhillsong.com/shine"&gt;Shine Program&lt;/a&gt;. Shine says it promotes self esteem, confidence and self worth, however one parent (wishing to remain anonymous) &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Shine-shenanigans-final.pdf"&gt;claims a different experience&lt;/a&gt; (DOC): “…over the next few weeks it became clear that the girls were being urged to adopt the kind of passive/conservative Christian stereotypes that we are all long familiar with: they were being groomed for domestic and spiritual bliss as demure brides of Man and Christ.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;strong&gt;Ron Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, a Queensland parent, has embarked upon a course of action which will see a writ being served in the High Court in the not too distant future as to the legality of federal funds being used to support the NSCP. This is an important move, yet the local newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Courier Mail&lt;/em&gt; (Sunday edition), hasn’t printed this online — though they did publish it and &lt;a href="http://cpds.apana.org.au/Teams/Articles/chaplains.jpg"&gt;you can see a scan of the article here&lt;/a&gt;. Williams has taken &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/dad-files-protest-on-school-ark-story/story-e6frg6oo-1111118227847"&gt;previous actions&lt;/a&gt; against his daughter’s school when a class that was supposed to discuss animals and the noises they made used the Ark story as reference material. Yet Queensland Education states there were “no references to ‘God’ or the biblical story of Noah’s Ark made in Kathleen’s classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience at our daughter’s school initially assured me that the CRE class was “Just some Bible stories with a moral lean. Nothing to worry about.” and had allowed my daughter to be a part of the class. One day she came home and asked me “Did God make the Big Bang?” because that was what her Chaplain had told her. I filed a complaint because cosmology and Creationism do not mix and it was unacceptable for the Chaplain to make such a claim. The outcome was that my daughter had “taken the comments out of context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I made several phone calls to try and acquire the syllabus for the CRE classes, as I now have both daughters in school and sincerely wanted to know what was involved in the classes. The school refused to supply the curriculum, advising me to contact Access Ministries because they are a separate entity from the schools. Access Ministries gave me a suspicious interrogation — apparently no other parent has ever asked for a copy of what’s being taught to their kids. What I received was what you’d expect in a Sunday school class. The &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/QUEST-1-Green-TB-Scope.pdf"&gt;age 5-6 classes&lt;/a&gt; get Creationism (unit 4) before they ever get a science class. The &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/QUEST-2-Green-TB-Scope.pdf"&gt;10-11-year-olds&lt;/a&gt; get told how much God loves them and wants a personal relationship with each them, and also what to do when they’ve disappointed God by sinning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not religious education. This is the indoctrination of children into the Christian faith with full support of the Australian government, funded by taxpayers. Concerned Australians need to speak to their principals and raise questions with the board of education and challenge their MPs. Challenge all your MPs, not just your affiliated party. Get your MPs to question your Ministers for Education. I’ve found that an email gets a response.  As more parents raise concerns, it will provide a stronger argument to push for reform of the Education Act. Find what groups are active in your state and get motivated to find a solution.&lt;br&gt;

It’s a vast storm, a bloody-colored hurricane that is at least four centuries old, and larger in size than several Earths. It can be seen easily even in a small telescope, and is one of the most studied features in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet for all that, it’s still poorly understood. How has it lasted so long? What is going on inside of it? How did it form in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1010/"&gt;New observations using the Very Large Telescope&lt;/a&gt; (together with data from the Gemini, Subaru, and IRTF observatories) have taken us a step closer to finding the answers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/archives/images/screen/eso1010a.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/vlt_redspot.jpg" alt="vlt_redspot" title="vlt_redspot" width="594" height="740"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooooool. On top is an infrared view of the Spot (as well as its little brother, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/17/jupiters-red-spot-chews-up-and-spits-out-a-storm/"&gt;Oval BA&lt;/a&gt;, on the left) from the VLT taken in 2008, and on bottom, for comparison, is the same view from Hubble taken just days earlier. The VLT image was taken at a wavelength of 10.8 microns, about 14 times the wavelength our eye can see. Objects at just about the freezing point of water emit IR at that wavelength. On Jupiter, the atmosphere at a pressure about half of Earth’s pressure at sea level emits at that temperature and wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What these images show is how Jupiter’s atmosphere circulates up and down in the Spot. The core of the Spot, which appears red to our eye, is warm, and dark lanes are where the gas is being drawn down into Jupiter’s depths. Because the center is warmer — by just a few degrees — it provides an upwelling in the middle of the Spot. This upwelling creates a weak clockwise flow of air, despite the storm’s general counter-clockwise rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, these observations link the color of the Spot to temperature, even if the exact mechanism for this link is unknown. But any clues we can find will help us understand this incredible hurricane bigger than some planets. Mind you, studying them on Jupiter gives us insight into how storms behave on Earth as well. Scientific observations thrive on diversity, on comparing one set of conditions to another, and seeing how the outcome changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jupiter is vastly different than Earth, but by gazing at it we gaze back at ourselves. That’s the way science works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started going to &lt;a href="http://london.skepticsinthepub.org/"&gt;Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt; (SitP) in 2003, it was a small affair in a room over a pub near Borough, in London. I was sometimes the only woman there and even on a good night, we were really in the minority in a room full of men, some of whom were seriously lacking in social skills.

A brief excerpt of the excerpt:

The idea of deliberately manipulating the weather or the climate is an especially powerful notion. We equate weather with mood because our bodies are so affected by temperature and moisture and light. Storms trouble our minds as well as threaten our coasts. Climate is our experience of the weather over time and space, the way weather shapes our summers or our neighborhoods. To control climate — especially now, at a time when it seems so unpredictable — promises stability and peace for us and our children.

The seductive idea of weather and climate control has been a constant trope in the human imagination. The sorcerer Prospero in Shakespeare’s Tempest conjures bad weather to drive his enemy’s boat ashore. In the 1985 film Brewster’s Millions, Montgomery Brewster, played by Richard Pryor, invests in a scheme to haul icebergs to the Middle East to provide water. Advanced societies control the weather as a matter of course in the worlds of Star Trek and Dune.

&lt;p&gt;If you were at Skepchicamp and want to throw back a few in honor, show up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren’t at Skepchicamp, you should totally come out anyway… because it’s skeptics and there’s beer and there’s fun. Also, I’m barely able to fit into most buildings in Chicago at this point, so this is probably my last chance to hang out for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Skepchicamp party guarantee: WE WILL HAVE CHAIRS! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who: You! And me! And Skeptics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What: Skepchicamp celebration! Drinking celebration! Holy-shit-how-have-you-not-had-that-baby-yet celebration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where: &lt;a href="http://galwayarms.com"&gt;Galway Arms&lt;/a&gt;, 2442 N Clark, Chicago&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When: Saturday, March 27, 7pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why: You need a why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How: Show the hell up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started going to &lt;a href="http://london.skepticsinthepub.org/"&gt;Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt; (SitP) in 2003, it was a small affair in a room over a pub near Borough, in London. I was sometimes the only woman there and even on a good night, we were really in the minority in a room full of men, some of whom were seriously lacking in social skills. I wanted to get more involved and, quite early on, I helped test a woman who wanted to claim James Randi's million dollars because she could find missing people with a pendulum and an A-Z. She couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the responsibilities of this office is to monitor workplace fatalities. Each week, a roundup of deaths in the workplace are posted online. They make for &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.osha.gov/dep/fatcat/dep_fatcat.html"&gt;compelling reading&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis states on the site: "With every one of these fatalities, the lives of a worker's family members were shattered and forever changed. We can't forget that fact". Yet the lists only hold the briefest of details. The company involved and its location are recorded, along with a brief description of the events surrounding the worker's death. Nothing about the worker is included - we've no way of knowing their age, profession, or individual circumstances. The only thing we know about them is that they died working on the job. Each new entry is as inevitable as the click of a metronome and delivered with the same passion - as David Marsh said about his film &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Death_Trip"&gt;Wisconsin Death Trip&lt;/a&gt;: "the real pathos [is] contained in a four line newspaper report that simultaneously records and dismisses the end of someone's life".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, when you put them all together, a pattern begins to emerge. Construction workers fare worst. People fall from ladders, or are crushed by machinery. Farm workers fall into concrete pits or crash ATVs. Many simply collapse at work, as if completely exhausted of life. But these are interspersed with the unusual - a woman shot at work by a jealous husband, or the plain unlucky: a man who died of blood poisoning after a customer's dog bit him. Others recount dreadful ends to lives - people fall into slurry pits and drown, their co-workers overcome by noxious fumes whilst trying to save them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to build something that would bring out these stories to a wider audience, and it was clear that a microblogging site like Twitter offered the perfect vehicle. By connecting an account with an automated system, I could upload the records and have them sent out at regular intervals, like a church bell tolling on the hour, reminding us of the 5,000+ workers who died on site last year. Thus, &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/deathcountr"&gt;DeathCountr&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://time2tweet.appspot.com/"&gt;Time2Tweet&lt;/a&gt; as it allowed me to upload batches of text in csv or txt format. The datasets were free to pull from the OSHA website. They needed a bit of tidying up. The dates weren't stored properly, but ultimately I decided to strip them out anyway. I wanted the feed to be disorientating and unsettling, in order to undermine the sense that these deaths were closed cases, that they would never happen again. It's a modern day Wisconsin Death Trip, the stories combine to give a reflection of present day America, where death at work is disproportionately heaped upon the poor and the unskilled, the manual laborers and the elderly. It's about the unspoken contract of our society that tolerates rates of mortality in the most essential trades that we would never accept in its highest echelons. It's also about the unfair, the unlucky, and the absurd ways in which you might experience your last ever day at work. I hope you find it interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

Thus, apart from a couple of quick retweets, I did not have the opportunity until now to take a better look and to say something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the news at the &lt;a href="http://www.seedmediagroup.com/media/#news_234" title=""&gt;Seed site&lt;/a&gt; and download the official &lt;a href="http://www.seedmediagroup.com/docs/RB%20Awards.pdf" title=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. And listening to the podcast &lt;a href="http://beyondthebookcast.com/2010-research-blogging-awards-announced/" title=""&gt;about the awards AND opening the envelopes with winners's names&lt;/a&gt; is great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, take some time to go through the &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/static/index/page/awards" title=""&gt;list of all Winners and Finalists&lt;/a&gt; - check them out and bookmark those you like - these are the best of the best. The blogs were nominated by the broader science online community, the finalists were picked by &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/news/?p=941" title=""&gt;a star-studded panel of judges&lt;/a&gt;, and the final winners were determined by votes of the members of the ResearchBlogging.org community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, in a tough competition of some brilliant bloggers, my SciBling Ed Yong of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience" title=""&gt;Not Exactly Rocket Science&lt;/a&gt; blog swept the board, and deservedly so. He won in three categories: Research Blog of the Year, Best Lay-Level blog and Blog Post of the Year. Of course, this is the Year of Duck Sex, so it is not surprising that the Blog Post of the Year is on this exciting topic, Ed's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/ballistic_penises_and_corkscrew_vaginas_-_the_sexual_battles.php" title=""&gt;Ballistic penises and corkscrew vaginas - the sexual battles of ducks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won something, too. I felt I had a chance in the category of Research Twitterer of the Year - an lo and behold: I won in this category! Or, as Michael Robinson &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ExplorationBlog/status/10937722584" title=""&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, this title should be better called "Esteemed Twitterary Figure" ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also nominated in the category of Best Blog -- Biology, but did not believe I could win it in company of some wonderful bloggers who write posts about peer-reviewed research much more often than I do. But I guess the community thought that when I do write, I write well, so I found myself surprised winning in this category as well. This definitely motivates me to do more of this...and I have already assembled a nice little pile of recent papers to blog about very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your support. And big Congratulations to &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/static/index/page/awards" title=""&gt;all the winners&lt;/a&gt; and finalists, all great bloggers worth your regular daily reading. And if you blog about scientific papers and are not aggregating your posts on ResearchBlogging.org yet, perhaps it's time to apply today.&lt;/p&gt;

While there was token skepticism (by Edzard Ernst, of course, who is the media’s go-to expert for CAM), the article credulously reported the marketing hype of acupuncture proponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the article Beck admits that “some critics” claim that acupuncture provides nothing more than a placebo effect, but this was followed by the usual canard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t see any disconnect between how acupuncture works and how a  placebo works,” says radiologist Vitaly Napadow at the Martinos center.  “The body knows how to heal itself. That’s what a placebo does, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a bold claim, and very common among CAM proponents, especially acupuncturists. As the data increasingly shows that acupuncture (and other implausible treatments) provides no benefit beyond placebo, we hear the special pleading that placebos work also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that true? It turns out there is a literature on the placebo effect itself, and the evidence suggests that placebos generally do not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may seem counter-intuitive, since the gold standard of clinical trials is placebo-controlled, because placebo effects can be quite large. However, most such trials do not contain a no-treatment arm (comparing a placebo intervention to nothing at all). What this means, as I have written about before, is that placebo effects, as measured in clinical trials, includes a host of factors – everything other than a physiological response to an active treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These placebo effects include the bias of the researchers, the desire of the subjects to please the researchers and to get well, non-specific effects of receiving medical intervention and attention, and other artifacts of the research process. When we remove all of these biases and artifacts, is there a real effect left behind – what most people think of when they think of “the” placebo effect: a mind-over-matter but real improvement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of so-called CAM would like you to believe that “the” placebo effect is all a real biological effect resulting from the body’s self-healing ability. But it turns out, this is simply not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hróbjartsson  and Gøtzsche have been studying the placebo effect for years, reviewing the literature, especially for trials that contain a no-treatment arm. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091554"&gt;Their most recent review&lt;/a&gt; is very illuminating. They conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical  effects in general. However, in certain settings placebo interventions  can influence patient-reported outcomes, especially pain and nausea,  though it is difficult to distinguish patient-reported effects of  placebo from biased reporting. The effect on pain varied, even among  trials with low risk of bias, from negligible to clinically important.  Variations in the effect of placebo were partly explained by variations  in how trials were conducted and how patients were informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break this down a bit. First, they found that when you look at any objective or clinically important outcome – the kinds of things that would indicate a real biological effect – there is no discernible placebo effect. There is no mind-over-matter self healing that can be attributed to the placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the authors found is also most compatible with the hypothesis that placebo effects, as measured in clinical trials, are mostly due to bias. Specifically, significant placebo effects were found only for subjectively reported symptoms. Further, the size of this effect varied widely among trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latter feature is very important. If there were a significant physiological placebo effect we would expect to see a consistent or baseline effect among trials. The tremendous variability suggests that it was the rigor of trial design that allowed for lesser or greater bias resulting in a measured placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-regression analyses showed that larger effects of placebo  interventions were associated with physical placebo interventions (e.g.  sham acupuncture), patient-involved outcomes (patient-reported outcomes  and observer-reported outcomes involving patient cooperation), small  trials, and trials with the explicit purpose of studying placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the more patients were involved in the reporting of outcomes (as opposed to measuring outcomes) the greater the placebo effect. This is most consistent with bias as a cause. Also, as has been reported before, physical interventions result in a large placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have hypothesized that time and attention provided by some “alternative” practitioners result in a greater placebo effect, justifying the intervention. However, that was not a factor apparent in this study. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6WXX-4Y5H4MM-C&amp;amp;_user=483692&amp;amp;_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2010&amp;amp;_rdoc=11&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=browse&amp;amp;_srch=doc-info%28%23toc%237170%232010%23999009998%231596097%23FLA%23display%23Volume%29&amp;amp;_cdi=7170&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;_ct=14&amp;amp;_acct=C000022720&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=483692&amp;amp;md5=648e939aefc8ceb1bf3c637de474fef1"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt;, comparing placebo effect sizes for homeopathic treatments and mainstream treatments (which are comparable in terms of the physical intervention) found no difference in placebo effect sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing evidence strongly suggests that placebo effects are mostly comprised of bias in reporting and observation and non-specific effects. There is no measurable physiological benefit from placebo interventions for any objective outcome. There is a measured benefit for some subjective outcomes (mostly pain, nausea, asthma, and phobias), but the wide variation in effect size suggests this is due to trial design (and therefore bias) rather than a real effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, any perceived benefit in subjective symptoms seems to be greater for physical interventions (perhaps a hands-on benefit) but is the same for mainstream vs novel treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is no justification to be found in the placebo effect for using unscientific or dubious interventions. Placebo medicine is a sham. And any potential placebo benefit worth having can be fully realized with science-based interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that Dr. Napadow may have been unwittingly correct when he said that acupuncture is no different from placebo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of a new exorcist by Sydney's Catholic Church precedes a warning by a senior clergyman that generation Y risks a dangerous fascination with the occult fuelled by the &lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt; series.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian Porteous, the auxiliary bishop of Sydney, warns that pursuing such ''alternative'' relaxation techniques as yoga, reiki massages and tai chi may encourage experimentation with ''deep and dark spiritual ideas and traditions''.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Twilight&lt;/i&gt; isn&amp;#39;t magic — it&amp;#39;s just badly written and mindless. Those spritiual ideas aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;deep and dark&amp;quot;, they&amp;#39;re just stupid. And I put exorcism in the same category, as a ridiculous, ignorant practice based on rank superstition. We gain nothing by replacing reiki massages and sparkly vampires with old geezers waving censers and chanting at demons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Porteous has been doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exorcism is no fantasy according to the church, with the Sydney archdiocese last month appointing an as-yet unnamed priest, suitably ''endowed with piety, knowledge, prudence and integrity of life'' to conduct exorcisms, as required by Catholic canon law.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In Rome, the Vatican is preparing its first official English translation of the rite of exorcism, which was promulgated in 1614 and reissued in 1999. Its chief exorcist, Father Gabriele Amorth, claimed this month to have carried out 70,000 exorcisms. Bishop Porteous - who has stood in as exorcist for the Sydney archdiocese over the past five years - warns that yoga, reiki massages and tai chi can lead to people being in the grip of ''demonic forces''.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people are just nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009789" title=""&gt;A New Basal Sauropodomorph Dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone of Southern Utah&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Basal sauropodomorphs, or 'prosauropods,' are a globally widespread paraphyletic assemblage of terrestrial herbivorous dinosaurs from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic. In contrast to several other landmasses, the North American record of sauropodomorphs during this time interval remains sparse, limited to Early Jurassic occurrences of a single well-known taxon from eastern North America and several fragmentary specimens from western North America. On the basis of a partial skeleton, we describe here a new basal sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone of southern Utah, Seitaad ruessi gen. et sp. nov. The partially articulated skeleton of Seitaad was likely buried post-mortem in the base of a collapsed dune foreset. The new taxon is characterized by a plate-like medial process of the scapula, a prominent proximal expansion of the deltopectoral crest of the humerus, a strongly inclined distal articular surface of the radius, and a proximally and laterally hypertrophied proximal metacarpal I. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Seitaad as a derived basal sauropodomorph closely related to plateosaurid or massospondylid 'prosauropods' and its presence in western North America is not unexpected for a member of this highly cosmopolitan clade. This occurrence represents one of the most complete vertebrate body fossil specimens yet recovered from the Navajo Sandstone and one of the few basal sauropodomorph taxa currently known from North America.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009241" title=""&gt;The Number of Cultural Traits Is Correlated with Female Group Size but Not with Male Group Size in Chimpanzee Communities&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What determines the number of cultural traits present in chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) communities is poorly understood. In humans, theoretical models suggest that the frequency of cultural traits can be predicted by population size. In chimpanzees, however, females seem to have a particularly important role as cultural carriers. Female chimpanzees use tools more frequently than males. They also spend more time with their young, skewing the infants' potential for social learning towards their mothers. In Gombe, termite fishing has been shown to be transmitted from mother to offspring. Lastly, it is female chimpanzees that transfer between communities and thus have the possibility of bringing in novel cultural traits from other communities. From these observations we predicted that females are more important cultural carriers than males. Here we show that the reported number of cultural traits in chimpanzee communities correlates with the number of females in chimpanzee communities, but not with the number of males. Hence, our results suggest that females are the carriers of chimpanzee culture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009791" title=""&gt;Captive Housing during Water Vole (Arvicola terrestris) Reintroduction: Does Short-Term Social Stress Impact on Animal Welfare?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Animals captive bred for reintroduction are often housed under conditions which are not representative of their preferred social structure for at least part of the reintroduction process. Specifically, this is most likely to occur during the final stages of the release programme, whilst being housed during transportation to the release site. The degree of social stress experienced by individuals during this time may negatively impact upon their immunocompetence. We examined two measure of stress - body weight and Leukocyte Coping Capacity (LCC) - to investigate the effects of group size upon captive-bred water voles destined for release within a reintroduction program. Water voles were housed in laboratory cages containing between one and eight individuals. LCC scores were negatively correlated with group size, suggesting that individuals in larger groups experienced a larger degree of immuno-suppression than did individuals housed in smaller groups or individually. During the course of the study mean body weights increased, in contrast to expectations from a previous study. This was attributed to the individuals sampled being sub-adults and thus growing in length and weight during the course of the investigation. The reintroduction process will inevitably cause some stress to the release cohort. However, for water voles we conclude that the stress experienced may be reduced by decreasing group size within captive colony and/or transportation housing practises. These findings are of significance to other species' reintroductions, in highlighting the need to consider life-history strategies when choosing housing systems for animals being maintained in captivity prior to release to the wild. A reduction in stress experienced at the pre-release stage may improve immunocompetence and thus animal welfare and initial survival post-release.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009829" title=""&gt;The Unbearable Lightness of Health Science Reporting: A Week Examining Italian Print Media&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although being an important source of science news information to the public, print news media have often been criticized in their credibility. Health-related content of press media articles has been examined by many studies underlining that information about benefits, risks and costs are often incomplete or inadequate and financial conflicts of interest are rarely reported. However, these studies have focused their analysis on very selected science articles. The present research aimed at adopting a wider explorative approach, by analysing all types of health science information appearing on the Italian national press in one-week period. Moreover, we attempted to score the balance of the articles. We collected 146 health science communication articles defined as articles aiming at improving the reader's knowledge on health from a scientific perspective. Articles were evaluated by 3 independent physicians with respect to different divulgation parameters: benefits, costs, risks, sources of information, disclosure of financial conflicts of interest and balance. Balance was evaluated with regard to exaggerated or non correct claims. The selected articles appeared on 41 Italian national daily newspapers and 41 weekly magazines, representing 89% of national circulation copies: 97 articles (66%) covered common medical treatments or basic scientific research and 49 (34%) were about new medical treatments, procedures, tests or products. We found that only 6/49 (12%) articles on new treatments, procedures, tests or products mentioned costs or risks to patients. Moreover, benefits were always maximized and in 16/49 cases (33%) they were presented in relative rather than absolute terms. The majority of stories (133/146, 91%) did not report any financial conflict of interest. Among these, 15 were shown to underreport them (15/146, 9.5%), as we demonstrated that conflicts of interest did actually exist. Unbalanced articles were 27/146 (18%). Specifically, the probability of unbalanced reporting was significantly increased in stories about a new treatment, procedure, test or product (22/49, 45%), compared to stories covering common treatments or basic scientific research (5/97, 5%) (risk ratio, 8.72). Consistent with prior research on health science communication in other countries, we report undisclosed costs and risks, emphasized benefits, unrevealed financial conflicts of interest and exaggerated claims in Italian print media. In addition, we show that the risk for a story about a new medical approach to be unbalanced is almost 9 times higher with respect to stories about any other kind of health science-related topics. These findings raise again the fundamental issue whether popular media is detrimental rather than useful to public health.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Molecular feedback loops involving transcription and translation and several key genes are at the core of circadian regulatory cycles affecting cellular pathways and metabolism. These cycles are active in most adult animal cells but little is known about their expression or influence during development. To determine if circadian cycles are active during mammalian development we measured the expression of key circadian genes during embryogenesis in mice using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. All of the genes examined were expressed in whole embryos beginning at the earliest age examined, embryonic day 10. In contrast to adult tissues, circadian variation was absent for all genes at all of the embryonic ages examined in either whole embryos or individual tissues. Using a bioluminescent fusion protein that tracks translation of the circadian gene, per2, we also analyzed protein levels. Similar to mRNA, a protein rhythm was observed in adult tissue but not in embryonic tissues collected in-vivo. In contrast, when tissues were placed in culture for the continuous assay of bioluminescence, rhythms were observed in embryonic (E18) tissues. We found that placing embryonic tissues in culture set the timing (phase) of these rhythms, suggesting the importance of a synchronizing signal for the expression of circadian cycles in developing tissues. These results show that embryonic tissues express key circadian genes and have the capacity to express active circadian regulatory cycles. In vivo, circadian cycles are not expressed in embryonic tissues as they are in adult tissues. Individual cells might express oscillations, but are not synchronized until later in development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009876" title=""&gt;Citability of Original Research and Reviews in Journals and Their Sponsored Supplements&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The contents of pharmaceutical industry sponsored supplements to medical journals are perceived to be less credible than the contents of their parent journals. It is unknown if their contents are cited as often. The objective of this study was to quantify the citability of original research and reviews contained in supplements and compare it with that for the parent journal. This was a cohort study of 446 articles published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (JCP) and its supplements for calendar years 2000 and 2005. The total citation counts for each article up to October 5, 2009 were retrieved from the ISI Web of Science database. The main outcome measure was the number of citations received by an article since publication. Regular journal articles included 114 from calendar year 2000 and 190 from 2005. Articles from supplements included 90 from 2000 and 52 from 2005. The median citation counts for the 3 years post-publication were 10 (interquartile range [IQR], 4-20), 14 (IQR, 8-20), 13.5 (IQR, 8-23), and 13.5 (IQR, 8-20), for the 2000 parent journal, 2000 supplements, 2005 parent journal, and 2005 supplements, respectively. Citation counts were higher for the articles in the supplements than the parent journal for the cohorts from 2000 (p = .02), and no different for the year 2005 cohorts (p = .88). The 2005 parent journal cohort had higher citation counts than the 2000 cohort (p = .007), in contrast to the supplements where citation counts remained the same (p = .94). Articles published in JCP supplements are robustly cited and thus can be influential in guiding clinical and research practice, as well as shaping critical thinking. Because they are printed under the sponsorship of commercial interests, they may be perceived as less than objective. A reasonable step to help improve this perception would be to ensure that supplements are peer-reviewed in the same way as regular articles in the parent journal.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_264.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Attb9AjLeOc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269435810220"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=13019">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/55fd44433fac9902</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 3.24</title><published>2010-03-24T13:00:10Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T13:00:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/skepchick-quickies-3-24/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outspoken and hard-working Indian rationalist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanal_Edamaruku"&gt;Sanal Edamaruku&lt;/a&gt; had enough. When the &amp;quot;guru&amp;quot; Pandit Surender Sharma claimed he could kill a man using nothing but magic powers, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7067989.ece"&gt;Edamaruku challenged Sharma to kill him on live TV in India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, Sharma eventually agreed, and what played out on the air &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpwCuv_izn4"&gt;is pretty funny to watch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NpwCuv_izn4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26hd%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gee, this would’ve looked silly without the dramatic music.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My favorite part is Edamaruku constantly smiling and shaking his head, giving Sharma exactly what he deserves: derision. Still, millions of people  in India follow gurus like this purveyor of nonsense, so it’s serious business. I imagine that Sharma will lose exactly zero followers after this, given people’s ability to rationalize failure (not to be confused over &lt;em&gt;being rational&lt;/em&gt; about failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad that this guy was exposed on national TV in India, but I have to think that Mr. Edamaruku could’ve saved quite a bit of time and effort had he pointed out one simple thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this guy is so powerful, &lt;strong&gt;why does he wear glasses?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

In January I put &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/01/hoards_and_offerings.php"&gt;a couple of paragraphs&lt;/a&gt; up here about the possibly redundant distinction between retrievable hoards and irretrievable sacrifices. Here's some more, about ritual and rational behaviour.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ritual and rationality&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Richard Bradley has argued at length (1995), the distinction between ritual and domestic behaviour is not very helpful when dealing with prehistoric societies. One may easily think that "ritual" equals "irrational" and thus "functionally inexplicable". Conversely, "domestic" would then equal "functionalistic". But it must be remembered that it is impossible to be more rational than what your level of knowledge about the world allows. This has nothing to do with the once-fashionable epistemological relativism where there was talk of "different ways of knowing". Simply put, in the pre-scientific era that makes up almost the entire history of human culture, people did not know very well what was real and not. It was extremely difficult for them to determine what sort of actions would produce reliable effects. Most likely, all prehistoric action was &lt;i&gt;believed&lt;/i&gt; to be functional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everybody believes in the Lady in the Lake and atheism is unheard of, then it will appear entirely rational to make sacrifices to her. In fact, doing so may produce solidly beneficial effects - not thanks to any divine intervention, but because it impresses the neighbours. This view coexists easily with some level of modern-style economic rationality where rare imported goods such as bronze would be unusually valuable and prestigious and thus apt as sacrificial gifts. And conversely, it means that when we see evidence of people acting in mundane, sensible ways that we can easily explain from a modern functionalist perspective, then we are probably not dealing with behaviour that prehistoric people saw as belonging to any separate category of its own. If you really believe in gods, then sacrificing to them looks as sensible and/or ritual as digging deep post-holes to keep your house from collapsing. Prehistoric deposits look irrational to us just like today's best medical care will look irrational to future doctors who have access to therapies yet to be invented. Every age acts upon its best available knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own interpretation of why the deposits were made and left in place is that all were certainly left for reasons that appeared rational to people at the time, but that none, with very few exceptions, were left for reasons that make any functional sense to someone with a scientific world-view. A belief in the supernatural was clearly involved. We will most likely never know whether we would classify the fictional entities to which the sacrifices were directed as gods, demons, spirits or ancestors. But Tacitus tells us that people believed in gods in 1st century AD Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean written evidence for godly beliefs at the time of the Scandinavian Bronze Age is extensive indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have in fact yet to see a convincing argument for why we should interpret a given retrievable prehistoric metal hoard as mundane from a modern perspective. Christoph Huth (2009) makes the valuable point that the metal deposits of the Late Bronze Age and the Viking Period are similar in most respects but have been interpreted very differently. I agree, but while Huth hints that he favours a mercantile interpretation for both classes of finds, I instead hold the opposite view. Few Viking Period hoards were buried for mundane reasons and even fewer were allowed to remain underground for such reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note also that "irrational" does not have to mean "random", particularly when we consider that rational behaviour depends on your level of knowledge about the world. Rituals, while irrational to someone with a scientific world-view, are in fact anything but random. It is part of XXXX's influential definition of the term that a ritual is structured and proceeds according to certain rules that allows it to be repeated in a recognisable form. And for this reason, archaeologists should not dispense with the entire concept of ritual action. All human action was very likely perceived as rational. But much of it is nevertheless likely to have been ritualised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selective artefact deposition at specialised locations was part of South Scandinavian culture before, during and after the Bronze Age. We should thus understand it as a collective tradition that many or all people at the time knew about and chose to act upon for reasons they deemed important. From that perspective, I find the neo-Marxist interpretation once advanced by Kristian Kristiansen and others untenable. Kristiansen (REF) noted that the Bronze Age elite's position very likely rested on control of trade (be it mercantile or prestige gift-based) in scarce commodities, notably bronze. He pointed out that the system would break down and the elite lose their advantage if bronze became ubiquitous. And so he suggested that permanent deposition in wetlands was a way to keep the bronze supply down and ensure the continued scarcity - and value - of bronze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent deposition in lakes and rivers did of course have this effect on the economic system to some extent. But in my opinion it is out of the question that people had this goal in mind when they deposited bronze. Because to the &lt;i&gt;individual&lt;/i&gt; aristocrat who controlled bronze, scarcity was only desirable when it happened to somebody else. Nobody would ever let go of bronze for the common abstract good of the aristocratic system. And so the neo-Marxist model cannot explain the conscious reason that people chose to deposit bronze. And learning the conscious motivations of people in the past is in my opinion one of archaeology's prime objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps the most famous expression of distrust of a scientific consensus is the famous speech by Michael Crichton, in which &lt;a href="http://www.michaelcrichton.net/speech-alienscauseglobalwarming.html"&gt;he famously said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus. 

&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which I (and many others) responded, "Bullshit!

&lt;p&gt;This took place &lt;em&gt;yesterday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Lutheran church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much for a “harmless” Christian sect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://m.host.madison.com/mobile/article_932a56c8-36d4-11df-a17e-001cc4c03286.html"&gt;headline&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Baraboo church doesn’t let women speak or vote as school principal is fired&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="http://www.channel3000.com/news/22924665/detail.html"&gt;the story in a nutshell&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Women from St. John’s Lutheran Church said they want basic rights and that the lack of those rights is what led to the firing of the school’s principal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lutheran school’s principal, &lt;strong&gt;John Hartwig&lt;/strong&gt;, was fired on Sunday, mainly because of his beliefs that women should be respected more in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod Church…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the meeting to decide his fate, the women were commanded to shut up while the men voted to oust Hartwig 76-74.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church leaders argue that they weren’t disrespectful to women at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Women who wanted to ask questions at the meeting were told to write them on a piece of paper and have a man read them aloud. But some, including Hartwig’s own daughter, said their questions were never read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our congregational president was not trying to disrespect anyone. We have a wide number of households and a representative spiritual leadership of males who were asked to speak on behalf of their families so the meeting would not be over five hours,” said the Rev. Carl Schroeder, of St. John’s Lutheran Church, in the statement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because obviously women have no opinions of their own. They can only speak through a male translator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least a few of the women are coming to their senses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The women who didn’t have a voice at the meeting said they hope they’re heard loud and clear next year when they move their children to public school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re willing to take our money and take our time and ask us for more, but when it comes to our opinion, it’s not really needed,” [mother Julie] Cutrell said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if they knew the church’s policies were anti-women for so long, I wonder why they would enroll their children in the church-affiliated religious school in the first place — or even be part of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I’d be defending a principal who &lt;a href="http://www.stjohnsbaraboo.org/site/default.asp?sec_id=140003082"&gt;thinks he needs to&lt;/a&gt; “assist parents with their God-commanded responsibility to train their children in the truths of Scripture.”  But he got shafted by people even less rational than himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m waiting to hear other Christians denounce these people and their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s thought the mechanism may act to make our search of the visual scene more efficient by deterring us from looking at the same spot twice. Now Paul Skarratt and his colleagues have documented a new &amp;#39;social&amp;#39; form of inhibition of return, in which people are slower to attend to a location that social cues, such as gaze direction, suggest another person has already attended to.Twelve participants sat at a table with an animated character projected opposite. Each participant and their animated partner had two lights and two buttons in front of them, near the middle of the table (see figure above). One light/button pair was to the left, the other pair was to the right. The basic task was to press the corresponding button as fast as possible when it&amp;#39;s light came on. Participants were slower to respond to a light when the animated partner had just responded to the adjacent light on their side of the table - this is what you might call a weak version of social inhibition of return. However, when two large vertical barriers were put up with a gap in the middle, so that the participants could only see their partner&amp;#39;s eyes and initial reaching action, and not their actual button presses, this social IoR disappeared.In a second experiment, the animated partner was replaced with a human. This time, the social IoR effect occurred even when the barriers were erected and only the partner&amp;#39;s eye gaze and initial hand movement could be seen. In other words, inferences about where the partner was going to attend, based on their eyes or early hand movement, seemed to be enough to inhibit a participant&amp;#39;s own attention to the same location. For some reason, this strong version of social IoR only occurred with a real, human partner, not the animated, computer-controlled partner of the first experiment. The final experiment added yet another visual barrier, which left only the partner&amp;#39;s eyes or only their early hand movement visible. This was to try to establish which cue was the more important for provoking social IoR. The answer was that both cues were equally effective. It&amp;#39;s only supposition at this stage, but Skarratt and his team think social IoR could be supported by the postulated mirror neuron system. Monkey research has shown, for example, that there are mirror neurons in the premotor cortex that fire whether a monkey sees another person grasp an object or if they just see the initial part of that grasping movement.&amp;#39;Although the critical mechanisms underlying social IoR remain to be discovered,&amp;#39; the researchers said, &amp;#39;the current study indicates that it can be generated independently of direct sensory stimulation normally associated with IoR, and can occur instead on the basis of an inference of another person&amp;#39;s behaviour.&amp;#39;_________________________________Skarratt, P., Cole, G., &amp;amp; Kingstone, A.

Genomicus is a great tool to visualize gene duplication, synteny and  genome evolution. The search and display interfaces are quite straightforward, and there are lots of great features (viewing ancestral gene information, links out to resources, different views of phylogenies, etc) in the tool. This video is only a short introduction. You can delve deeper into the tool with the help and documentation, including an 11 minute video.

There is also a recent (advance access) paper in the journal “Bioinformatics” that will give you a lot more detail on how the database and tool works and what is there.

This article first appeared on &lt;a href="http://startswithabang.com/?p=1486"&gt;my old website&lt;/a&gt;, back in February of 2009.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some days the questions I get are easy, and some days I get questions from our longtime reader, Ben. This past week, there have been reports all over the news that &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126911.300-our-world-may-be-a-giant-hologram.html?full=true"&gt;our world may be a giant hologram&lt;/a&gt;. Let's take a look at what's going on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/geo600-detector.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/geo600-detector-thumb-500x341-43183.jpg" width="500" height="341" alt="geo600-detector.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hanover, Germany, there's an experiment called GEO600. These are two perpendicular lasers, and they shoot out for thousands of feet, get reflected, and come back to their original location to make an interference pattern.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/05_03.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/05_03-thumb-500x426-43185.jpg" width="500" height="426" alt="05_03.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the reason this is important is because gravitational waves cause ripples in space in a certain way. These perpendicular lasers are particularly sensitive to what gravitational waves do, and the interference pattern will shift in a very particular way if gravitational waves pass through them. This is the same idea that's behind the upcoming &lt;a href="http://lisa.nasa.gov/"&gt;LISA&lt;/a&gt; mission.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/gravitational_waves1_4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/gravitational_waves1_4-thumb-500x373-43187.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="gravitational_waves1_4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, GEO600, like every laser interferometer we've ever built, has not seen any evidence for gravitational waves. But it has seen something that it can't explain, and that's always interesting for an experiment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It found some extra noise, above and beyond what can be predicted/explained by things like the vibrations of the Earth, temperature fluctuations, or instrumental noise. What does this look like? Whenever you do your experiment, you do your best to understand what noise you expect to see, and then you look for deviations from this. GEO600 saw something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/img35.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/img35-thumb-500x362-43189.gif" width="500" height="362" alt="img35.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are two possibilities now: either there's a source of noise they haven't figured out, or something physically interesting and novel is causing this. Now, historically, whenever experiments are done, it's almost always unexpected noise that causes something like this to happen. But once in awhile, there really is a new effect that we have going on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It's very important to state, clearly and unambiguously, before we go any further, that this may simply turn out to be noise. This may not be a physical effect at all, and that no other similar experiments (such as &lt;a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/"&gt;LIGO&lt;/a&gt;) see these effects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if it is a physical effect, &lt;a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/people/craig-hogan.shtml"&gt;Craig Hogan&lt;/a&gt; of Fermilab has come up with an extremely interesting possible explanation. He says that this excess noise could be a sign that our Universe &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cf.ac.uk/newsandevents/?page=news_detail&amp;amp;news=0030"&gt;has an extra dimension&lt;/a&gt; to it. How does this work? Let's think of a hologram:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/hologram-16.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/hologram-16-thumb-500x500-43191.gif" width="500" height="500" alt="hologram-16.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hologram has all the information you could ever want about the dimensions of a 3-D object, but it has it all in two dimensions. For instance, you could tell some object's (or someone's) length, width, and depth just from looking at a 2-D hologram. All of the information is encoded in there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/star-wars-hologram.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/star-wars-hologram-thumb-500x408-43195.jpg" width="500" height="408" alt="star-wars-hologram.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, our Universe may be the same exact way. We know about our 3 space dimensions and our 1 time dimension. But we may have more dimensions of space than we know about; many interesting theories have them. One possible consequence is that these extra dimensions could cause extra "blurring" of our 3 regular space dimensions at very small lengths.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/bmw-blur.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/is_the_universe_a_giant_hologr/bmw-blur-thumb-500x373-43193.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="bmw-blur.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is very interesting, because the noise we see in the GEO600 experiment causes the laser light to blur on scales of about 10&lt;sup&gt;-16&lt;/sup&gt; meters and below. This is smaller than the size of a single proton, but amazingly, our technology is sensitive enough that we can detect it! But is this blurring due to extra dimensions? Let's see what the people connected with the experiment say about Craig Hogan's idea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;However Danzmann is cautious about Hogan's proposal and believes more theoretical work needs to be done. "It's intriguing," he says. "But it's not really a theory yet, more just an idea." Like many others, Danzmann agrees it is too early to make any definitive claims. "Let's wait and see," he says. "We think it's at least a year too early to get excited."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The longer the puzzle remains, however, the stronger the motivation becomes to build a dedicated instrument to probe holographic noise. John Cramer of the University of Washington in Seattle agrees. It was a "lucky accident" that Hogan's predictions could be connected to the GEO600 experiment, he says. "It seems clear that much better experimental investigations could be mounted if they were focused specifically on the measurement and characterisation of holographic noise and related phenomena."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So it looks like this is worth further investigation, but it's way too early to draw any definitive conclusions. But it's a possibility, and for something as grand as this, for something that would forever change the way we view our Universe, I think it's worth investigating further, and so does the entire GEO600 team.

Actually, aside from a few needlessly drawn out stories that go nowhere, Jean Houston was almost nonexistent in this debate and I almost even liked her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real debate though was between Sam Harris and Michael Shermer against Deepak Chopra, who couldn’t have made more of a fool of himself. Even a guy in the audience during the Q &amp;amp; A session exposed Chopra’s ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common theme in the debate seemed to be exposing Deepak as hack who incorrectly co-opts terminology from both science and religion in order to formulate his own brand of meaningless New Age gibberish. The debate was about whether or not the god concept has a future and Deepak refused to actually address the very topic he was invited to discuss, ignoring the god concept that 99.999999% of the world means when they talk about god in order to promote his own “god” in name only that has no resemblance to what almost everyone on the planet would consider “god.” So then why did you agree to the debate in the first place, Deepak?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is like if I were invited to debate free will versus determinism and instead demanded that we discuss homeopathy, which I renamed “determinism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepak was also frequently corrected on his constant misuse of quantum physics as a justification for his incoherent magical claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it’s a fun debate to watch, so check it out. Here’s the first part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/sam-harris-michael-shermer-crush-deepak-chopra-jean-houston-on-nightline/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/6-8-Yxdphsg/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and check out Shermer’s post-debate debate with Chopra &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/03/23/does-the-moon-exist/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. No, I didn’t accidentally type “debate” twice. Chopra and Shermer have continued debating a particularly idiotic claim Chopra made on their blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is an exceptionally fat bird (a good-sized adult weighs roughly two or three kilograms) and its wings are just about good enough to waggle about a bit if it thinks it’s going to trip over. But flying is completely out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, not only has it forgotten how to fly, it also seems to have forgotten that it has forgotten how to fly. Legend has it that a seriously worried kakapo will sometimes run up a tree and jump out of it, whereupon it flies like a brick and lands in a graceless heap on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kakapos are highly endangered, with only about 60 remaining in the wild (read about them &lt;a href="http://www.kakapo.net/en/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and they’ve been transferred to two islands to remove them from introduced predators, like cats, who can easily catch these tubby, flightless birds. (Remember that they evolved flightlessness when New Zealand was free from predators.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s a randy male kakapo (“Sirocco”: there are so few that they’ve all been named) mistaking a photographer—zoologist Mark Carwardine—for another kakapo. Stephen Fry stands by and describes the unholy act. This is from the wonderful BBC film, “Last chance to see.”&lt;/p&gt;

From the International Journal of Obesity:&amp;quot;Portion sizes of foods have been noticably increasing in recent years,  but when did this trend begin? If art imitates life and if food portions  have been generally increasing with time, we might expect this trend to  be reflected in paintings that depict food. Perhaps the most commonly  painted meal has been that of Jesus Christ&amp;#39;s Last Supper, chronicled in  the New Testament of the Bible. A CAD–CAM analysis of the relative  food-to-head ratio in 52 representative paintings of the Last Supper  showed that the relative sizes of the main dish, bread, and  plates  have linearly increased over the past millennium.&amp;quot;First, it&amp;#39;s spelled noticeably, not noticably. No need to thank me, I&amp;#39;m just here to help.Lead author, Brian Wansink, proudly displayed his virginity by saying, &amp;quot;I think people assume that increased serving sizes, or ‘portion  distortion,’ is a recent phenomenon, but this research  indicates that it’s a general trend for at least the last millennium.&amp;quot;His brother Craig Wansink, proving that mental illness does run in their family added, &amp;quot;As the most famously depicted dinner of all time, the Last Supper is  ideally suited for review.&amp;quot;Here is a graph showing some of the data that will one day lead to a vaccination for jock itch.   I am posting another graph below because I hate all of you.  What they found was that &amp;quot;the main courses depicted in the  paintings grew by 69%, plate size by  66%, and bread size by 23%&amp;quot; over the course of 1000 years. I&amp;#39;ve lost precious minutes from my life.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every week, I go and debate with spokesmen of religious faith. Invariably and without exception, they inform me that without a belief in supernatural authority I would have no basis for my morality. Yet here is an ancient Christian church that deals in awful certainties when it comes to outright condemnation of sins like divorce, abortion, contraception, and homosexuality between consenting adults. For these offenses there is no forgiveness, and moral absolutism is invoked. Yet let the subject be the rape and torture of defenseless children, and at once every kind of wiggle room and excuse-making is invoked. What can one say of a church that finds so much latitude for a crime so ghastly that no morally normal person can even think of it without shuddering? . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . Meanwhile, we should register the fact that the church can find ample room in its confessionals and its palaces for those who commit the most evil offense of all. Whether prosecuted or not, they stand condemned. But prosecution must follow, or else we admit that there are men and institutions that are above and beyond our laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been following the websites this week, but have Catholic bloggers like Andrew Sullivan—or for that matter those ScienceBlogs writers who profess both Catholicism and concern for social justice—said anything about this scandal?&lt;/p&gt;

Sauropodomorphs are (mostly) herbivorous dinosaurs that lived from the Triassic all the way until the end of the Cretaceous. Although most people know the giant quadrupedal sauropodomorphs like Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus ("Brontosaurus"), many of the early sauropodomorphs were bipeds smaller than humans. Seitaad fits in the latter category. For reasons explained below, this is a really cool little animal and a truly rare find.I have a personal connection to this fossil on two levels. First, the authors of the article, Joe Sertich (at left, pictured with the specimen) and Mark Loewen, are good friends and colleagues of mine. So, I was really excited when they told me that they wanted to submit their manuscript to PLoS ONE (full disclosure: I am an editor there; for obvious reasons, someone else handled their submission). I'll confess that I did little to discourage them. Congratulations, Joe and Mark, on a great paper!Second, I was one of the lucky people who got to carry the block containing Seitaad from its original resting place, way back in 2005. This thing was heavy! It took a crew of 12 people (7 carrying at a time, and 5 resting for rotation back in) to haul it out. After several years of preparation and study, the new animal is finally named!I queried one of Seitaad's authors, Mark Loewen, for his thoughts on the find (Joe Sertich is out of the country, so wasn't able to contribute). Here's what Mark had to say.Briefly, what is the most significant aspect of the new find reported in PLoS ONE?Seitaad is the first dinosaur discovered from the Navajo Sandstone of Utah and one of the oldest known dinosaurs from Utah. The Navajo Sandstone is a dominant rock unit exposed all over the west. . .and is hiked by thousands of people every year. Fossils in this formation are extremely rare. Prior to its discovery our entire view of the fauna of the Navajo consisted of a partial tritylodont, three chunks of crocodylomorphs, parts of a small theropod, [and] two fragmentary sauropodomorphs. Seitaad is the most complete fossil from the Navajo and through comparisons with taxa across the world gives a much better picture of the largest herbivore in the sand seas of western North America at the same time that large true sauropods had evolved in other parts of the world.How did you choose the name that you did?Seitaad was found by Joe Pachak [pictured at left, with the specimen], a local archaeologist and artist from Bluff, Utah while hiking Comb Ridge to document petroglyphs and pictographs. He reported the specimen to the BLM, who alerted us at the Utah Museum of Natural History. We went down to check it out, and immediately started to excavate the specimen. With a crew of 12, including Andy Farke, we hauled out the jackets and began preparing them at the UMNH.The area around Comb Ridge is covered with numerous archaeological sites and cliff dwellings from the ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) culture. In fact, Seitaad was located directly below a dwelling called the Eagles Nest. The people who lived in the area at the time would have recognized the white bones of Seitaad eroding out of the cliff if they had seen them. A nearby cliff dwelling has a slab with a dinosaur track incorporated into the window sill. I’m confident that the person who [put] this stone into the window had awareness and appreciation for the fossils preserved in the Four Corners region."Seitaad" is derived from Seit’aad, a sand-desert monster from the Navajo (Diné) creation legend that swallowed its victims in sand dunes. The skeleton of Seitaad had been "swallowed" by a fossilized sand dune. The [species name] "ruessi" is derived from Everett Ruess, the famous young artist, poet, historian, and explorer who disappeared in southern Utah in 1934. Ruess is celebrated for his love of the region, its people, and for his free-spirited and adventurous lifestyle. Everett Ruess loved the red rock country of Utah and spent a lot of time exploring the Navajo Formation, so we thought it was fitting to honor him in the taxonomic name.Why did you choose PLoS ONE as a venue for your research?We chose to submit to PLoS ONE for several reasons. The open-access format of PLoS ONE and rapid turn-around were major factors. Another factor was the opportunity to reach a broader audience and the rising impact and recognition of PLoS ONE within the paleontology academic community. Another consideration was the lack of limits to figures and unrestricted use of color. The unlimited use of color became a concern during the preparation of our manuscript, when it became clear that black and white photos were not revealing proper contrast between white bones of Seitaad and the pink sandstone of the Navajo Formation.Is there anything about this find that didn't make it into the scientific paper? When we first saw photos of the skeleton in the cliff wall we thought it was a pterosaur. The v-shaped ischia looked like dentaries. It wasn’t until UMNH preparators got into the block that we changed our identification to theropod. Then when we got to the hand, we know from the thumb claw that it was a sauropodomorph.Mark Loewen with the skeleton of Seitaad ruessi***************Check out the original article for free at the PLoS ONE website.

At the very least, some hooligan pulled a fire alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the proper way to handle kooks at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is a vile lunatic, but she should have been given the right to speak, and &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; her noise should have been ripped apart with good questions, and conversation after the event. It's pretty much guaranteed that she would have said things that are &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/03/canada-did-not-send-troops-to-vietnam.html"&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200412010011"&gt;outrageous&lt;/a&gt; and embarrassed herself — not that she&amp;#39;d notice, since she&amp;#39;s shameless — but now she gets a free pass and a martyr card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may be wrong here. If there &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; violence, or a credible threat of violence, then it was a bad show for free speech. On the other hand, it&amp;#39;s looking like there really wasn&amp;#39;t any serious threat — it was just a loud mob of people peacefully protesting, of which I entirely approve. The &amp;#39;violence&amp;#39; story is beginning to sound like a contrived excuse for Ann Coulter to bolt out of the hot seat.&lt;/p&gt;

He shouldn't be welcomed; he should be turned away at the border as an undesirable fraud. There is a &lt;a href="http://www.protest-the-pope.org.uk/"&gt;petition to sign&lt;/a&gt; to let the government know what people think. They make a good case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;That the Pope, as a citizen of Europe and the leader of a religion with many adherents in the UK, is of course free to enter and tour our country.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;However, as well as a religious leader, the Pope is a head of state and the state and organisation of which he is head has been responsible for:
&lt;ol&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;opposing the distribution of condoms and so increasing large families in poor countries and the spread of AIDS&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;promoting segregated education&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;denying abortion to even the most vulnerable women&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;opposing equal rights for lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender people&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;failing to address the many cases of abuse of children within its own organisation.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;rehabilitating the holocaust denier bishop Richard Williamson and the appeaser of Hitler, the war-time Pope, Pius XII.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;The state of which the Pope is the head has also resisted signing many major human rights treaties and has formed its own treaties (‘concordats’) with many states which negatively affect the human rights of citizens of those states.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;As a head of state, the Pope is an unsuitable guest of the UK government and should not be accorded the honour and recognition of a state visit to our country.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That first point is far too kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/say_no_to_that_old_rascal_pope.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/BYj0Hu2EFDE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269395766344"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/its_just_not_worth_doing_if_de.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be797a51d9f20518</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">It's just not worth doing if Deepak Chopra is involved</title><published>2010-03-24T00:55:26Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T00:55:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/rJIS-VVusdY/its_just_not_worth_doing_if_de.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/its_just_not_worth_doing_if_de.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don't watch this &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/FaceOff/nightline-face-off-god-future/story?id=10170505"&gt;debate on "Does God have a future?"&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/FaceOff/"&gt;video here&lt;/a&gt;) if your temper runs a bit hot. Sam Harris was excellent, Michael Shermer was pretty good, but their opponents, Deepak Chopra and Jean Houston, were blithering morons. Harris's early point was spot on: that there is the kind of religion that people actually practice, and then there is the New Age woo of cosmic minds and magic powers gussied up with pseudo-scientific noise, and the latter is a dodge to avoid the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that's all Chopra did: he babbled about &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt;, of all things, supporting his flaky freakish New Age scam, and Houston was also pointless in a lot of pretentious touchy-feely vapidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just isn&amp;#39;t worth it. I think we&amp;#39;re at the point where no godless rationalist ought to share a stage with Chopra — he&amp;#39;s an ignorant phony who will simply lie and misrepresent science while claiming its mantle. Both Harris and Shermer were solid in standing up to him, but they didn&amp;#39;t go far enough in dismissing his phony credentials and his dishonest schtick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/its_just_not_worth_doing_if_de.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/rJIS-VVusdY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269394641440"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=4973">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/393c3c42a013f0d9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random"/><category term="Home Disasters"/><category term="poetry"/><category term="poe"/><category term="the raven"/><category term="parody"/><title type="html">With Apology to Edgar Allen Poe</title><published>2010-03-24T01:37:09Z</published><updated>2010-03-24T01:37:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/with-apology-to-edgar-allen-poe/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; The Raven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,&lt;br&gt;
Over many a quaint and curious volume of entomological lore,&lt;br&gt;
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping–&lt;br&gt;
Something crap, crap, crapping in my bedroom wall.&lt;br&gt;
‘Tis the wind ,’ I muttered, Only this, and nothing more.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep into the darkness peering, long I laid there wondering, fearing,&lt;br&gt;
Doubting, dreaming damage I never dared to dream before.&lt;br&gt;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token&lt;br&gt;
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, `Squirrel!’&lt;br&gt;
Merely this and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back into my bedclothes turning, all my soul within me burning,&lt;br&gt;
Soon again I heard a scratching somewhat louder than before.&lt;br&gt;
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore; -&lt;br&gt;
‘Tis the wind and nothing more!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off I flung the covers, when, with many a fart and flutter,&lt;br&gt;
I smelled a stately squirrel of the saintly days of yore.&lt;br&gt;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;&lt;br&gt;
But, with mien of lord or lady, scratched above my bedroom door -&lt;br&gt;
Perched, and shat, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the squirrel, never flitting, still is shitting, still is shitting&lt;br&gt;
In the gap within the wall above my bedroom door;&lt;br&gt;
And his toenails have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,&lt;br&gt;
And my sleep beneath that shadow that lies scratching in the wall&lt;br&gt;
Shall be uninterrupted – nevermore!&lt;/p&gt;

But the innate immune system also becomes damaged and dysfunctional with age. Here is a quick summary of the functional difference between these two components of the immune system: The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. Most simply, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a third layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered. In short, the innate immune system responds the same way......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The aim of this seminar was to formulate a theory that would explain to a Martian "what it is that we know when we know a language." I could not imagine a more objectless, melancholy project. The solution turned out to consist of a series of propositions having the form "'Snow is white' is true if snow is white." The professor, a gaunt logician with a wild mane of red hair, wrote this sentence on the board during nearly every class, and we would discuss why it wasn't trivial. Outside the window, snow piled deeper and deeper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;By contrast with the philosophy of language and my other classes in psycholinguistics, syntax, and phonetics, beginning Russian struck me as profoundly human. I had expected linguistics (the general study of language) to resemble a story, and Russian (the study of a particular language) to resemble a set of rules, but the reality was just the opposite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2010/janfeb/show/batuman.html"&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt; Batuman was an undergraduate at Harvard, so some people whose 02138-ology is more current than mine should be able to decode the identity of that gaunt logician.  Good academic gossip, I guess, but I don't care much (although I do wonder what department (s)he was in).  Rather, I'm interested in the idea that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_theory_of_truth"&gt;Tarski's theory of truth&lt;/a&gt; should be the critical factor in a young woman's decision to abandon linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski/"&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Alfred Tarski (1901–1983) described himself as "a mathematician (as well as a logician, and perhaps a philosopher of a sort)" (1944, p. 369). He is widely considered as one of the greatest logicians of the twentieth century (often regarded as second only to Gödel), and thus as one of the greatest logicians of all time. Among philosophers he is especially known for his mathematical characterizations of the concepts of truth and logical consequence for sentences of classical formalized languages, and to a lesser extent for his mathematical characterization of the concept of a logical constant for expressions of those same languages. Among logicians and mathematicians he is in addition famous for his work on set theory, model theory and algebra, which includes results and developments such as the Banach-Tarski paradox, the theorem on the indefinability of truth (see section 2 below), the completeness and decidability of elementary algebra and geometry, and the notions of cardinal, ordinal, relation and cylindric algebras.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003225.html"&gt;often&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LSATalk.pdf"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; about the fact that linguistics as an academic discipline formed late, left with scraps from the table of many already well-established fields: anthropology, education, literary studies, classical and modern languages, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, speech pathology, and so on.  For both external and internal reasons, the field has tended to accept a narrow definition of its scope, at the same time as many other fields (especially anthropology and language departments) have largely lost interest in linguistic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In philosophy, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_turn"&gt;"linguistic turn"&lt;/a&gt; (which Tarski took part in) was given that name &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GLeoB6J7TEkC&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;pg=PA3-IA4#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;only on its tombstone&lt;/a&gt;, so to speak. When language was at the center of philosophy, for better or for worse, linguistics as an academic field got little or no bureaucratic benefit.  Now the philosophers' focus has mostly shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the only time (as far as I can tell) that the Chronicle of Higher Education has ever referred to Tarski, he's the intellectual bad guy in an anecdote about abandoning linguistics for literary studies.

&lt;p&gt;And there are times when sarcasm is so much more entertaining…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, public school chaplains don’t exist but “Christian volunteers” are permissible.  It’s a loophole.  Still, &lt;strong&gt;Darryl Robinson&lt;/strong&gt; identified himself as a “school chaplain” and &lt;a href="http://www.27bslash6.com/easter.html"&gt;sent home this letter&lt;/a&gt; to a student’s father, &lt;strong&gt;David Thorne&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.27bslash6.com/easter.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.27bslash6.com/images/chaplain_letter.jpg" title="ChaplainLetter" width="350" height="485"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thorne had a &lt;a href="http://www.27bslash6.com/easter.html"&gt;very amusing, snark-laden exchange&lt;/a&gt; with Robinson — it’s several emails long, but well worth the read.  Good luck reading it without cracking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.27bslash6.com/easter.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/EasterEmail.png" alt="" title="EasterEmail" width="359" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcasm aside, Robinson deserved it.  There’s no reason people like him should be advocating religious superstition for grade school children too young to be critical of it.  This is pure proselytization and it’s a waste of time. No rational parent should stand for it.&lt;/p&gt;

The primary structure is the arrangements of atoms and bonds, and it is formed in the ribosome by the assembly of amino acids as directed by an RNA template. The secondary structure is the local topology, the helices and strands, and this forms mostly because of the release of energy through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The tertiary structure is the actual fold of the protein, the way helices, strands, and loops are arranged in space. The fold forms primarily because of the favorable entropy of burying the protein&amp;#39;s hydrophobic groups where water cannot access them, analogous to the formation of an oil droplet in water. This suggests that, in addition to the well-known phenomenon of proteins denaturing, or losing their higher-order structure, under conditions of high heat, proteins might also denature when they get too cold.

As you might remember from your chemistry classes, the change in free energy due to a reaction under conditions of constant pressure is given by:ΔG = ΔH - T ΔSWhere ΔH is the change in enthalpy (i.e. the heat released or absorbed by a reaction), ΔS is the change in entropy, and T is the temperature of the system in Kelvin. Here, the change we are talking about is the transition from the folded state to some unfolded state. Simplistically, since the entropic contribution is scaled by the temperature, one can imagine that for a reaction with favorable entropy and unfavorable enthalpy, lowering the temperature could cause the reaction to reverse. Protein folding is only marginally favorable at biological temperatures, so one could easily imagine that lowering the temperature enough could cause a protein to prefer the unfolded state.

Of course, this is an oversimplification: the entropy and enthalpy of a particular protein state do not remain constant over all temperatures. Rather, they vary in a way determined by the heat capacity (Cp), such that ΔG as a function of temperature is (1):ΔG(T) = ΔH(Tr) + ΔCp(T-Tr) - T [ΔS(Tr) + ΔCp ln(T/Tr)]Where Tr is some reference state at which the thermodynamic parameters have been determined, and ΔCp is defined with respect to the native (folded) state. Because the various states of the protein have different Cp (unfolded chains typically have higher Cp), at certain temperatures above and below the biological optimum we can expect proteins to lose their higher levels of structure. Even this is still an oversimplification, of course, because it does not directly account for changes in water structure and cosolute properties with temperature. These features may cause ΔCp itself to vary with temperature rather than remain constant.

Unfortunately, for most proteins the temperature that favors unfolding lies below the freezing point of water, which makes this phenomenon difficult to study unless you do something unusual to your system. In 2004, Babu et al. (1) reported results from experiments that used reverse micelles to study the denaturation of ubiquitin at temperatures below freezing. By encapsulating a protein-water droplet in inverted micelles dissolved in pentane, it was possible to reduce the temperature to 243 K without causing freezing. These micelles also had the convenient property of tumbling quickly in the pentane, which allowed for reasonable NMR spectra even at these low temperatures. The appearance of the spectra they obtained indicated that the protein underwent a slow unfolding process with many different unfolded states, and also that the protein did not unfold in a cooperative fashion. Rather, it appeared that one contiguous region of the protein unfolded while the rest remained folded (the main helix was particularly stable).

This wasn&amp;#39;t expected, because ubiquitin apparently unfolds in a completely two-state manner when overheated. This being the case, what&amp;#39;s expected is for the protein to either be all folded or all unfolded, not some mixture of the two. However, cold does not affect all intramolecular contacts the same way. Lowering the temperature is expected to make hydrophobic interactions less favorable while not significantly affecting polar interactions like hydrogen bonds. This being the case, one might expect an α-helix to persist through a cold-denaturation transition, as happens in this case.

Something similar is observed in an upcoming paper in JACS from the Raleigh and Eliezer Labs (2), which approaches cold denaturation using a mutant form of the C-terminal domain of ribosomal protein L9. An isoleucine to alanine mutation at residue 98 of this domain doesn&amp;#39;t appear to significantly alter the structure, but it causes the protein to denature somewhere in the high teens. At 12 °C the unfolded state is about 80% of the visible population, and this is where Shan et al. performed their NMR experiments. They assigned the unfolded state using standard techniques and then decided to see what they could learn from the chemical shifts.

As I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, the chemical shift of a nucleus depends on the probability distribution of the surrounding electrons, and therefore is sensitive to the strength, composition, and angles of the atom&amp;#39;s chemical bonds. Because the dihedral angles of the protein backbone are a good proxy for the secondary structure, one can use the chemical shifts of particular atoms to determine whether a given residue is in a helix or strand. When they performed this analysis, Shan et al. noticed two major differences between the native and cold-denatured states of the protein. The first was that the helix and strand propensities of the denatured protein were much lower than the folded form, as expected. In addition, however, they noticed that one loop of the protein had gained α-helical character. That is, it seemed like an α-helix had actually gotten longer as a result of the unfolding.

This doesn&amp;#39;t mean that denaturing the protein added secondary structure. The low values in the output from the algorithm Shan et al. used suggest that the secondary structure in this denatured state forms only transiently. However, the chemical shifts suggest, and other structural data appear to confirm, that this region of the protein has an increased propensity to inhabit a helical structure as a consequence of the unfolding.

These results emphasize the fact that the &amp;quot;unfolded state&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t as simple as it&amp;#39;s often described. Residual structure persists in unfolded states of many proteins, and unfolded ensembles of one protein generated through different means (heat, cold, pH, cosolutes) may not resemble each other. Unlike unfolding at high temperature, cold denaturation of ubiquitin appears to be non-cooperative. In both ubiquitin and L9, it appears that helices are robust to the unfolding process, persisting and even propagating as the protein denatures. While some of these features may be held in common between different kinds of denatured states, others may be unique to particular denaturation conditions. The lingering question is which of these unfolded ensembles best resembles the denatured state that exists under biological conditions, giving rise to misfolded states and their associated diseases.

They had a huge yellow carpet (instead of red, clever stuff) all the way up to the theatre, with people-you’ve-seen-on-telly walking up it, fans and photographers screaming over the barriers. Except when I walked up the carpet with the friend who had invited me, total silence. And we were the only VIPs MTV didn’t interview, with the exception of the competition winners and ‘some kid in a wheelchair’. Feh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is meant to be a review of &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;. Because IANARMR (I Am Not A Real Movie Reviewer) I am allowed to jump to the ‘five stars’ conclusion, which I already did in the first paragraph with my declaration of AWESOME. You can stop reading here or skip to the bit with swearing in, or bear with me. I promise no spoilers, except they all die at the end when aliens arrive and the bad guy turns out to be the hero’s father who can be thwarted by water. Other than that, no spoilers. Oh, and the main dude is really a woman. A ghost woman.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started with an obnoxious tone, which suits me and suits this review because &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt; is precisely that. It’s obnoxious, it has brightly-coloured hairy balls, and it has a young girl swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swearing is not big, and it’s not clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is fucking funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain British tabloids have their knickers in a twist over the script, in a spectacular yet utterly predictable display of MISSING THE SHITTING POINT. One assumes they haven’t seen the film, because if they had they’d realise that the kid swears because she’s doing adult things like killing, maiming, revengening (that is a word) and generally punctuating her proxy-wrath with &lt;em&gt;appropriate&lt;/em&gt; pronouncements. No-one (sane) in the movie says it’s OK for a young girl to kill or use the C-word. Someone in the movie quite clearly states it is wrong and that she is being robbed of her innocent childhood. This is, remember, a comic book movie, and although it starts with the illusion of the real world, asking why real people don’t become superheroes, it’s clear that the morality is firmly in black and white, good and evil absolutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to anyone who accuses &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt; of cheap tricks or sensationalism: you’re wrong, douche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, I didn’t need to add the “douche” in there, but like I say, swearing is funny. So fuck it. The kid needs to swear because what else would you say as you’re cutting off a drug dealers’ legs? I found her far more of a parallel – an exaggerated expression of innocence-turned-manipulated-by-fate-superhero – to traditional heroes like Spider-Man, Batman (whose entire motivation has foundations in revenge), and a gajillion others, than the main hero of the movie, regular teenage kid Dave Lizewski&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who one day simply decides to fight crime. Actually, his motives are deeper than boredom, but I promised no spoilers and I certainly wouldn’t want to suggest the hero had run out of wanking material and has a fetish for Neoprene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Britain we have a product called Marmite, which uses ‘you either love it or hate it’ as a strapline, mainly because it’s true. Marmite is divisive and lazy reviewers might be tempted to use that as a hackneyed metaphor for &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;. Not me, though. I’d use that for &lt;em&gt;Napoleon Dynamite&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt; is more like something that you start and enjoy straight away and then don’t realise you’ve been enjoying for two hours, then when it’s over you want more and leave with a really happy and excited feeling in your belly. Like…er…like a really great movie. And if you think that I’m being too positive and gushing, guess again. &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt; has some really hokey product placement moments that took me right out of the movie and into the nearest Virgin Media outlet to sign up for their amazing mobile phone deals! But even though that’s the only criticism I have, I still need to point out that it’s an independent movie and if selling a few moments of screen time pays for a few special effects or extra marketing, then I can live with it (and Virgin’s incredible deals on call time and texts!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck alive. How much do movie reviewers get paid again? Honestly, this is really hard. Funny, violent, touching, clever, adjectives and clichés abound but they’re all fitting. I do have a bunch more to add, like “you will love this even if you haven’t read the comic book” and “take your partner even if they don’t fancy it because it really is not just for comic book fans” and “the comic book is good but the movie is better, and anyway I prefer some of Mark Millar’s other comics like &lt;em&gt;The Ultimates&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Marvel 1985&lt;/em&gt;, although the latter isn’t as good as Neil Gaiman’s &lt;em&gt;Marvel 1602&lt;/em&gt; but get both cause Amazon is having a sale on graphic novels”. Y’know, background stuff to give depth and gravitas to my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah fuck it, just go and see &lt;em&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;. If you don’t like it I won’t call you a cunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tracy’s Movie Review Disclaimer: my opinions are not more valid than anyone else’s, so please don’t go see or be put off seeing Kick-Ass because of anything you read here. I am just some opinionated jerk who has seen a lot of movies and read a lot of comics and therefore thinks that qualifies her to publish her thoughts. My thoughts on this movie and every other do happen to be correct, but really, don’t let that influence you. I’m no-one.  IANARMR. Honestly. Did I mention I cried at the end of Jumanji and bought Showgirls on DVD? See, I’m no-one. PS, I was kidding about Virgin Media, I use their broadband and it’s shit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;</content><author><name>Tracy King</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269382712205"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13159">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0d7fbd969ca6730</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Christopher Lee"/><category term="The Jabberwocky"/><title type="html">The very definition of awesome.

Please read about his plan to bring a skeptical perspective to the freaks'n'geeks of Indiana, and consider helping out. Danke. - BKT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen Con is coming to Indiana from August 5-8, a Thursday through a Sunday. It's an enormous convention ostensibly oriented toward gaming (pen and paper RPGs, tabletop games, wargames, etc.), but in reality serving just about every aspect of geek, nerd, and dork culture: comic books, sci-fi/fantasy, anime, video games, board games, card games. You name it, Gen Con has it. It's roughly equivalent to a midwestern Dragon*Con, and pretty much the same size, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guerrilla skeptical symposium (“symposiums” are Gen Con's equivalent of Dragon*Con's "tracks") is so-called because those of us working on it have been doing it from the bottom up with no official recognition (as yet) from Gen Con itself. It started back in 2008, when some friends and I attended and sat through a panel by the Indiana Ghost Trackers called “The Science of EVP.” Suffice to say, it wasn't worth the price (free) and, after a few polite but pointed questions about the nature of their research, we decided that 2009 would see a skeptical response. We organized a panel called “Skepticism, Critical Thinking, and Pop Culture,” and spent a couple of hours riffing on logical fallacies, alternative medicine, the antivax movement, bigfoot, and a whole host of other skeptical topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expected to have maybe 15 or 20 people in attendance. We had closer to 40 or 50, and many of them came up afterwards to thank us for bringing some critical thinking to Gen Con. They were surprised and excited to see that someone had put on a panel like ours. Our success led to bigger dreams, and thus, in 2010, we are bringing skepticism to Gen Con in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model, roughly, is Dragon*Con's Skeptrack — with the distinction that we're organized bottom-up whereas Derek Colanduno organized Skeptrack more-or-less top-down, with official support from the administration. This means that we don't have any “big name” skeptics yet, but with enough work, support, and luck, we hope to attract some in years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s plans include a revamped and much-improved version of last year’s panel and half-a-dozen other presentations on every topic from pseudoarchaeology to scams to cross-cultural patterns of paranormal belief — as well as a presentation from a bona-fide &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/a&gt;, Jen Myers! Most importantly, though, is the fundraiser I mentioned. I was inspired by Dr. Joe Albeitz's fundraiser at TAM7 last summer and, with some advice from him, dug into organizing one for Indiana at Gen Con last fall. I coordinated with the director of the Indiana Immunization Coalition, who was quite excited to be working with us — they’re a small, struggling group themselves. Gen Con also loved the idea and agreed to give us a free booth in their Family Fun Pavilion, the perfect place to distribute educational materials about the power of childhood vaccination, while trading donations for amazing feats of amateur magic and mentalism. We'll also be delivering a presentation tentatively titled “The Power of Vaccination” that will speak for the extreme benefits of immunization, counter some antivax claims, and introduce people to the mission and goals of the Indiana Immunization Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100% of our proceeds will go to the IIC and be used to help spearhead new educational initiatives. It was originally my intention that our money go directly toward getting vaccines for kids, but research revealed that Indiana's abysmal vax rates (in the low 40s out of the 50 states) are due not to a lack of funds; the state Department of Health has money to spare for immunization. Rather, Indiana has fallen victim to the misinformation of the antivaccine movement, and as such our fundraiser will go toward countering their bad science and propaganda and getting parents educated about childhood vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gen Con approaches, &lt;strong&gt;we are in dire need of more volunteers&lt;/strong&gt;, especially to help run the fundraiser booth. We need someone there in the exhibit hall every day from open to close, and between panels, presentations, meals, and other responsibilities we have, we'll be hard-pressed to do it all ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, please visit our website, &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalgamers.com/"&gt;SkepticalGamers&lt;/a&gt;, which has in-depth summaries of most of our talks (with more coming as I have the time), details about the fundraiser, and a contact form. Perhaps the most succinct summary of the entire program is the one I wrote &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2010/02/gen-con-updates-and-call-for-volunteers.html"&gt;at my personal blog&lt;/a&gt;.

A recent email exchange with MHRA shows it is powerless to stop Artrosilium being sold in the UK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.artrosiliumonline.com/index.php"&gt;Artrosilium&lt;/a&gt; has been a regular guest on this blog. It is an 'organic silica' gel which the sellers claim can treat arthritis, eczema, psoriasis, verrucas, various skin irritations, haemorrhoids and even prostate problems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, in the true nature of dodgy products, there's no need to prove any of the above claims - if you're flogging duff medicines and flouting the UK laws then bullshitting about your product's ability won't cause much moral panic. The product was deemed a medicinal product in 2001 by MHRA but is not licensed for sale in the UK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This blog has featured 5 blog posts on artrosilium, originally on a &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;amp;t=4447&amp;amp;p=75694&amp;amp;hilit=artrosilium#p75694"&gt;tip-off&lt;/a&gt; from Ben Goldacre on the Bad Science forums; &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/04/sciencemangle-uk-is-unregulated-case.html"&gt;The UK is Unregulated&lt;/a&gt; in 2008 introduced Artrosilium and how the MHRA were able to get the company to amend its baseless claims. However, even though the website was a .co.uk domain, this didn't count as a UK presence, and so they were powerless to go any further. The second post in July 2008 looked at &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/06/business-model-of-quackery.html"&gt;The Business Model of Quackery&lt;/a&gt;, showing how to get round the pesky UK legislation that stops rogue traders selling unlicensed medicines to unsuspecting (and often vulnerable) people. The &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/09/birthday-result-artrosilium-website.html"&gt;third mention&lt;/a&gt; was on the 1 year anniversary of this site in Sept 2008 and detailed the involvement of Members of Parliament to get www.artrosilium.co.uk closed down. It now redirects to www.artrosilium.com, which is safe from the meddling hands of the UK authorities, and has stayed that way since Aug 08, as &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.artrosilium.co.uk"&gt;The Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt; will testify. The last 2 posts (&lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/11/asa-three-strikes-and-you-arefree-to.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/02/artrosilium-intramed-windsor-bogus.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) centred on Intramed's disregard for the Advertising Standards Authority, by continually putting unsubstantiated drivel and bullshit in their adverts for their quack products. (Indeed, they are still at it - there have been &lt;a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/Complaints-and-ASA-action/Adjudications.aspx?SearchTerms=intramed#results"&gt;10 ASA rulings against Intramed&lt;/a&gt; in the last 3 years, the most recent one in &lt;a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/Complaints-and-ASA-action/Adjudications/2010/3/IntraMed-Ltd/TF_ADJ_48190.aspx"&gt;March 2010&lt;/a&gt; - This to me indicates a company which doesn't give a rat's ass about advertising, safety or legislation. But you can buy their 'medicines' of you want to - I can't believe anyone would be crazy enough to.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result of this infatuated blogging, this site now comes up 2nd on a &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=artrosilium&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;Google search for 'artrosilium'&lt;/a&gt;, and 40% of the keyword traffic to this site is associated with either artrosilium or IntraMed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, even though the above blogposts are quite old, new comments are still made, often from people who have among other things tried it, been conned by it and been wary of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the tail end of last year (2009), a chap called GrimsbyLad scanned in and emailed an Artrosilium mailshot to this blog, offering a free sample of the product, as well as 11 pages of the usual nonsense of claims like 'guaranteed arthritis relief'. It seemed like a good time to have another crack at the MHRA and trading standards and so dialogue was opened and the email conversation has been sent to this blog for coverage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first reply came in late November 2009, which stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The product Artrosilium was classified as a medicinal product by the MHRA, in December 2001. It is manufactured in France and has been sold by both Bodywell SA and IntraMed Ltd operating from outside the EU. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;In both cases the business set-up has rendered enforcement action under medicines legislation through the courts, impossible&lt;/span&gt;. There are several other products involved as well, as you will have seen from the ASA adjudications, and other Agencies have experienced similar difficulties in bringing complaints to justice.&lt;br&gt;For this reason, the MHRA, alongside certain Trading Standards Services, has referred the matter on to the Office of Fair Trading. Your e-mail and the attachments have been forwarded to them also.&lt;/blockquote&gt; My bold. That's a pretty big admission from the organisation in charge of licensing medicines in the UK to say that due to the way company has set itself up, it is no longer able to come under the MHRA's jurisdiction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MHRA were then prodded for an update in March 2010, 4 months later. Surely, having noticed that it is possible, by setting up your business in a certain way, you can circumvent UK legislation, the MHRA had made strides to close the loophole? &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately, OFT have declined to investigate the activities of Intramed. The MHRA and the Trading Standards Service are making a combined effort to exercise some control over the company's agents in the UK but, you will recognise, Intramed are well aware of the advantage their Hong Kong status confers in terms of the regulations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;No explanation was given as to why the OFT have declined to investigate - one hopes that it is because the public are savvy enough to see the product for what it is and that even a cursory investigation into IntraMed sets alarm bells ringing, and so the number of people suckered by this company are few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point however remains - if you set your business up correctly, you can sell unregulated medicines into the UK with impunity. And that's according to the people responsible for licensing the medicines in the UK, the MHRA. That, to me, is a breathtakingly dangerous situation to be in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a feeling this won't be the last blogpost on this site about Artrosilium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-5368059457397448223?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269379389170"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/03/my_new_toy_the_gomboc.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ebd2d5d642149867</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">My new toy: the Gömböc</title><published>2010-03-23T19:56:14Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T19:56:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/03/my_new_toy_the_gomboc.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not really one for collecting things. The fact that I move around a lot twinned with the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8201900.stm"&gt;pathetic size of British homes&lt;/a&gt;, doesn't square well with building up much of anything. I finally dumped all my CDs last summer; I give away my books when I'm done with them. Plus, I always felt that collecting things was for people with more money than they knew what to do with. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, my current bedroom is as anonymous as a hotel room, and so I thought I should do what every self-repecting gentleman scholar did in times gone by: build myself a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities"&gt;cabinet of curiosities&lt;/a&gt;.

(c) TED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Sam Harris has recently presented before the TED conference on  the question of whether science can answer moral questions. While I  agree with his conclusions on moral questions, I don’t think we agree on  what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[&lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html"&gt;See the video of Harris' presentation before TED&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris makes the case that moral questions can indeed be answered  through a rational approach. He asks, “Can adding cholera to the water  supply be a good idea?” and answers, “probably not.” This, of course,  assumes that we all share the same standards for what constitutes ‘good  ideas’. Harris makes it obvious several times that he is referring to  “human flourishing”, a “good life”, “thriving”, or “well-being”.  Although he does not overtly address this point, this is obviously the  standard by which he judges whether something is moral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have made precisely this argument since writing &lt;a href="http://dtstrainphilosophy.blogspot.com/2008/02/natural-objective-ethics.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natural-Objective Ethics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April of 2005.  The point being, when we look at humanity it should be obvious that the  reason for Homo sapiens’ instinctive universal tendency to form moral  norms is because this enhances its chances of survival and prosperity.  If we know the function of ethics, then we can measure a moral norm by  how well it performs that function, and we can investigate those  questions scientifically[1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris admits that defining what is precisely meant by “well being” is  difficult, but the problem is even worse than that. It is also important  to note that not everyone will share our approach to ethics, and not  everyone will share our assumed basis for the measure of an ethic (that  being, whether it leads to human flourishing). If a person or a people  believe that the basis of morality is to serve God or some other  purpose, &lt;em&gt;regardless&lt;/em&gt; of its effect on human flourishing, then  Harris’ argument fails to connect, and is even somewhat  question-begging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the arguments of my N-O Ethics and Harris’ presentation may be  good ways to illustrate to rationally-minded people how there can be an  objectively “right answer” and “wrong answer” to moral questions, an  entirely different angle on different topics is needed to reach the  fundamentalist. This failure to connect with fundamentalists on the  basis of morality is an important point that will become even more  important later in this article.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rational morality: what to do about it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris and I agree that there are right and wrong answers to moral  questions and that these can be investigated rationally and even  scientifically. However, that’s where our agreement seems to end. To  really see Harris’ approach, one may need to have read some of his other  works and seen some of his other presentations, because much of his  overall thesis in the TED presentation is subtle or even unstated at  times. I’m not implying subterfuge, but rather he had a particular focus  in this presentation and those not familiar with his writings may not  have caught the full drift of his outlook by this one video, even though  it clearly connected to his overall views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important question of our time is not whether moral questions can be  investigated and answered through rational means. That is already  happening in nearly every field; and will only continue to happen over  time, whether people realize it or not. No, the important question of  our time is – what are we rationalists going to do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a subtle bemoaning of his intellectual colleagues who insist all  morality is subjective, Harris admits in the presentation that, to his  chagrin, the majority of people w&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ith whom he seems to agree on the  objectivity of ethics are the religious fundamentalists! Harris does not  take this as a cautionary indicator that might be saying something  important to him about his views, but rather, looks at it as a case of  irony that his otherwise enlightened colleagues haven’t achieved this  insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris does point out that the reasons behind the fundamentalists’  belief in objective ethics are very different from his own; that being  their belief that a perfect deity has delivered this knowledge to them.  But I would point out another difference (hopefully) between the  rational approach to Natural-Objective ethics and the religious  fundamentalist approach. As I stated in &lt;em&gt;Natural-Objective Ethics&lt;/em&gt;,  there is an important difference between saying “there is a right  answer” and saying “&lt;em&gt;I have&lt;/em&gt; the right answer”. The latter is the  extra step the fundamentalists take with certainty. I am not appealing  to subjectivism here. The endeavor of moral progress is not one of  invention, but of discovery – but like scientific discovery, we must  hold conclusions provisionally, and must be open to further  investigation and correction over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is of more concern is what we do with our rationally-based  provisional moral answers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris says that we must “converge” on matters of great moral  importance. I agree that flourishing is the goal, and that convergence  on that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would be wonderful. But how to go about it is another matter.  Harris speaks fluently about the dangers of religious extremism, but I  see in his approach much reactionary fear – an overall perspective that  focuses, perhaps myopically, on controlling the world and bending it  into what we think it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic22.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="dtstrain-article-pic2" src="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic22.jpg?w=700" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...we must guard against the... unwarranted  influence... by the military-industrial complex.&amp;quot; --President Dwight D.  Eisenhower, 1961&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States was once a far less invasive nation, not only  militarily but economically, culturally, and so on. Thomas Jefferson  suggested that we be friends with many nations, but have entangling  alliances with none. Since World War II however, the modus operandi of  the nation changed to something more like the Imperialist mindset of our  Western roots. We had already become more militarily involved overseas  and we had shifted to a war-based economy. Powerful corporations had  much to gain by continued production of war machines. President  Eisenhower warned the American people of this in his farewell speech  regarding the dangers of the &lt;em&gt;military-industrial complex&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through our long Cold War with the Soviet Union, the world was our chess  board and smaller nations our pawns. Entangling alliances abound as  each superpower did whatever it could to manipulate the global stage to  its advantage. This often underhanded process set up many of the  unfortunate social, political, economic, and cultural situations in  other nations that today create the conditions ripe for the terrorism we  now face. Throughout the process, more and more of our military bases  appeared on the soil of other nations, in addition to an influx of our  corporations and culture, whether greatly welcome or not. In fact, the  entire history of our nation since the mid 20th Century can be looked at  as one long state of war – it’s goal to cast an ever increasing net of  strategic forces over the planet. This process has given us much more to  lose, and created a situation in which we are frequently attacked. When  that happens, we feel less secure and more fearful as a people, and our  response is to seek even greater control over the globe in the belief  that we can gain enough control to one day be safe. We always seem to  have good intentions such as security, fighting for freedom, or  liberating others – but the result is the same: the more control we try  to exert over the world, the less secure and more afraid we become.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Harris’ solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must be careful that Harris’ correct conclusions about the objective  nature of moral questions does not lead us down the path of seeking to  dominate others with our vision of ‘how things should be’. Would the  Crusades be any more palatable if the brand of morality the crusaders  were attempting to erect by force had been derived through scientific  investigation on the basis of human flourishing? There is some  indication Harris seems content that a few egg shells may need to be  broken in order to erect this ‘convergence’ on human ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris says in his presentation that we can no longer “respect or  tolerate” vast differences of opinion on moral questions in such a  dangerous intertwined world. It is true that, in one’s personal life  considerations, every view on morality doesn’t ‘have to count’ as he  says. In fact, it’s actually important that it not – that a person have a  healthy deliberative standard by which to evaluate moral opinions and  assertions. But Harris takes this personal standard of healthy  skepticism and seeks to apply it on a sociological level, with  concerning implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One who has read and heard Harris’ other works will note that his  objection is not just with violent religious extremists, but with the  ‘moderates’ who hold similar religious views but do no violence. I point  that out, not to disagree but because of its implications on how we  must interact with other nations in terms of sheer number. It should be  added that he has in the past suggested torture and the preemptive use  of nuclear weapons may be appropriate in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; limited cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris uses the example of the facts upon which safety standards of  buildings and airplanes are based as being analogous to moral questions,  and I concur. However, the important question is whether we go about  global domination, tolerating whatever manner of violence may be  necessary, to ensure that building safety standards converge in all  corners of humanity, and are administered by a single board that will do  the appropriate studies to determine what those regulations should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall my earlier point about the failure of Harris’ argument to connect  with religionists on the underlying basis of morality. This is where  that point becomes especially important. When all of these people do not  share Harris’ underlying definitions and conceptions on the purpose and  function of ethics, they will be immune to his arguments for a  scientific take on moral matters, and when this is mixed with ourselves  discarding even &lt;em&gt;tolerance&lt;/em&gt; of ‘vast differences of opinion’ on  moral matters, then such an onslaught may be the only alternative Harris  leaves us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic31.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="dtstrain-article-pic3" src="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic31.jpg?w=700" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muslim woman in burqa.

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the presentation, the questioner asks Harris what we do  when a women who wears a veil says that she wishes to do so of her own  accord. Harris responds that we will eventually be able to measure  scientifically whether these sorts of cultural norms lead to fathers who  love their daughters more. The questioner then asks, “And if the  results come out that, actually they do, are you prepared to shift your  instinctive current judgment on some of these issues?” To that, Harris  noted that it’s not just the father’s experience of love we have to look  at, but “well-being in a larger context” – that it is “all of us  together”. It is true that we must defend ourselves against direct violence, but it  is also precisely because it is “all of us together” in the larger  scope of things that respect and tolerance must have a place, even where  it isn’t comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris’ mistake is in his focus on achieving greater control over the  actions of others. It is the traditional Western Imperialist perspective  on ‘engineering the world’ as it ‘should be’ that has not changed.  What’s even more concerning is the underlying incentive upon which his  argument is based, which is &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;. Although he mentions only  briefly this world “filled with destructive technology”, fear of this  destruction is the underlying motivation of his argument for discarding  tolerance and respect.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we should be looking inward. Why are we so scared that we might  be willing to perform nearly any act to ensure that others converge as  we believe they should? Further, there are many ways to help educate and  change the world, but that door is only opened through respectful  relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic41.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="dtstrain-article-pic4" src="http://spacecityskeptics.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dtstrain-article-pic41.jpg?w=700" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a trap! (cc) somegeekintn, Flickr.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, what Harris says is true: there is a ‘right answer’ to moral  questions, which can be discovered, albeit imperfectly, through rational  means. But to spread truth requires a unique approach. The solution to  these inter-cultural problems of cyclical violence is like a Chinese  finger trap puzzle, which gets more difficult the more you resist it.  Its solution requires no physical strength at all. The outcome of such  an approach is by no means certain, but the effects of this approach can  be profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the Chinese, &lt;a href="http://www.vl-site.org/taoism/cz-text2.html#HUMAN"&gt;Yen  Huei&lt;/a&gt; once came to the Taoist philosopher Chuang-Tzu and complained  about the Prince of Wei. He said he was an old man of “unmanageable  disposition”. Yen Huei continues, “He behaves as if the people were of  no account, and will not see his own faults. He disregards human lives  and the people perish… The people do not know where to turn for help.”  Yen Huei suggests he may go and confront the Prince.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuag-Tzu tells Yen Huei that preachiness and brute force will only make  wicked men hate him. Fighting fire with fire is called aggravation,  warns Chuang-Tzu. On the other hand, if you begin with concessions,  there will be no end to them. Yen Huei proposes all manner of  approaching the Prince and Chuang-Tzu points out why the Prince will be  unresponsive. What then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chuang-Tzu says that to know what we should do, we must first become  blank – we must engage in a ‘fasting of the heart’. By this, he means we  must hold back on our judgments and reactionary nature so that our ego  (self) is no longer in the way of our clear seeing and understanding. At that  point, it becomes easier to see that we must get to know our enemies,  build relations, talk when they are in a mood to listen and refrain when  not. Do so without labels and let things take their natural course,  then you may have a chance of success. This is called walking without  touching the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Chuang-Tzu refers to is a way of handling people and events that is  more sophisticated. Like the Chinese finger trap puzzle, it is  observing carefully and using the momentum and nature of the thing  against which we struggle to bring about the change we desire. But to  take this approach, we need to put away our egotistical judgments and  obsessions which keep us from truly understanding others, and we need to  temper our fears. If we can suspend these long enough to understand,  then we can begin acting in ways that really are productive for the  whole. Not only does it require humility, but it requires bravery,  because it is so much easier to succumb to our fears and pick up a sword  and shield (or machine gun and bomb, as the case may be). This approach  can work, and &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; worked, on a national level at various times  and places – if we are committed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a freethinker, a skeptic, and a naturalist, I am a believer in the  power of reason – but not merely the power of my reason. Reason can and  does flourish in free minds naturally. It flourishes best in minds that  are not threatened or offended. Fear is a powerful temptation, and it  often may be very difficult not to let it cloud our vision or make us  react with blunt force. Fear is also insidious and will subtly find its  way into our underlying motivations and rationalizations – all while we  believe we are being very intellectual, unemotional, and rational – as  Harris &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to be in his presentations and writings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already tried the option of having the ‘right answer’ for the  world, with unfortunate results. Compassion, tolerance, and respect can  have profound effects on enemies, but we as a nation have yet to even  try that approach in any serious or deep manner. It requires far more  bravery than we have, sadly, yet been able to muster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————&lt;br&gt;
[1]&lt;em&gt; For stoicism enthusiasts, since I often write on that philosophy:  In Stoicism, the only ‘good’ is my virtuous choice. But what is virtue?  Virtue consists of the correct selection among Indifferents – that being  the Preferred Indifferents. And, what determines whether something is a  Preferred Indifferent? Whether it is in accord with Nature. The nature  of human beings is to thrive and survive, thus when it comes to complex  issues we can use our ‘spark of the divine fire’ – rational means  (including the scientific method) to try to understand what is more  likely to lead to survival and prosperity (i.e what is more likely to be  in accord with Nature).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to Aurthur Fay for making me aware of Harris’ presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When it came to babies born to crack-addicted mothers, the media went overboard, creating a crisis in the form of an epidemic that never quite was. By contrast, when it came to babies born to alcoholic mothers, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome went unrecognized in the science and medical community until 1968.

Now comes a study on prenatal methamphetamine exposure in The Journal of Neuroscience, headed up by Elizabeth Sowell of the University of California, Los Angeles, with support from both the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA.) The report garnered considerable media attention. “We know that alcohol exposure is toxic to the developing fetus and can result in lifelong brain, cognitive and behavioral problems,” Sowell said in a press release. “In this study, we show that the effects of prenatal meth exposure, or the combination of meth and alcohol exposure, may actually be worse.”

It makes sense that meth might effect the health of unborn children.  There is a modest body of research to support the notion. The Sowell study points a finger at the caudate nucleus, a brain region involved with learning and memory.  The study showed that the caudate nucleus of the meth-using group was reduced in size. “Identifying vulnerable brain structures may help predict particular learning and behavioral problems in meth-exposed children,” the press release optimistically states. And the potential problem is real enough: More than 16 million Americans have used meth, according to government numbers. An estimated 19,000 of these users are pregnant women. 

But is this particular study a definitive one? The icing on the cake? To begin with, the press release from The Journal of Neuroscience admits to a major problem right up front: “About half of women who say they used meth during pregnancy also used alcohol, so isolating the effects of meth on the developing brain is difficult.”  Even in cases of meth exposure only, there are a host of negative behavioral factors that often accompany meth addiction (bad nutrition, minimal health care, poor health) that can significantly effect fetal development. 

The study team compared the MRI brain scans of 61 children: “21 with prenatal MA (methamphetamine) exposure, 18 with concomitant prenatal alcohol exposure (the MAA group), 13 with heavy prenatal alcohol but not MA exposure (ALC group), and 27 unexposed controls. While finding “striatal volume reductions,” as well as increases in the size of certain limbic structures in both groups with meth and/or alcohol exposure, the researchers conclude that striatal and limbic structures “may be more vulnerable to prenatal MA exposure than alcohol exposure.” However, that conclusion was apparently reached despite the fact that only 3 of the 61 children under study were born to mothers who did meth, and meth only, during pregnancy. 

Furthermore, there is significant controversy over brain scan studies that measure gross anatomical changes in the size of specific brain regions, rather than brain region activity based on blood flow. 

Is there other evidence for the danger of meth use during pregnancy? There is, but as is frequently the case, some of the best evidence comes from animal studies. A 2008 guinea pig study by Sanika Chirwa 

showed neural damage to the hippocampus, another region involved in memory, in newborn animals with prenatal meth exposure. Furthermore, the newborn animals showed an impaired ability to distinguish novel objects from familiar ones.

In 2006, a study at Brown Medical School, published in Pediatrics , found that newborns exposed to meth during pregnancy were born “small for gestational age,” meaning they were born full-term, but smaller than babies not exposed to meth in utero.  According to study author Barry Lester, “Children who are born underweight tend to have behavior problems, such as hyperactivity or short attention span, as well as learning difficulties.”

However, Lester added an important caveat in a Brown University press release : “I hope that the ‘crack baby’ hysteria does not get repeated. While these children may have some serious health and developmental challenges, there is no automatic need to label them as damaged and remove them from their biological mothers.” 

Similar caution was urged by the authors of a 2009 report in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics: “Efforts to understand specific effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure on cognitive processing are hampered by high rates of concomitant alcohol use during pregnancy.”

In 2005, an open letter from the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland warned about the dangers of hyperbole, calling upon the media and public officials to “stop perpetuating ‘meth baby’ myths.” The Center argued that “The terms ‘ice babies’ and ‘meth babies’ lack medical and scientific validity and should not be used,” and requested that “policies addressing prenatal exposure to methamphetamines and media coverage of this issue be based on science, not presumption or prejudice.”

Over and over, &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/accommodationist-and-proud-of-it-part-i/"&gt;he repeats one simple, common phrase that I applied to him&lt;/a&gt; — it must have been painfully memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been called many things in my time, but I truly believe that "clueless gobshite" is a first. In a way, I am almost proud of this. After all, if you are in your seventieth year and someone feels so strongly about your ideas that they refer to you in this way, then you must be doing something right. Or if not exactly right, you must have ideas that others want to challenge so strongly that they pull out this kind of language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very peculiar phenomenon. Here is the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/in_which_andrew_brown_gets_eve.php"&gt;post in which I casually referred to Ruse as a "clueless gobshite"&lt;/a&gt;; I criticized him and Andrew Brown much more strongly than that one remark would imply, yet it is all that stuck in his head. He repeatedly agonizes over the cruelty of my remark, and acts as if all I had to say about him was one vicious, cutting cliche, and he encapsulates every criticism in that one insult. Further, he hangs himself on a cross and tries to claim he didn't deserve even that, that his crime was of being &lt;i&gt;too reasonable&lt;/i&gt;, of being &lt;i&gt;generous and charitable&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, I am excoriated at every turn. Why? Simply, because I am an "Accommodationist." I think that some kind of intellectual meeting is possible with religious believers, including Christian religious believers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, poor Michael Ruse, that gentle-souled and open-minded fellow who merely wants to reach out to his fellow human beings with sympathy—how could he deserve such unkind criticism? I clutch my pearls with one hand, place the other on my brow, and gaze skyward with eyes welling tearfully, and then swoon upon the fainting couch installed handily near my desk. Michael, Michael, Michael…how could we abuse you so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, with good reason, and my attacks on his flawed character have been even stronger than you'd guess from his limited quoting. What prompted my rudeness wasn't his pious apologetics for the common man, but that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/a_little_sympathy_for_the_snoo.php"&gt;Ruse visited the Creation "Museum"&lt;/a&gt;, ignored the lunacy on display (except to express his sympathy with it), and went on to identify the real culprit in this anti-intellectual abomination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Ruse went to Ken Ham's house, twirled about among the exhibits showing dinosaurs with saddles, Noah's ark being built to carry off members of every species on earth, exhortations to accept Biblical literalism, and accusations of malice and dishonesty against every sensible biologists, and what do he and Andrew Brown do? Why, &lt;i&gt;blame the atheists&lt;/i&gt;, of course.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That is insane.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What the hell is wrong with Ruse? How can he stand among the lies, with little children being told abominable fabrications, and think then that the pressing problem is people who demand evidence for their beliefs? I was unimpressed with his momentary show of self-serving "open-mindedness"; but I was disgusted with his completely inappropriate neglect of a genuine problem to fling blame at the people who have consistently opposed every facet of that monument to ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Ruse really needs to carefully read my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/a_little_sympathy_for_the_snoo.php"&gt;original complaint&lt;/a&gt;, because I'm not giving him a rhetorical slap because he's too open-minded. I'm kicking him to the curb because ideas matter (something I would think a philosopher would care about), and he espouses a kind of waffling relativism that acts as if young earth creationism and science are equivalently deserving of respect, and that if atheists would just shut up we'd all be living in a happy, loving relationship with Ken Ham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's not just a clueless gobshite. He's a traitor to reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/i_am_so_good_at_making_michael.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/MuO4GbY0ZUM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269375768936"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=4905">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf873604f8ced2d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">He’s a unique, stuffed bear</title><published>2010-03-23T19:03:23Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T19:03:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/TQCHEZ3NUnQ/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Left Brain/Right Brain</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269375768935"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=4893">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b6ce1f43b8ad1f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Disney Channel short on autism sibling experience: The Time I Realized My Brother was Different</title><published>2010-03-23T18:04:35Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T18:04:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/m7jwKTpJZvI/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269375143754"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22680">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6615f9eb35453b62</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">The Ted Bundy of String Theory</title><published>2010-03-23T20:00:31Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T20:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/23/the-ted-bundy-of-string-theory/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/strong&gt;‘ talk at TED was just released and you can see some of the material he’ll be writing about in his new book — &lt;em&gt;The Moral Landscape: How science can determine human values&lt;/em&gt;, which will be released October 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t really into it for the first half, but it got good (for me) around the 9:48 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some really fascinating things he discusses, such as the question of whether a Muslim man who wants the women in his life to wear veils loves his daughters as much as his sons — and how brain scans could soon tell us the answer to that.  And how even that scan could have a loophole…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, if we could show that science can lead to positive ethics, it would take away one of the biggest reasons people think they need religion.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing about the brain can sometimes bring me amazingly close to my readers–so close that I feel like I’m inside their minds. Case in point: &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2010/mar/23-the-brain-look-deep-into-mind.s-eye/"&gt;my new column for Discover&lt;/a&gt;, on the subject of the mind’s eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.4em;padding-top:7px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;font-size:14px;color:#000000;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One day in 2005, a retired building surveyor in Edinburgh visited his doctor with a strange complaint: His mind’s eye had suddenly gone blind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.4em;padding-top:7px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;font-size:14px;color:#000000;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The surveyor, referred to as MX by his doctors, was 65 at the time. He had always felt that he possessed an exceptional talent for picturing things in his mind. The skill had come in handy in his job, allowing MX to recall the fine details of the buildings he surveyed. Just before drifting off to sleep, he enjoyed running through recent events as if he were watching a movie. He could picture his family, his friends, and even characters in the books he read.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.4em;padding-top:7px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;font-size:14px;color:#000000;padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then these images all vanished. The change happened shortly after MX went to a hospital to have his blocked coronary arteries treated. As a cardiologist snaked a tube into the arteries and cleared out the obstructions, MX felt a “reverberation” in his head and a tingling in his left arm. He didn’t think to mention it to his doctors at the time. But four days later he realized that when he closed his eyes, all was darkness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.4em;padding-top:7px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:14px;color:#000000"&gt;I describe the singular case of MX, and what he tells scientists about our mind’s eye. &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.08.024"&gt;The original paper&lt;/a&gt; that inspired the column compared MX to a group of normal men of his age and profession to figure out what was unique about him. But to my surprise–and to the surprise of the scientists I wrote about–a lot of readers felt a great kinship with MX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:5px;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.4em;padding-top:7px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;font-size:14px;color:#000000"&gt;Discover is running a selection of letters to the editor about the column, and a response from the scientists. It won’t be available online, but I was so fascinated by the exchange that I’m reprinting it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In March’s “The Brain” [page 28], Carl Zimmer assumes that having a mind’s eye is a normal function of the human senses. Yet I have never had a mind’s eye, and when I bring this up in conversation others often voice the same complaint. How common is this?&lt;br&gt;
Marshall Krause 	San Geronimo, CA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroscientists Adam Zeman and Sergio Della Sala reply:&lt;br&gt;
We have encountered people who report that they have never experienced imagery; they seem little if at all disabled by their deficiency. We hope to study this neglected phenomenon using psychological and brain imaging techniques like those with which we explored the case of MX. Such research may help explain both the basis of imagery production in the brain and how (if at all) imagery is useful to us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I enjoyed reading about MX and his mind’s-eye blindness. Were MX’s dream experiences also affected by this affliction?&lt;br&gt;
Arlene Barker  Homer City, PA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zeman and Della Sala reply:&lt;br&gt;
For about a year after the loss of his mind’s eye, MX reported that he dreamed without visual imagery. But then his visual dreaming recovered at night, even though his mind’s eye remained blank by day. This suggests that the brain mechanisms involved in dreaming can be teased apart from those involved in deliberate imagery formation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aldrin told reporters that he agreed to participate on the show as a way to bring attention to space travel and to encourage science education.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src="http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/5407/planetsf.jpg" alt="planets" width="224" height="224"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the only actual quotes I could find from Buzz from the show were, “I hope when people think about voting they think about not just the most talented, energetic people with the sexiest uniforms and outfits, but who they want to see develop the next week’s dance.” And when asked about his dance partner he said, “This is a really cute babe…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes! Never have more inspirational science quotes been uttered. Come along children, we must go study the moons of Saturn now! I too want to be an astronaut!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Buzz received the lowest score on the show’s premiere and one of the judges said of his dance skills, “It looked like you still had your moon boots on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More after the click!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course in Mr. Aldrin’s defense he is 80 years old, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUI36tPKDg4"&gt;still kicks total ass&lt;/a&gt; and has done &lt;strong&gt;plenty&lt;/strong&gt; in his lifetime to encourage interest in space travel and in science education. If at this point in his life he wants to do the cha-cha-cha on TV with a cute babe, well then I say good for him. It is also not his fault that &lt;em&gt;Dancing With The Stars&lt;/em&gt; is far more interested in sexy dance moves than any intellectual endeavors. They could give a rat’s ass about science. They will edit and stage the show in order to express &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; views. They have no intention of inspiring anything other than tight sparkly-dresses and getting &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to tune in next week to see what happens! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story brings to mind a topic that is often tossed around behind the scenes here at Skepchick and among other skeptical groups that I participate in. The question is should we put ourselves out there in a more aggressive fashion? Should we search out the limelight? Should we go after media opportunities simply to get our names and &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; our messages out there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately once a month a call for “skeptics” gets passed around the skeptical community. I put skeptics in quotes because while the casting companies and various pilot TV shows approach us claiming that they want a skeptic what they usually really want is someone they can edit to look like a naysayer, a contrarian or a grumpy cynic. Occasionally they also want a PHD or specialist to lend credibility to their production. Most of the time all the stereotypes that the skeptical &lt;img src="http://img29.imageshack.us/img29/5157/skepchicktv1.jpg" alt="skepchick tv" width="368" height="368"&gt;community wishes to avoid are what casting directors want. In fact many of these types of shows have in fact cultivated the stereotypes we wish to shake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time skeptics ignore these requests but I sometimes wonder if it would help the skeptical movement if we tried to jump in the ring with the ghost hunters and psychics now and then. My guess is that if they decided to ever use any of us on a paranormal show the stage choreography and editing would be designed to make us look like jerks. Our message would be diminished and whatever the point of the show is would be promoted. Any words of skeptical wisdom would end up on the cutting room floor. As many of us realize, reality TV is not reality at all. And I fear it could do more harm than good, as our collective reputations would be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think? Should we try to get the skeptical message out there even if we may be edited to look like the fool?

ARTISTS employ a number of different techniques to represent implied motion in two-dimensional works. One of these, commonly used in posters, comics and animation, is the affine shear effect, whereby a moving object is depicted as leaning into the direction of movement. Cartoonists also use action lines to depict movement and speed, with straight lines conveying fast movements and wavy lines conveying slower ones. Motion can also be conveyed by superimposing several images showing the successive positions of a movement, or by a blurred image showing the different positions simultaneously.

The Japanese artist and printmaker Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) used a different and innovative technique to convey motion. The simple line drawings in his Manga strips lack all of the commonly-used motion effects, yet give a strong impression of movement by depicting the human body in highly unstable postures. As a new study just published in the journal NeuroReport shows, the figures in the sketches are perceived to be moving because their gravity-defying postures activate regions of the visual cortex that are sensitive to motion.

This is one of those times. So enjoy this bit of Classic Insolence from back in April 2007 and be assured that I'll be back tomorrow. Remember, if you've been reading less than three years, it's new to you, and, even if you have been reading more than three years, it's fun to see how posts like this have aged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From fellow ScienceBlogger &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2007/04/how_med_school_faculty_are_tre.php"&gt;Abel&lt;/a&gt;, I'm made aware of an excellent post on the &lt;a href="http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/2007/04/medical-schools-to-faculty-show-me.html"&gt;Health Care Renewal Blog&lt;/a&gt; about the financial reality of being an academic physician in a modern U.S. medical school. It's an excellent overview of how medical schools view clinical faculty as, in essence, cash cows that have to bring in the cash and pay for themselves. The same thing actually applies to basic scientists as well, and I do have to quibble a bit with the internal medicine-centered view of the various ways that faculty are expected to bring in money, which do not necessarily apply to academic surgery departments (more about both quibbles below), but overall it's a great primer about what it is like to do research and teach in medical schools circa 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let's set the stage, with the definitions of &lt;a href="http://hcrenewal.blogspot.com/2007/04/medical-schools-to-faculty-show-me.html"&gt;four types of faculty&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/biomedical_researchers_at_medical_school_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/biomedical_researchers_at_medical_school_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/eVaAhUfbLf4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269371196976"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/this_is_why_i_like_joe_biden.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c9e6b303584cd62</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">This is why I like Joe Biden.</title><published>2010-03-23T19:52:46Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T19:52:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/6N9gjds2rK8/this_is_why_i_like_joe_biden.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/this_is_why_i_like_joe_biden.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outspoken and hard-working Indian rationalist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanal_Edamaruku"&gt;Sanal Edamaruku&lt;/a&gt; had enough. When the &amp;quot;guru&amp;quot; Pandit Surender Sharma claimed he could kill a man using nothing but magic powers, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7067989.ece"&gt;Edamaruku challenged Sharma to kill him on live TV in India&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, Sharma eventually agreed, and what played out on the air &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpwCuv_izn4"&gt;is pretty funny to watch&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NpwCuv_izn4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26hd%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gee, this would’ve looked silly without the dramatic music. If any BABloggees in India would post a transcript in the comments, I’d be grateful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part is Edamaruku constantly smiling and shaking his head, giving Sharma exactly what he deserves: derision. Still, millions of people  in India follow gurus like this purveyor of nonsense, so it’s serious business. I imagine that Sharma will lose exactly zero followers after this, given people’s ability to rationalize failure (not to be confused over &lt;em&gt;being rational&lt;/em&gt; about failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad that this guy was exposed on national TV in India, but I have to think that Mr. Edamaruku could’ve saved quite a bit of time and effort had he pointed out one simple thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this guy is so powerful, &lt;strong&gt;why does he wear glasses?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Top) A footprint made by an experimental subject using a normal, "extended" gait. Middle) A footprint made by an experimental subject using a "bent-knee, bent-hip" gait. Bottom) A Laetoli footprints. From Raichlen et al., 2010.

About 3.6 million years ago, at a spot now in Laetoli, Tanzania, a pair of hominins trudged through the ashfall dumped onto the landscape by a nearby volcano. We don't know for certain what they looked like (it is generally believed that they were Australopithecus afarensis from the presence of fossils found at the site), but the fossil trackway they left behind has provided scientists with a narrow glimpse into the life and behavior of these individuals. The big question has been what these tracks say about how the prehistoric humans moved. Did they walk like us, like apes forced to stand up, or in an entirely different fashion?

According to a new study published this week in PLoS One, the famous Laetoli trackway preserves the footprints of upright, bipedal hominins that walked in a manner extremely similar to us. After making eight modern human subjects walk through a 5 meter long sand trackway (both normally and using a bent-knee, bent-hip posture thought to simulate the gait of apes) David Raichlen, Adam Gordon, and colleagues compared the footprints to the fossil tracks from Laetoli using three-dimensional scans. What they found was that the Laetoli tracks most closely resembled those made by people walking using a normal, "extended limb" gait and not the bent-knee, bent-hip gait.

Part Three of the book concludes with Chapter Eleven, “Quantum Time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction between “incomplete knowledge” and “intrinsic quantum indeterminacy” is worth dwelling on. If the wave function tells us there is a 75 percent chance of observing the cat under the table and a 25 percent chance of observing her on the sofa, that does not mean there is a 75 percent chance that the cat is under the table and a 25 percent chance that she is on the sofa. There is no such thing as “where the cat is.” Her quantum state is described by a superposition of the two distinct possibilities we would have in classical mechanics. It’s not even that “they are both true at once”; it’s that there is no “true” place where the cat is. The wave function is the best description we have of the reality of the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear why this is hard to accept at first blush. To put it bluntly, the world doesn’t look anything like that. We see cats and planets and even electrons in particular positions when we look at them, not in superpositions of different possibilities described by wave functions. But that’s the true magic of quantum mechanics: What we see is not what there is. The wave function really exists, but we don’t see it when we look; we see things as if they were in particular ordinary classical configurations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title notwithstanding, the point of the chapter is not that there’s some “quantum” version of time that we have to understand.  Some people labor under the impression that the transition from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics ends up “quantizing” everything, and turning continuous parameters into discrete ones, perhaps even including time.  It doesn’t work that way; the conventional formalism of quantum mechanics (such as the Schrödinger equation) implies that time should be a continuous parameter.  Things could conceivably change when we eventually understand quantum gravity, but they just as conceivably might not.  In fact, I’d argue that the smart money is on time remaining continuous once all is said and done.  (As a small piece of evidence, the context in which we understand quantum gravity the best is probably the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence"&gt;AdS/CFT&lt;/a&gt; correspondence, where the Schrödinger equation is completely conventional and time is perfectly continuous.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we still need to talk about quantum mechanics for the purposes of this book, for one very good reason:  we’ve been making a big deal about how the fundamental laws of physics are reversible, but wave function collapse (under the textbook Copenhagen interpretation) is an apparent counterexample.  Whether it’s a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; counterexample, or simply an artifact of an inadequate interpretation of quantum mechanics, is a matter of much debate.  I personally come down on the side that believes that there’s no fundamental irreversibility, only apparent irreversibility, in quantum mechanics.  That’s basically the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation"&gt;many-worlds interpretation&lt;/a&gt;, so I felt the book needed a chapter on what that was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I get to give my own perspective on what quantum mechanics really means.  Unlike certain parts of the book, I’m pretty happy with how this one came out — feel free to correct me if you don’t completely agree.  Quantum mechanics can certainly be tricky to understand, for the basic reason that what we see isn’t the same as what there is.  I’m firmly convinced that most expositions of the subject make it seem even more difficult than it should be, by speaking as if “what we see” really does reflect “what there is,” even if we should know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/03/kitty.jpg" alt="Two-slit kitty" title="Two-slit kitty" width="400" height="360"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I present a number of colorful examples of two-state systems involving cats and dogs.  Experts will recognize very standard treatments of the two-slit experiment and the EPR experiment, but in very different words.  Things that seem very forbidding when phrased in terms of interference fringes and electron spins hopefully become a bit more accessible when we’re asking whether the cat is on the sofa or under the table.  I did have to treat complicated macroscopic objects with many moving parts as if they could be described as very simple systems, but I judged that to be a worthwhile compromise in the interests of pedagogy.  And no animals were harmed in the writing of this chapter!  Let me know how you think the strategy worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;No longer than a short while after the program got up and running did the tribe watch its last first language Osage speaker pass away, Lucille Roubedeaux.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As Uncle Mogre explained, “This is the last train out. If we can’t get it done this time around, then that’s it. There is no more after this. That’s it.” Everyone who ever heard those words fully understood the gravity of the situation, and decided that they did not want the language dying on their watch, including myself. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;With the introduction of the language department, dedicated students and teachers started to create new speakers for the first time in only God knows how many years. It’s quite literally been close to 200 years since the last time the number of Osage speakers INCREASED. It’s difficult to take into account what this scrappy bunch of Osages has done until you put it into perspective. The Vatican even called to verify the miracle (Ok I made that last part up).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, opinions (and actions) about the importantance of language revitalization efforts vary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Not long after bearing witness to this feat, I found myself at an Indigenous language conference in Stroud, Oklahoma. Story after story, I heard language department directors talk about battling their respective tribal governments over their efforts to preserve their respective community’s languages. You should have seen the looks on their faces as I explained in Osage country we had created a situation where it was political suicide to go AGAINST the language. I proudly boasted the triumphs of Uncle Mogre and his crew to a bunch of drop jawed faces. Of course some of the elders in the room didn’t believe me simply because they know Osages are always bragging and making stuff up that isn’t true to make themselves sound real keen. I’ll admit I might have embellished a little…..but not much. Honest. We just want to put our best foot forward. Be the best we can. It’s a pretty simple yet good philosophy to live by.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;My tales of Uncle Mogre’s language exploits went far and wide, causing other programs to come check it out for themselves. They came to see how a program with no first language speakers, being led by a man with no formal training in education or linguistics, sufficiently funded by his tribal government had attained such a feat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Fast forward to January, 2010. The Osage Nation Government passes a budget bill that cuts $120,000.00 with six line items receiving $1 in their budgets. Ouch… Meat Pie sale anyone?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Last weekend right off the heels of the budget cuts, about fifteen Osages met, on their own dollar, at the White Hair Museum between Fairfax and Hominy. They met for the language program’s monthly language immersion event.; usually meeting once a month on a Sunday at various places like museums or the zoo etc. I have been to a few of these events and always enjoy myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We were greeted by Stephanie Rapp in the entrance where we looked at ribbonwork, old pictures, videos and books. I was accompanied by my freshly anointed pregnant wife Electa. We sat around talking as much Osage as we could for the better part of the afternoon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I am hoping this program remains well supported by its government. I want those waterboys at the end of the bench to have what I have enjoyed from this program over these last years. And most importantly I want the program to make possible my dream of creating the first, first language speaker our family has had since my grandpa spoke as a young boy. An audacious braggadocios improbable feat I know. But then again I’m Osage I can’t help but do it up right. WA.SHKA^ as they say, do the best you can. I’m about to be a dad. I got to start thinking about these types of things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;You see…regardless of whether or not those in the Osage Nation Congress who pushed for these cuts and then voted this budget to the Chief’s desk to be signed realize it or not, Osages are going to convene. On their own dollars if necessary, and simply do one thing. Talk. About what isn’t the point. The point is, they will talk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"It's surprising; It's a sense of discovery," one that artists, who speak through a visual language, respond to. "You know that there's beauty in the idea of evolution," she said, adding that art can express that beauty.

&lt;p&gt;The Minneapolis-based artist, a member of the bio-art movement that seeks to bridge the worlds of art and science, uses recent discoveries about the human genome as the basis for portraits and other works that offer a glimpse into our roots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You get to kill Zeus! There has been a whole series of these games, apparently, and &lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/3/22/"&gt;Penny Arcade hints at a new direction they could take&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to wonder what the public response to such a game would be. Killing Zeus is reasonable and uncontroversial (except for generic concerns about violence), but I suspect a swordfight with Jesus would freak a few people out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never played this game, but I admit…give me a shot at the Abrahamic gods, and I&amp;#39;d probably buy it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/kratos_has_a_new_mission.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tvxykzZ0bdo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269359101739"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/?p=7460">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9d0ae23ae133ce4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellaneous"/><category term="E. coli"/><category term="food safety"/><category term="hamburger"/><category term="MIT"/><title type="html">On The Color of Hamburger</title><published>2010-03-23T15:44:47Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T15:44:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/03/23/on-the-color-of-hamburger/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">Here at MIT, we're doing a science journalism boot camp this week on food. And I've already picked up my first troublesome factoid: Hamburgers that look well done, observes J. Glenn Morris, Director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida, aren't necessarily safe.

In his lecture this morning, Morris observed that while cooking meat at a temperature of 160 degrees kills pathogens like the dangerous E. coli 0157:H7, 25 percent of hamburger patties will appear cooked at lower temperatures than that. Therefore, not only are rare or medium rare patties not necessarily safe to eat, but even a brown color shouldn't inspire full confidence.

In truth, you need a food thermometer to be sure you've got a well cooked hamburger. And nobody whips those out before digging in at a fast food or pubby food restaurant.

I know I don't, and I eat a lot of hamburgers. Or at least, I used to.

The difficulty stems partly from the fact that consciousness is likely not localized in any one specific brain region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as our technology advances and we are able to look at brain function in real time and in greater detail, researchers are starting to zero in on the hardwiring that produces consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, consciousness is operationally defined as being aware of sensory stimulation, as opposed to just being awake. We are not conscious of everything we see and hear, nor of all of the information processing occurring in our own brains. We are aware of only a small subset of input and processing, which is woven together into a continuous and seamless narrative that we experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527520.400-firing-on-all-neurons-where-consciousness-comes-from.html?full=true"&gt;New Scientist has a good review of this topic&lt;/a&gt; – in which they discuss the work of Bernard Baars who proposed in 1987 the “global workspace theory.” Essentially, he hypothesized that conscious awareness stems from a discrete network of neurons that are widely distributed throughout the cortex. This networks receives input from the various sensory regions of the brain and puts it all together – filtering out any contradictory or unnecessary information to create one unified picture of reality in a continuous stream that we experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this model sensory input that gets filtered out of the global workplace remains subconscious, as is any processing that occurs in other parts of the brain but is filtered or not presented to the global workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baars also proposes that the global workspace can explain the dichotomy between the slow serial functioning of the conscious brain and the fast parallel processing of the brain as a whole. &lt;a href="http://theness.com/The%20difference%20is,%20of%20course,%20that%20most%20psychologists%20work%20with%20the%20limited%20capacity%20component%20of%20the%20nervous%20system,%20which%20is%20associated%20with%20consciousness%20and%20voluntary%20control,%20while%20neuroscientists%20work%20with%20the%20%22wetware%22%20of%20the%20nervous%20system,%20enormous%20in%20size%20and%20complexity,%20and%20%20unconscious%20in%20its%20detailed%20functioning.%20But%20what%20is%20the%20meaning%20of%20this%20dichotomy?+How+does+a+serial,+slow,+and+relatively+awkward+level+of+functioning+emerge+from+a+system+that+is+enormous+in+size,+relatively+fast-+acting,+efficient,+and+parallel?++That+is+the+key+question."&gt;He writes in his book on the topic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference is, of course, that most psychologists work with the limited capacity component of the nervous system, which is associated with consciousness and voluntary control, while neuroscientists work with the “wetware” of the nervous system, enormous in size and complexity, and  unconscious in its detailed functioning. But what is the meaning of this dichotomy? How does a serial, slow, and relatively awkward level of functioning emerge from a system that is enormous in size, relatively fast-acting, efficient, and parallel?  That is the key question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global workspace seemed like a reasonable hypothesis from the point of view of explaining existing observations and data, but there wasn’t a way to really test it, and so it remained in science limbo. Until recently, that is, when the new tools of neuroscience enabled neuroscientists to look at brain function to find the potential correlates of the global workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researcher led by Stanislas Dehaene of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, beginning in 2005, looked at a phenomenon known as inattention blindness. (For a fun demonstration of this, take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.quirkology.com/USA/Video_ColourChangingTrick.shtml"&gt;Richard Wiseman’s Color Changing Card Trick&lt;/a&gt;.) Basically, inattention (or inattentional) blindness occurs when we fail to notice something which is right in front of us. The information simply does not become part of our stream of consciousness. This seemed like a good opportunity to test the global workspace theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study they presented subjects with two streams of four letters. In some cases the subjects had to answer a question after the first stream, which distracted them and caused them to miss the second stream of letters.  In other cases they perceived both streams of letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases for 270 milliseconds the streams of letters resulted in the same neuronal activity (as measured by a 128 lead EEG). In the case when the subjects perceived the second string this initial activity was followed by a synchronized burst of activity in parts of the brain (frontal and parietal lobes) thought to be part of the global workplace. In cases where the subjects did not consciously perceive the letters there was no such activity – the neurons quieted down after 270 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this could mean is that the initial 270 milliseconds of activity represents the subconscious processing in the visual and visual association cortex, while the next phase of activity is conscious awareness of that stimulus by the global workspace. This experiment has been replicated with implanted electrodes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems there is about a 300 millisecond delay from perception to conscious awareness, and those stimuli we are consciously aware of result in activation of a distributed network of neurons, while those we are not aware of do not result in such activation. So far so good for the global workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just being awake should result from some basic level of activity in any consciousness network. In fact, this is what researchers have found – the default mode network (DMN) is the baseline activity in the network thought to be part of the global workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Laureys (yes, the same &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1596"&gt;Steven Laureys from facilitated communication infamy&lt;/a&gt;) hypothesized that if the DMN is part of the brain function that causes consciousness then we would expect the level of activity in the DMN to be greatest among healthy controls and those who are locked in (conscious but paralyzed), decreased in those with minimally conscious state, and decreased further in those in a vegetative state. &lt;a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/133/1/161"&gt;That is in fact what he found&lt;/a&gt; when he studied 14 patients with disorders of consciousness and 14 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating area of research which seems to be progressing nicely. Although the results should be considered preliminary, it is not surprising that researchers are finding that brain activity correlates with levels of consciousness and awareness. The global workspace and the brain regions now associated with it are a good candidate for the neural substrate of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious clinical application is an improved ability to diagnose by direct functional brain scanning which unresponsive patients are conscious and which have impaired consciousness, and to what degree. This could also lead to an important criterion for prognosis – who is likely to recover and who will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the basic neuroscience advance is interesting in its own right. Understanding why certain brain processes are conscious and others are not will take us a long way to building a model of overall brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269357495826"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22684">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/724b3294e17e6947</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Advice"/><category term="Atheist Parenting"/><category term="Coming Out"/><category term="General"/><category term="Richard Wade"/><title type="html">Ask Richard: Atheist Grandfather Kept At Arm’s Length</title><published>2010-03-23T15:00:42Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T15:00:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/23/ask-richard-atheist-grandfather-kept-at-arm%e2%80%99s-length/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a problem about my grandchildren that is similar to ct with the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/12/11/ask-richard-my-little-nephew-is-being-brainwashed-as-a-christian/"&gt;nephew who is being brainwashed&lt;/a&gt; by his Christian mother. I’m 68 years old, and have at last returned to the position I held as a teenager: atheism. I spent two decades as a conservative Christian and went to seminary for three years in my late 30’s.  I  served about as long as a pastor in a conservative Lutheran synod.  Having to study the Bible intensely, I realized I could not believe what was there and after a difficult struggle I acknowledged that I was an agnostic and left the church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older of my two sons was a very wild rebellious kid in his teenage years while I was in the ministry, and he was in his early 20’s after I first got out. He was a heavy user of alcohol and drugs like cocaine. Then in his mid-20’s he turned around completely, became sober and a devout fundamentalist Christian. I’ve never asked him, but I suspect that the religion may have come in through a 12 step program, and it may also have been the influence of his girl friend, whom he married soon after. They have given me three beautiful grandchildren, two boys aged 15 and 12, and a little girl now 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son and his wife changed their church because the first very conservative church was not fundamentalist enough for them. I don’t have any idea what religious ideas our grandchildren are being taught  because we see so little of them. We live a little more than 100 miles away, and they have not come to visit us once in the past 13 years, although they sometimes get more than half the distance to see her brother or a baseball game.  My son’s mother, my ex-wife, lives fairly near to them and does not get many more visits than I do, but it is much easier for her to drop in on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we only see the kids about 4 times a year, as it means a round trip drive of over 200 miles in one day. My wife and I cannot get away too frequently as we operate a large riding stable. I have often dropped broad hints about visiting us, and my son always responds, “maybe we will some day,” but it never happens. I sometimes feel like making a tart comment on the commandment to honor your mother and father, but I always bite my tongue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are always pleasant and genial when we visit. They seem to be excellent parents. There is no sign of corporal punishment. They spend a lot of time with the kids. The two older boys do well in school and are involved in sports, and all three are well-behaved without being little plaster saints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son and his wife do not thrust their religion on us beyond saying grace at meals, and I bow my head as I would to show respect for anyone’s beliefs. Equally, I do not say how I now feel about religion. They must suspect that my wife and I do not attend church. I’m a little uncomfortable about having to avoid these topics. It’s like tiptoeing through a theological minefield. However, I feel that it may not be safe to simply say, “I do not believe in God any more” as it might result in our being unwelcome to visit the children at all. It’s the kind of thing you can’t unsay once it is out in the open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the question of how to offer a counterpoise to the kids’ religious upbringing. The best I can do is to bring science-oriented presents. When the boys were younger, they got a number of dinosaur models and books on dinosaurs. I am happy to see that the two boys are presently interested in scientifically-oriented careers: math teacher and engineer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there is no good advice about this situation. I’m just slightly uncomfortable with it, and the world doesn’t always offer you an escape from your discomforts. However, I would be interested in hearing other opinions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freethinking Grandpa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Grandpa,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re helping your grandchildren about as well as you can.  I’ll talk more about that later.  I think the main source of your discontent is that you and your son are strangers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would expect there to be an irresistible magnetic attraction for two boys to Grandpa’s riding stable.  They would be constantly asking to come visit.  Your son would need an equally powerful reason to stay away and have to continually disappoint them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems very likely to me that he figured out long ago that you are no longer a believer, simply by knowing your history. You left the ministry when he was a young man. A painful struggle like that cannot be easily kept hidden.  Questions, even if unspoken, remain hanging in the air.  What happened? Your son may have put the clues together, or he may have candidly asked someone who knows you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So your atheism may not really be a secret, just something neither of you discuss. Since his religious taste runs in the very fundamentalist range, he possibly feels a bit personally threatened by it,  and more so regarding his kids.   But if he already knows, that means he &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; tolerate you visiting on his turf, where your time is limited by the long commute, and where he feels more in control.  If you want him to visit on your turf, you need to help him feel safer.  To do that, you need to talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with you that a wry remark about honoring thy mother and father would be counterproductive.  Instead, tell him a truth about yourself. Something like this in your own words:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Son, you haven’t visited us in 13 years, and it hurts.  You and your family are welcome here, but we are welcome in your home only for a few hours after a long drive, four times a year .  Is there anything I do or have done that keeps you away? If I have hurt or offended you, I cannot mend it if I don’t know what it is.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though he could easily reply, “No, there’s nothing wrong.” you have still put it out there. You have stated that his unresponsive neglect hurts and that you wish it were different, and you have been willing to make amends if it is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional distance between the two of you might have nothing to do with religion. The divorce from your first wife, his mother, or the tension during his wild and rebellious adolescence could still be loaded with hurt and anger.  If you were caught up in your struggle with your loss of faith just when he was at the worst of his struggle with his addictions, he might have felt that you weren’t there for him.  The timing of such things are neither person’s fault, but blame is often given, and often not &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re mostly afraid of losing the right to see your grandchildren, but that is not likely if you handle it well, by not attacking him or his beliefs, just sharing your own feelings &lt;em&gt;about your relationship.&lt;/em&gt;  If he broaches the subject of your atheism, then acknowledge it and reassure him that you have no intention of discussing your views with his kids, so there’s no need to keep them away for that reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grandpa, the tension that you feel tiptoeing around religious issues is fed by the importance that you give them. He believes what he believes. So what?  Let the weight of it fall from your relaxed fingers.  Such things should not perturb a man such as you, who has walked all the way through the belief gauntlet. Theism, atheism, these are insignificant trifles over which to sacrifice something so precious as love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People regret losing opportunities because they waited too long, and the saddest lost opportunity is the unsaid “I love you.” You’re 68, and by my figuring your son is in his mid 40’s. Both of you could live a long time, but neither of you can justify wasting time when love and closeness could have been shared and enjoyed.  With each passing day, his odds of sudden death get closer to your odds, not further.   Paradoxically, having less time can give us more freedom—to get past our fears that hold back our hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I think your science-oriented gifts to the boys and the little girl are right on target. Binoculars, microscopes, or just a hand held two lens loupe, one of my own childhood’s favorite toys, steer young minds toward a life of looking rather than just listening. Nothing too elaborate, just whatever you can afford and whatever they will enjoy.  Nourishing their curiosity is the treasure inside the gifts. Where that curiosity leads them religiously is up to them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some day as teens or young adults they may have their own doubts, just as you did. At least one and maybe all are likely to have inherited some of your personality traits. But you should leave it up to them. If they come to you needing some understanding about these issues, you can be Freethinking Grandpa for them. Otherwise you can still be just plain Grandpa for them.  &lt;/p&gt;

Watching the blogs and Twitter stream, it appears to have been better and more exciting than ever. I guess I'll have to figure out a way to finally get myself there next year....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this post is not really about SXSW. It is about presenting at such conferences. More specifically, how the back-channel (on Twitter and elsewhere) affects the way one needs to approach an invitation to speak at meetings where much of the audience is highly wired online: to say Yes or No to the invitation in the first place, and if Yes how to prepare and how to conduct oneself during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great example of this was the &lt;a href="http://www.futureofcontext.com/" title=""&gt;Future of Context&lt;/a&gt; panel at SXSW, with &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/" title=""&gt;Jay Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://mthomps.com/" title=""&gt;Matt Thompson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.tristanharris.com/about/" title=""&gt;Tristan Harris&lt;/a&gt;, moderated by &lt;a href="http://paidcontent.org/bio/3/" title=""&gt;Staci Kramer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the meeting ended, Jay Rosen described in great detail all the things they did to prepare for the session and how that all worked - go and read: &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2010/03/17/backchannel.html" title=""&gt;How the Backchannel Has Changed the Game for Conference Panelists&lt;/a&gt;. I will be sending the link to that post to all the speakers/panelists/presenters/moderators at ScienceOnline2011 once the program is set. That is definitely a post to bookmark and save if you are organizing a conference, or if you are ever invited to speak at one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes people who tend to speak at conferences that are not filled to the brim with the Twitterati. Even at such conferences, a small but loud proportion of your audience WILL tweet. Be prepared! Even if &lt;a href="http://jenleslie.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/the-sad-state-of-scientists-communicating-science/" title=""&gt;you are speaking at the AAAS meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other important things to think about - both for organizers and presenters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, public speaking is for some people the most terrifying thing they can ever be asked to do. But even those who are not completely terrified, may &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2010/03/presenting-minorities-and-the-token-skeptic-at-atheistcon/" title=""&gt;need some training&lt;/a&gt; in order to do well. Have new people be mentored by experienced speakers (I mentioned how we do that at ScienceOnline &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/01/making_it_real_people_and_book.php" title=""&gt;at the end of this post&lt;/a&gt;) by sharing the panel. As an organizer, work hard to help the new speakers to alleviate their fears, to make crystal-clear what is expected of them, to provide them support before, during and after their sessions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many organizers are hoping to increase diversity (of personal experiences and approaches, not just in terms of gender, race, age, ethnicity and such, though the diversity in the latter usually brings along the diversity in the former as well). They need to remember that announcing this intent is not enough. People who were not welcome at the table before have no reason to believe that they will be welcome now - so why bother. You have to do more - &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_2pm.php" title=""&gt;actively reach out and engage them&lt;/a&gt;. And, as your conference (like ScienceOnline) goes through years, if you are successful at bringing in the diverse groups to the table - they will notice. They will invite others to come next year. The meeting gains reputation, over the years, for being open and inclusive (nobody is a superstar and everybody is a superstar). Instead of being tokens, they become an integral part of the conference and help shape it. This takes work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the Back-channel &lt;a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/11/24/spectacle_at_we.html" title=""&gt;should never become the Front-channel&lt;/a&gt;!!!! Never display tweets on the screen behind the speaker. Never. On the other hand, please make it easy for the speakers to monitor the Twitterverse on their own computer screens if they want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, if you are organizing a conference, think hard about the format. At a typical scientific conference, the speaker is a scientist who is presenting new data. The talk is likely to have a level of complexity (as well as an arrow of the narrative) that is not served well by constant interruption. In such cases, a traditional format, with a Q&amp;amp;A period (long enough!) at the end is just fine. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/tedxrtp.php" title=""&gt;TED and TEDx conferences&lt;/a&gt; are similar. Quick presentations, like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/ignite_raleigh_2_and_tedxrtp_-.php" title=""&gt;Ignite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.themonti.org/" title=""&gt;storytelling events&lt;/a&gt; are similar - the presentations are too short and too well-rehearsed to be able to withstand interruptions.  But you &lt;a href="http://scienceinthetriangle.org/2009/11/rti-fellows-symposium-integrating-basic-and-applied-research/" title=""&gt;have to have a Q&amp;amp;A at the end - it is irresponsible not to have it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, many sessions at the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/02/aaas_2010_meeting_-_the_press.php" title=""&gt;AAAS meeting&lt;/a&gt; are three hours long!  Including &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/02/some_aaas_links.php" title=""&gt;my session&lt;/a&gt;. And in each one of those that I attended, the moderator announced at the beginning that the Q&amp;amp;A will be at the end. Hmmm, how many people will still be in the room after 2 hours and 40 minutes? They will be either long gone, or brain-dead and eager to leave. So we tried to do the best we could with the format we had - we had 2-3 people ask questions after each one of our presentations (there were six of us at the panel) as well as at the very end. And you know what - at the end of the third hour, the room was still full and we were still getting more questions. Engaging the audience early on got them excited. They wanted to stay in the room and engage some more, 2-3 of them every 20 minutes or so, and several more at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum to the one-to-many lecture is a fully-fledged &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/03/04/renewedEvangelismBloggerco.html" title=""&gt;Unconference format&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on the insight that "&lt;a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/03/05/what-is-an-unconference/" title=""&gt;The sum of the expertise of the people in the audience is greater than the sum of expertise of the people on stage.&lt;/a&gt;". This, of course, depends on the topic, the speaker, and the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I explained at length &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_2pm.php" title=""&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt; after ScienceOnline'09, and at even more length in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/how_to_organize_an_interactive.php" title=""&gt;this radio interview&lt;/a&gt; after ScienceOnline2010, our inaugural meeting in 2007 was a pure Unconference, but that we since decided to move to a hybrid format for a number of reasons I explained in both of these places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think, for example, of Workshops. We had a Blogging101 workshop at a different day, time and place in 07 and 08. We expanded the number of workshops in 2009 and had them as a part of the main program (just tagged as workshops), and then in 2010 we again moved them all to a different day, time and space to make it clear that these sessions are different - not Unconference-y in format, and for a good reason (we'll do the same next year). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Blogging101 workshop, for example, will have an experience blogger at the front. The audience will be full of people who have never blogged and want to learn how. The moderator is an expert, and acts as a teacher or trainer or 'fount of wisdom' to the audience who came to get exactly that - instruction. The audience expects to learn how to start a blog, how to post the first introductory post, how to make a link and insert a picture, how to build a blogroll and change the visual design of the blog from an existing set of choices. They also expect some sage advice on what is regarded as proper blogging behavior so they do not get instantly slammed when they enter the blogosphere for "doing it wrong". The kinds of questions such an audience asks are going to be calls for help and clarification, perhaps for more information. They are unlikely to insert their own opinions and information, or to challenge the session leader. It is more of a classroom lecture (or lab) than a freewheeling discussion. Yet is has its own usefulness and should not be looked down upon because it is not in an Unconference format. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, a Blogging102 workshop, where the audience already has some experience in blogging and is looking for tips and tricks for making their blogs better, looking better, and promoted better, there will be additional insights from the audience - which we saw at Scio10: that workshop was quite participatory and interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, there are demos. A demo is just 12 minutes long with additional 3 minutes reserved for Q&amp;amp;A. The presenter is showing off his/her website or software or what-not to people who have not seen it before and would like to see how it works. Again, interruption of such a short and carefully prepared presentation would not be a good thing. If you have more to discuss - grab the presenter in the hallway afterwards. We are thinking of moving the Demos (both 12-minute presentations and potentially stations or booths) to a different day/time/space next year as well. Nothing wrong with that format, but it is not in an Unconference spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, the bulk of our conference is an Unconference. And we have seen that well-prepared presenters can turn even large 4-5 person panels into lively discussions off the bat. I have described one such 2009 panel &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_2pm.php" title=""&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt; and there were several this year (most notably the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/02/journalism_wrap-up_from_scienc.php" title=""&gt;Rebooting Science Journalism&lt;/a&gt; session). What we tell both moderators and participants is that the name of the session is not a title of a lecture but the topic of the conversation for that hour. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who already have experience with the unconference format lead the way (we try to have such people lead the first morning sessions to set the tone for the rest of the event) and n00bs follow. Once everyone is in the swing of things and participating freely, it is easy to have a session be very informal. For example, last year Pete Binfield and Henry Gee started off their session with the question "Our topic is "A" - what do you want to talk about?". And that worked brilliantly as people who decided to attend that particular session already had questions and comments prepared in their minds and were ready to start discussing the topic right from the start. Other sessions require more of an intro, and that is OK as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the bottom line is that there is a spectrum of potential formats and each format has its pros and cons. The duration (from 5 minutes to 3 hours and everything in-between) will dictate how participatory the session can be. The relative difference between the expertise of the people on stage and the people in the audience is also a factor - more even they are, more participatory the session should be. As an organizer, always strive to have the sessions as participatory as the format/topic/people allows it, not less. Having less will diminish the experience - it will be seen as preaching down and trust will be lost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And keep the Back-channel in mind - people in the room are not the only people participating. Make sure that the people following on Twitter, or Ustream or SecondLife can participate to some extent as well - perhaps let the people/audience in the room (all of them or a few chosen individuals) be moderators of Twitter chatter, and ask the cameraman to introduce questions from the Ustream audience into the room. We did both at ScienceOnline2010 and the feedback from virtual audience was positive.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“She thinks blogging is ‘a guy thing’, like driving a snowmobile up a mountain ‘at 120 miles per hour’ is a guy thing (for James Bond maybe). According to Wente, women don’t share men’s urge to ‘&lt;strong&gt;spit out an opinion about current affairs every 20 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;‘. And, as all phenomena in the (post)modern world are explained, Wente says the blogging gender divide is caused by a syndrome: ‘Male Answer Syndrome’. This ’sexual’ syndrome explains everything apparently, from boys putting their hands up before girls in Maths lessons (do they??) to women being quiet at dinner parties (are they??), to women’s so-called inhibitions about writing stuff and posting it online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An international day of blogging (videologging, podcasting, comic drawing etc.!) to draw attention to the achievements of women in technology and science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which – the podcast for &lt;a href="http://skepticallyspeaking.com/"&gt;Skeptically Speaking&lt;/a&gt; which features Heidi Anderson (the creator of &lt;a href="http://shethought.com/"&gt;SheThought&lt;/a&gt;) is now out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aauw.org/research/whysofew.cfm"&gt;Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In an era when women are increasingly prominent in medicine, law and business, why are there so few women scientists and engineers? A new research report by AAUW presents compelling evidence that can help to explain this puzzle. &lt;em&gt;Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics&lt;/em&gt; presents in-depth yet accessible profiles of eight key research findings that point to environmental and social barriers – including stereotypes, gender bias and the climate of science and engineering departments in colleges and universities – that continue to block women’s participation and progress in science, technology, engineering, and math.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;SAS Hall, North Campus, April 10th, 4:00 pm 	

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scope/Harrelson Lecture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker Neal Lane, Malcolm Gillis University Professor at Rice University and senior fellow of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, presents: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;America's Science Challenges and Opportunities: Past, Present and Future&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, especially since World War II, has been powered by science, engineering and technology. The rationale for the federal government's large investment in research was originally WWII and the cold war that followed. But in recent decades the emphasis has shifted to health and medicine and, more recently, energy, technological innovation and the economy. This talk will review a bit of the history, describe some current challenges and opportunities and offer speculation on possible futures for American science and implications for the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has spotted Soviet lunar robots on the Moon, relics from the original Space Race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/LRO_USSR_landers.jpg" alt="LRO_USSR_landers" title="LRO_USSR_landers" width="610" height="304"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is the LRO image of the &lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/198-Soviet-Union-Lunar-Rovers.html"&gt;Luna 17 lander&lt;/a&gt;, which touched down on the Moon’s surface in late 1970, delivering the Lunakhod 1 rover (which eventually traveled over 10 km (6 miles) across the Moon’s surface). &lt;a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/202-Luna-21-Lander.html"&gt;The image on the right&lt;/a&gt; is of Luna 21, which set the Lunakhod 2 rover down in 1973. Note the higher scale, which clearly shows the tracks of the rover as it moved around its base station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; cool! And if you go to those links, there are closeups from the Soviet landers showing what the view looked like from the surface of the Moon all those decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for an added bit of coolness, Universe Today’s Nancy Atkinson dug up the story that both rovers were used by the Soviets &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2010/03/19/did-you-know-russian-lunokhod-rovers-created-memorials-on-the-moon-honoring-women/"&gt;to celebrate International Women’s Day&lt;/a&gt;. I’m old enough to remember how the Soviets were vilified by the American government… and while some of it may have been deserved, they were not the monsters they were portrayed as. I think Nancy’s story is an important one. We may have been opponents in the race to the Moon, and deadly enemies back on Earth, but we’re also all humans. At least in that respect, nothing has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“There have been a few offers to help move the items which have not been damaged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you to all for such offers, however, there are several safety concerns which need to be assessed before anyone can go back into the building.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1973486,00.html"&gt;A recent article in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1973486,00.html"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; looks at various examples of alleged animal suicide, taking as its starting point the recent distressing film about Japanese slaughter of dolphins, The Cove. Animal-rights activist Richard O’Barry, who features in The Cove, is convinced that animals can commit suicide, having allegedly seen Kathy, a dolphin in the 1960s television show Flipper, sink to the bottom of her tank and stop breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take the discussion onto a rather more rigorous level, the article references a recent piece by a colleague of mine, Dr Duncan Wilson from the University of Manchester’s Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine. Together with Edmund Ramsden from Exeter, Duncan has just published an article in the history of science magazine &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6V81-4YBVN1G-1&amp;amp;_user=494590&amp;amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2010&amp;amp;_rdoc=9&amp;amp;_fmt=high&amp;amp;_orig=browse&amp;amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235857%232010%23999659998%231701095%23FLA%23display%23Volume)&amp;amp;_cdi=5857&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;_ct=12&amp;amp;_acct=C000024058&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=494590&amp;amp;md5=11981d40db096c6bb594f8deb499a628"&gt;Endeavour&lt;/a&gt; (subscription required – NB this link has now been fixed), looking at how animal “suicide” has been interpreted through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drs Ramsden and Wilson go back to Aristotle’s story of a stallion that threw itself over a cliff when it realised it had inadvertently mated with its mother (this seems rather unlikely, in my opinion), but concentrate on 19th century views of animal suicide, and convincingly show that accounts of animal suicide  reflect the values of the society in which they are recounted. In particular, during the 19th century, “Humane groups such as the Royal Society for Protection of Animals (RSPCA) seized upon popular accounts to claim that animals shared with humans the capacities for grief, love, despair – and, moreover, that they possessed enough intelligence to plan and execute their own deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of cunning experiments were carried out as part of the growing debate over the nature of animal behaviour – are animals conscious, or is their behaviour “instinctive”? The paragraph on scorpions is worth citing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;“Romanes relayed several accounts where scorpions had killed themselves after being ringed with fire, but noted cautiously, ‘such a remarkable fact unquestionably demands further corroboration before we accept it unreservedly.’ E. Ray Lankester, professor of zoology at University College, London, took up the challenge and, reporting to the Linnaean Society late in 1882, claimed that he had observed a scorpion repeatedly trying to strike itself after he administered chloroform into its glass container. This he believed to ‘throw light on the old tradition’, and tended ‘to confirm its accuracy.’ In 1883, Morgan endeavoured to dispel this belief. He designed a set of experiments ‘sufficiently barbarous…to induce any scorpion who had the slightest suicidal tendency to find relief in self-destruction.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;He surrounded them with fire, condensed sunbeams on their backs, heated them in a bottle, burned them with phosphoric acid, treated them with electric shocks and subjected them to ‘general and exasperating courses of worry.’ Though he witnessed scorpions striking at their backs, this, Morgan explained, was an instinctive attempt to remove irritation. Those who ignored or rejected this fact were ‘not accustomed to accurate observation.’ In 1887, Alfred Bourne provided further evidence that questioned ‘the phenomenon so graphically delineated by Byron’. Scorpions, he claimed, were immune to their own venom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Ramsden and Wilson’s article is to show how attitudes to animal suicide have changed over time, and have been shaped by the overall views of any given society: “Through shifting archetypes of animal suicide, we can trace the history of perspectives on self-destruction – we see the victim and hero of ancient philosophy and romanticism, the martyr or sinner of the Judeo-Christian tradition, the automaton and the neurotic, lost amongst the masses of modernity. When scientists, philosophers, writers or theologians have reflected upon the nature of suicide, they have, persistently, reflected on the natural world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave one of the real, solid examples of animal “suicide” – the worker bee stinging a perceived threat, but dying in the process? The bee’s sting is famously barbed, and as the bee tries to fly away, it pulls out its innards, including the venom gland which not only continues to pulse venom down the sting, but also releases alarm pheromones which attract other bees. The downside is that the bee dies. This video shows the process, and how to get a sting out (it takes an awful lot to provoke the poor bee into stinging…):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/do-animals-commit-suicide/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/g5cHvOti7cg/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explanation for this behaviour is that the bee is protecting its hive, and thereby its genes. Worker bees are generally sterile (though they can produce male eggs under certain circumstances), so the only way it can make a genetic contribution to the next generation is by helping the hive, with which it shares a high proportion of its genes. From a gene’s eye view, this is not suicide at all, but merely the death of one carrier of those genes, to preserve the life of many more carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So – apart from the examples of social insects, DO animals commit suicide?&lt;/p&gt;

For example, there is the line attributed to J.B.S. Haldane in response to the question of what can be inferred about the Creator from a study of nature: that He has “an inordinate fondness for beetles.”  Similarly, when asked if it is true that only three people understand relativity, Sir Arthur Eddington is said to have replied “Who is the third?”.  These particular examples may be apocryphal, of course, but they do convey some important points about nature or the difficulty in understanding complex scientific theories.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a recent post on &lt;a href="http://evolvingthoughts.net/2010/03/23/a-quote-on-philosophers-and-evolution/"&gt;Evolving Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, I have decided to start a collection of quotes dealing with the fact that evolution, despite being deceptively simple and thought to be well-understood by many, is actually grasped by a very small percentage of people (and I include most biologists in this claim).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another curious aspect of the theory of evolution is that everybody thinks he understands it. I mean philosophers, social scientists, and so on. While in fact very few people understand it, actually, as it stands, even as it stood when Darwin expressed it, and even less as we now may be able to understand it in biology.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jacques Monod 1975, in &lt;em&gt;Problems of Scientific Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evolution is so simple almost anyone can misunderstand it.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;David Hull, [&lt;a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/"&gt;source under investigation!&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of us are happy to admit that we do not understand, say, string theory in physics, yet we are all convinced we understand evolution … Evolution must be the best-known yet worst-understood of all scientific theories.”&lt;br&gt;
…&lt;br&gt;
“If you think you understand [evolution], you don’t know nearly enough about it.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Michael LePage 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13620?DCMP=NLC-nletter&amp;amp;nsref=dn13620"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Evolution] was one of those focal points of debate on which practically everybody was compelled to have some sort of opinion. Needless to say, the opinion cannot in most cases be called an informed one. Only a small proportion of those who took sides one way or the other had even a rudimentary knowledge of the facts on which the theory was based.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alvar Ellegard 1958, &lt;em&gt;Darwin and the General Reader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neo-Humanist&lt;/em&gt;?  Do we really need another label in our community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a term Kurtz coined to encapsulate the following traits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Neo-Humanists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li value="1"&gt;aspire to be more inclusive by appealing to both non-religious and religious humanists and to religious believers who share common goals; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="2"&gt;are critical of theism;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="3"&gt;are best defined by what they are for, not what they are against;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="4"&gt;wish to use critical thinking, evidence, and reason to evaluate claims to knowledge;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="5"&gt;apply similar considerations to ethics and values;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="6"&gt;are committed to a key set of values: happiness, creative actualization, reason in harmony with emotion, quality, and excellence; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="7"&gt;emphasize moral growth (particularly for children), empathy, and responsibility;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="8"&gt;advocate the right to privacy;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="9"&gt;support the democratic way of life, tolerance, and fairness; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="10"&gt;recognize the importance of personal morality, good will, and a positive attitude toward life; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="11"&gt;accept responsibility for the well-being of society, guaranteeing various rights, including those of women, racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities; and supporting education, health care, gainful employment, and other social benefits; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="12"&gt;support a green economy; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="13"&gt;advocate population restraint, environmental protection, and the protection of other species; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="14"&gt;recognize the need for Neo-Humanists to engage actively in politics; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="15"&gt;take progressive positions on the economy; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li value="16"&gt;hold that humanity needs  to move beyond ego-centric individualism and chauvinistic nationalism to develop transnational planetary institutions to cope with global problems—such efforts include a strengthened World Court, an eventual World Parliament, and a Planetary Environmental Monitoring Agency that would set standards for controlling global warming and ecology. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure a lot of us agree with many of those ideas, but does it mean we should adopt the neologism and statement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ron Lindsay&lt;/strong&gt;, who occupies Kurtz’s former post at CFI, &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/atheism_humanism_and_the_neo-humanist_statement/"&gt;isn’t signing onto this statement&lt;/a&gt; (in his capacity as a private individual) for a few reasons, the foremost of which is the attack on atheism coming from someone on our own side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One major problem is the Statement’s aggressive criticism of atheism or the “new atheism.” Looking at the abstract for the Statement, one finds the startling assertion that: “On the one end of the spectrum are traditional religious beliefs; on the other the ‘New Atheism.’” This equation of traditional religious belief with the new atheism is inappropriate and tendentious; it implies that the new atheism is as dogmatic and as pernicious to humanity as traditional religious belief.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.paulkurtz.us/documents/appendix.html"&gt;appendix to Kurtz’s statement&lt;/a&gt; is indeed very harsh about “new atheism”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A new challenge has emerged today to confront secular humanism; for several secular authors have advocated “the new atheism.” These include Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Victor Stenger. They insist that there is sufficient evidence for atheism and urge that secular humanists aggressively advocate the view that “God does not exist,” that the classical religions are false, that people who believe in them are deceived, and that their ethical values are also false.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit is just not true.  Religious people can hold ethical values.  The “new atheists” argue that those values are not ethical because they come from a god, but they may be ethical for other reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsay raises a few other issues, too, like vagueness on some issues (i.e. “green economy”) and impracticality on others (i.e. “World Parliament”).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who read it thoroughly can help us out by highlighting some of the more important parts of it as well as any major problems you come across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, this type of thing is possibly interesting to philosophers but completely irrelevant to me. It’s not like my views about the world are now happily codified or that I’m going to start calling myself a Neo-Humanist.  It also doesn’t change what I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why bother with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, is there anything new in the statement that justifies there even being a “statement”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preamble to it ends this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… this Neo-Humanist Statement of Secular Principles and Values is offered as a constructive contribution to the planetary community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the sentiment is honorable, I just don’t know who would be affected by this.  Nor do I think the “planetary community” cares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, I’m also not someone who cared much about any of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_Manifesto"&gt;Humanist Manifestos&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe I’m not the right person to ask about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think about Kurtz’s statement?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She claimed to have done real SCIENCE to back this up, so I thought it only fair to attempt to replicate her results. Since she has asked all her followers to also do the experiment and post results, I’m asking my audience of scientists (pro and amateur alike) to have a go using proper blinding and controls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/-aUQzJSpz3s%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve set up a &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=111011592249703"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; where you can post your results. As I mention in the video (above), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/redirect?username=rkwatson&amp;amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Falbum.php%3Faid%3D186333%26id%3D557147572&amp;amp;video_id=-aUQzJSpz3s&amp;amp;event=url_redirect&amp;amp;url_redirect=True&amp;amp;usg=QHJwZnAEzbioZtjmUyao2v76GFU="&gt;Nikki has also posted pics on her page&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not a group page so she controls all the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the jump, see what Nikki’s fans are saying about me! I’ve also posted the transcript of the video. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Picture-1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Picture-1-300x279.png" alt="" title="Picture 1" width="300" height="279"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite is that someone thinks the mustaches on the jars will affect the results. If it’s that easy, just wear a mustache to bed every night and wake up looking like a million bucks! Forget Nikki Owens’ seminars (£595); just invest in my mustache set (&lt;del&gt;£1&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;£30&lt;/del&gt; £50)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, though, I did choose the most hateful mustache I had for the hate apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the Daily Fail published an article in which some moron named Nikki Owen told the world that saying nice things to yourself in the mirror will make you prettier. Nikki claims this is backed up by science, because she did an experiment with apples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikki’s experiment involved cutting an apple into pieces and placing each piece in a different jar. She said mean things to one apple and nice things to the other apple, and after one week the hate apple was more decayed than the love apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you a moment for that to sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikki says that apples and the human body are both 60% water. This isn’t true…for humans, it’s anywhere from 45 to 75% with an average percentage of about 57, and for apples it’s about 85%, but let’s ignore reality for a moment and go back to Nikki. Because apples are pretty much the same as faces, she says that her experiment proves being nice to your face will make it better looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her little theory is based on Dr Emoto, a guy who published a thoroughly debunked study in which he spoke to water crystals in petrie dishes and found that nicer words made prettier crystals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to test Nikki’s hypothesis myself. First I bought three nice jars from the local 99-pence store, a magical place that also sold a whole pack of mustaches for the low low price of 99 pence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I found a nice, fresh, bruise-free Gala apple at my local farmer’s market and cut it into quarters. One piece would be the love apple, one would be the hate apple, and the other would be the control apple of indifference. The fourth quarter was smeared with peanut butter and consumed, marking yet another way that human faces are different from apples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I talked to my apples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TO HATE APPLE]&lt;br&gt;
Apple, I never really thought you would come to much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TO LOVE APPLE]&lt;br&gt;
Apple, you look marvelous today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TO APPLE OF INDIFFERENCE]&lt;br&gt;
Hey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll do this every day and I’ll  film it, and at the end of the week I’ll show you the results. You can decide which apple looks the worse for wear, and then I’ll reveal which apple is which.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like, you can play along. Upload your own video as a response to this one, just please remember to use a control apple and let someone who doesn’t know which apple is which tell you which looks better. I’ve also started a Facebook page where you can upload pics if you’d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikki’s followers have posted their own successful anecdotes on her Facebook page, so I’d like to see if skeptics using proper controls come to the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269339093324"><id gr:original-id="http://neurotonics.blogspot.com/2010/03/who-isnt-afraid-of-alzheimers.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/95825add02cab280</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Who *isn&amp;#39;t* afraid of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s?</title><published>2010-03-23T04:44:17Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T04:44:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/9yfbqDmfjIQ/who-isnt-afraid-of-alzheimers.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://neurotonics.blogspot.com/2010/03/who-isnt-afraid-of-alzheimers.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I have found microglia interesting to learn about in the past, and have written here, here, here, here, and here, about their proposed relationship to pain.Yesterday I saw a news story about researchers in Germany who carefully studied the relationship between microglia and neurons undergoing Alzheimer-like changes in mice, Dangerous custodians: Immune cells as possible nerve-cell killers in  Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease, and was immediately intrigued.An advance online publication of the paper, Microglial Cx3cr1 knockout prevents  neuron loss in a mouse model of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease, is freely accessible, at least for now.That stressed neurons exude the chemokine, fractalkine, or that this substance attracts microglia, isn&amp;#39;t fresh news. Like a bunch of little cellular opportunists, microglia catch the &amp;quot;scent&amp;quot; and begin moving toward it. Like any bunch of scavengers converging on a picnic, in this case, the amyloid-β forming and piling up, they also secrete/excrete (while gorging and multiplying, I suppose). What they signal/secrete/excrete isn&amp;#39;t really explained, but what is news, is that it, or else just the sheer numbers of microglia converging, apparently sickens the affected neurons even more, kills them, according to this story.In the paper, the authors, Fuhrmann etal., state, &amp;quot;In Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease, microglia represent a double-edged sword. On the  one hand, microglia can have a beneficial effect by secreting  neurotrophic factors and phagocytosing amyloid beta (Aβ)2, the latter of which remains  controversial3. On the other hand, microglia may also be  neurotoxic4.  Little is known about the neurotoxic role of microglia in Alzheimer&amp;#39;s  disease. Human peripheral blood monocytes that are stimulated with Aβ  induce neuron loss in vitro5. Neurons  cultured without microglia are resistant to Aβ-induced neurotoxicity6.&amp;quot; The authors decided to interfere, genetically, with the receptors in the microglia that allow them to sense fractalkine; CX3CR1, &amp;quot;the unique receptor for fractalkine/CX3CL1,  which is expressed in neurons and presumably acts as a membrane-bound  adhesion molecule and/or cleaved chemoattractant and is important for  recruiting CX3CR1-expressing microglia to injured neurons9, 10.&amp;quot;They managed to show that it was definitely the microglia causing the neuron death, not any other factor. Furthermore, knocking out the ability of microglia to &amp;quot;smell&amp;quot; fractalkine didn&amp;#39;t seem to interfere with their ability to clear the amyloid material associated with Alzheimer&amp;#39;s. Moreover, the same treatment of the microglial receptor gives inconclusive results in other kinds of conditions - only in Alzheimer&amp;#39;s does it seem to be a helpful intervention.Supplementary information for this paper.Fuhrmann,  M., Bittner, T., Jung, C., Burgold, S., Page, R., Mitteregger, G.,  Haass, C., LaFerla, F., Kretzschmar, H., &amp;amp; Herms, J.

&lt;p&gt;During the debate Deepak claimed that the moon is nothing more than a soup of teaming quantum uncertainty. No. Subatomic particles may be altered when they are observed, but the moon is there even if no one looks at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepak wrote a thoughtful response to this blog (on his Blackberry while running on a treadmill with his agile thumbs no less!):&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you see an object, the moon being the example you chose, your eyes are not really “seeing” the moon. Your eyes are responding to photons that follow all the rules of wave-particle duality. The electro-chemical reaction in your rods and cones sends an electrical current to your brain, an action potential that goes to your occipital cortex where it is registered as a particular intensity and pattern of electrical firings in your synaptic networks. No image entered your eyes, no image enters your neural networks. Yet you see the moon in your consciousness. There was no moon till it was an experience in your consciousness. Your brain is not registering pictures of the moon. It is sensing a digital on-off code of photons or waves of electricity (same thing) The collapse of wave function that creates the moon is in your consciousness (that has no location because its non local) The moon exists in consciousness — no consciousness, no moon — just a sluggishly expanding wave function in a superposition of possibilities. All happens within consciousness and nowhere else. In fact, the sluggishly expanding possibility wave function is also within consciousness. The same principle applies to any macro object including your own body. That’s why I said on Larry King that you are not in your body, the body is in you. You are not in the world, the world is in you. You are not in your mind (thoughts are possibility waves till experienced in consciousness) the mind is in you. This “you” of course is not a person. It is what Stuart Hameroff (whom you quoted in your blog as generating heat but not light — alas they are the same thing — light and heat:)) says  in an upcoming interview: “I think  a fundamental field of protoconscious experience has been embedded all along — since the big bang — in the (quantum realm) and that biology evolved and adapted in order to access it and maximize the qualities and potentials implicit within it — this could be the basic fabric of the universe.” Take care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Shermer&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I agree with nearly everything you say here, except that the moon would exist even if there were no humans to observe it. If all life on earth were instantly eradicated by a rogue asteroid, the moon would continue on its merry way about what would be left of the shattered earth. In fact, even if there were no life anywhere in the cosmos, all those galaxies of stars would still be there. Do you disagree with that position? That reality exists separate from us observers? Otherwise, wouldn’t that just be solipsism?&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Deepak&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I disagree. Let’s take a simpler example. Let’s say your looking at a rose, a beautiful red one. What does it look like to a honey bee? The honey bee has no receptors for the usual wave lengths of light that you and I sense. It responds to ultraviolet so I don’t know what the experience of a rose to a honey bee but it has some experience, it is drawn to the flower and in fact makes honey out of it. What about a bat who can perhaps sense it as the echo of ultrasound. I don’t know what that experience is like either because I’m not a bat. What about a chameleon whose eyeballs swivel on 2 different axes? I can’t even remotely imagine what that object looks like to a chameleon. There are innumerable species who because of the nature of their sensory apparatus have a different experience of that rose. The senses do not see a rose. They register electricity! The neurons do not see a rose, they sense ionic shifts. What is the real look of the rose? There is no such thing! It depends on whose looking and also the instruments of observation — in this case the instrument of observation is the nervous system. (Of course that’s where you and I differ because you say you are your nervous system and I say you are the user of your nervous system.) Who is looking? A non-material observer. What is it looking at? It is looking at possibility waves that collapse as space time events in its own consciousness. That non-local observer is a single observer in all these different observations. Schroedinger: “Consciousness is a singular that has no plural.” You are the eyes of the universe looking at itself as a rose or the moon! Rumi: “Let the waters settle and you will see stars and the moon mirrored in your own being.” Every sentient biological entity is a singular consciousness looking at itself as a particular object. The observer and observed are the same being. The history of the cosmos is a history that is conceived in a particular way as if we were there or other biological organisms were there to observe it. But just as you cannot have an electrical current without a +ve and -ve terminal in place, you can’t have an object unless there is consciousness and a collapse of wave function to create that experience. There is now also a field called “time symmetric quantum mechanics” that says that information from the future fills in the indeterminacies of the present.” In other words the universe evolves teleologically.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, Deepak, I think I understand the core of our disagreement: you are placing epistemology over ontology — how we know reality over reality itself. I think this is a result of your metaphysics and the worldview with which you begin. Since I privilege ontology over epistemology — reality over how we know reality — my conclusions will inevitably be different from your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Larry King you stated: “There are traditions that say the in-body experience is a socially induced collective hallucination. We do not exist in the body. The body exists in us. We do not exist in the world. The world exists in us.” I wrote in my True/Slant blog that I didn’t understand this. Now I think I do after reading you more carefully. For you, the first-person “I” perspective is primary. As in your example with the rose, without rods and cones to transduce the photons of light bouncing off the rose into neuronal action potentials that register in a visual cortex, there is no rose. Of course, I could just as easily argue that without the rose there would be no photons to transduce into action potentials to register on a visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So … which is the right perspective: reality first or I/self first? Reality takes precedence over self. Why? Here is one answer. Look at this photograph of the 36-inch Crossley reflecting telescope at the Lick Observatory, which I visited the day before our Caltech debate. It was through this telescope that the mysterious spiral nebulae were first imaged well enough for astronomers to conclude that they represent “island universes” (galaxies) far away from our own galaxy, and are not developing solar systems within the Milky Way. But the “imaged” nebulae did not register on anyone’s retina (or visual cortex): it was imaged on a spectrographic plate — a machine, not a brain. And those photons would register in that machine even if every human on earth disappeared that night.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michael Shermer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269335120911"><id gr:original-id="http://talkingbrains.blogspot.com/2010/03/mirror-neurons-support-action.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b0b099dde50b3b90</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Mirror neurons support action understanding -- &amp;quot;from the inside&amp;quot;?</title><published>2010-03-23T04:18:19Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T04:18:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/3uJLL9VA66E/mirror-neurons-support-action.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://talkingbrains.blogspot.com/2010/03/mirror-neurons-support-action.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">I think we are getting closer to understanding what mirror neurons are doing.  No longer is it claimed that mirror neurons are THE basis for &amp;quot;action understanding&amp;quot;.  Now, according to Rizzolatti &amp;amp; Sinigaglia&amp;#39;s new review (2010), there are several non-mirror mechanisms that can accomplish this:We conclude that, although there are several mechanisms through which one can understand the behaviour of other individuals...Mirror neurons do something else (R&amp;amp;S would probably prefer the term, more, but else is better I think)the parieto-frontal mechanism is the only one that allows an individual to understand the action of others &amp;#39;from the inside&amp;#39;Let me explain what &amp;quot;from the inside&amp;quot; means, or at least provide an alternative to whatever R&amp;amp;S mean by it.  In my &amp;quot;Eight Problems&amp;quot; paper (Hickok, 2009) I noted that I can understand the action of saxophone playing even though I&amp;#39;ve never performed the actions associated with saxophone playing. R&amp;amp;S acknowledge that, indeed, I do understand the action of saxophone playing, and do so without the benefit of mirror neurons. But they suggest my understanding is lacking something, namely that extra bit of knowledge that comes from knowing how to play a saxophone.  So recognizing an action that I know how to perform = basic action understanding from non-mirror systems + mirror neuron-driven knowledge that hey I know how to make MY motor system do that! In other words, mirror neurons support the knowledge of how to perform an action that one is observing -- that is, mirror neurons are part of the same old &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; stream that vision neuroscientists, and more recently auditory neuroscientists have been working on for more than a decade (Milner &amp;amp; Goodale, 1995).  The &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; stream, of course, supports sensory-motor integration, or in R&amp;amp;S&amp;#39;s terms, action understanding &amp;quot;from the inside&amp;quot;.  This is why you see motor activation during the perception of actions that you can perform: it is sensory-motor association.Importantly, notice that there is no magical semantic knowledge that suddenly falls from heaven when we know how to perform an action. I can teach you a new word, glemph, and you can learn to reproduce it with your vocal tract so that subsequent presentations of acoustic glemph will activate your motor system by association. I could do the same with a sign language gesture. It doesn&amp;#39;t take on meaning until you link the sensory-motor ensemble to a conceptual structure.  So for example, I could define glemph (or the sign language equivalent) as &amp;#39;the act of publishing on the topic of mirror neurons&amp;#39;. Now, the sensory-motor ensemble has meaning and you understand it, but does that mean that the meaning and the understanding is now suddenly coded or even augmented by the sensory-motor ensemble itself? Put differently, do you now have a different understanding of the concept, &amp;#39;the act of publishing on the topic of mirror neurons&amp;#39; just because you have a new sensory-motor associate of the concept? No, you just know how to articulate the word that is associated with the concept.I suggest that this interpretation of &amp;quot;understanding from the inside&amp;quot; explains every mirror neuron-related observation, does so more parsimoniously than Rizzolatti&amp;#39;s account, and has more empirical support from research on aphasia and apraxia.ReferencesHickok G (2009).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/catholic-wmds.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="catholic WMDs" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/catholic-wmds.jpg?w=209&amp;amp;h=300" alt="" width="209" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2010/03/22/donohue-defends-catholic-church/"&gt;Bill Donohue defends child rapists…again&lt;/a&gt; – It seems like &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/examiner/x-9090-NY-Atheism--Skepticism-Examiner~y2009m5d25-Catholic-leaders-downplaying-abuse"&gt;only a year ago &lt;/a&gt;that Donohue was defending child rapists in Ireland for decades of abuse. Now he’s being a child rapist apologist once again, making the same fallacious and erroneous argument that was made by Andrew Brown, that the Catholic Church has no greater amount of institutionalized child rape than many other unnamed organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers from every walk of life, in both the U.S. and Europe, have  long handled cases of alleged sex abuse by employees as an internal  matter. Rarely have employers called the cops, and none was required to  do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course no examples are provided. I wonder if Donohue knows that we’re talking about half a million raped children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/J5JmpfG0RvY%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s only that we know of. Anyway, Greta Christina did a far better job of ripping this argument to shreds than I can right now so check out &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/03/andrew-brown-catholic-child-rape.html"&gt;her response to Andrew Brown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of those times. So enjoy this bit of Classic Insolence from back in November 2007 and be assured that I'll be back tomorrow. Remember, if you've been reading less than two and a half years, it's new to you, and, even if you have been reading more than two and a half years, it's fun to see how posts like this have aged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had thought of this one, but I didn't. However, I never let a little thing like not having thought of an idea first to stop me from discussing it, and this particular idea is definitely worth expanding upon because (1) it's interesting and (2) it combines two of my interests, alternative medicine and evolution. I agree with parts of the idea, but it's not without its shortcomings. Indeed, I'd very much welcome any of the evolutionary biologists who read this blog to chime in with their own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow ScienceBlogger Martin Rundkvist over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2007/11/selection_pressure_on_altie_me.php"&gt;Aardvarchaeology&lt;/a&gt; has proposed a rather fascinating idea regarding the evolution of alternative medicine in which he argues that alternative medicine evolves according to certain selective pressures. As you may or may not know, evolution is not just for biology, but has been proposed as a mechanism in cultural memes, for example. Since alternative medicine is a cultural phenomenon, it is not unreasonable to look at such non-evidence-based medicine and hypothesize what might be the selective pressures that shape its popularity and evolution. After all, if we're going to discourage the use of non-evidence-based medicine or even quackery, it's helpful to understand it. We already know that alt-med terminology has &lt;a href="http://www.imacjohnstown.org/cam/evolution/evolution.htm"&gt;evolved considerably&lt;/a&gt; into the current politically correct term "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/selective_pressures_and_the_evolution_of_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/selective_pressures_and_the_evolution_of_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/kEZVFISdVVs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269328020430"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4240">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8094dee9b7adbfe3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Herbs &amp; Supplements"/><category term="Dream Water"/><category term="GABA"/><category term="insomnia"/><category term="labelling"/><category term="melatonin"/><category term="proprietary secrets"/><category term="sleep remedies"/><category term="truth in advertising"/><category term="tryptophan"/><title type="html">A Sleep Remedy with Proprietary Secrets</title><published>2010-03-23T07:00:07Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T07:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4240" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new product, &lt;a href="http://www.drinkdreamwater.com/"&gt;Dream Water&lt;/a&gt;, is designed to help one relax, fall asleep and improve the quality of sleep using the all natural ingredients melatonin, GABA and 5-HTP (tryptophan). A single-dose 2.5 oz bottle retails for $2.99. They also offer a more dilute formulation in an 8 oz bottle. They suggest drinking half a bottle, keeping it at your bedside, and drinking more if you wake during the night. What dosage will you get from half a bottle? From a whole bottle? There’s no way to know. They offer a money back guarantee, free shipping, free samples, and lots of testimonials; but they refuse to disclose how much of what is in their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSHEA only permits structure and function claims like “supports prostate health,” but this product is clearly being promoted as a remedy for insomnia. The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/03/quack_miranda_warning.php"&gt;“Quack Miranda warning”&lt;/a&gt; is not displayed on the home page, but the “Dream Responsibly” page says “These statements have NOT been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is NOT intended to diagnose, treat, prevent or cure any disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it legal to sell this as a remedy for insomnia? I guess the legality depends on whether you define insomnia as a disease. Maybe they define it as an impairment in a function that needs supporting. Maybe they can get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the scientific evidence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a “perfect blend” of three ingredients that they say produce relaxation and sleep. Do these three natural medicines really work for insomnia? I looked up the ingredients in &lt;em&gt;The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melatonin&lt;/strong&gt;: For primary insomnia, melatonin reduces the time it takes to fall asleep by 12 minutes but does not improve sleep efficiency. There have been reports of adverse effects like elevated blood pressure and increased bleeding tendency in patients taking Coumadin. There are concerns about possible interactions with 11 categories of drugs, from antidiabetes drugs to contraceptives. The Dream Water website doesn’t mention any of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tryptophan&lt;/strong&gt; is rated as “possibly unsafe” and there is “insufficient reliable evidence to rate” effectiveness for insomnia. There is a long list of possible interactions with several other categories of drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GABA&lt;/strong&gt; – insomnia is not even on the NMCD’s list of things that “people use this for.” They found insufficient reliable information about safety and effectiveness to even give it a rating. We don’t think GABA even crosses the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inquiring Minds Want to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote their representative and asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m wondering about the dosage. Can you tell me how much melatonin, tryptophan and GABA are in each bottle? Have any placebo-controlled studies been done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot share specifics as the formula is proprietary. We also don’t have any formal placebo testing as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re suggesting that I use something with an unknown amount of active drugs, something that has not been properly tested, and that I simply take your word for it that the company has found a “perfect blend” without knowing how they found it or what exactly they found? No thanks, I’m not that gullible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I completely understand your concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gee, knowing that she understands makes me feel so much better….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Standard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.consumerlab.com/"&gt;ConsumerLab&lt;/a&gt; tests dietary supplements to assess purity and to determine if they contain the amount of ingredient claimed on the container label. How can they determine whether the amount in the container matches amount listed on the label if there is no amount listed on the label? And if they test Dream Water and measure the amounts of the 3 components, wouldn’t that reveal the proprietary secret?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder about the folks who are selling Dream Water. If they had an infection, would they be willing to take a new pharmaceutical product that was not FDA approved, that was an untested mixture of 3 prescription antibiotics, two of which had not been proven effective for that infection? Would they buy it if the dosage of the ingredients was kept secret, and would they be willing to trust the word of some unidentified person in the pharmaceutical company that it was an optimal mixture (someone who was claiming to somehow know it was optimal without bothering to test it)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For crying out loud, even my food labels specify how many grams of fat are in a serving!&lt;/p&gt;

The truth is, that I’m slammin’ busy at work these days (a very good problem to have). I’ll simply have to settle for pointing interested readers to some fresh reading - a couple of posts up from Sullivan, and one from yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;

Jenny McCarthy has complained on more than one occasion that no health authority seems to want to know how she “cured” her son. That looks to be a thing of the past now.

&lt;em&gt;Foraminifera, little sea critters whose fossilized skeletons are often used to define geologic ages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What do the words Burdigalian, Zanclean, and Maastrichtian have in common?&lt;br&gt;
A: They’re all Ages of geologic time! So are the Tithonian, Albian, Sinemurian, Norian, and dozens of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never heard of the Burdigalian? Don’t worry, I had never heard of it either before I did a little research for this skepchick post. I have only memorized the geologic timescale through the Epochs, and then only for the Cenozoic (65 million years ago to present). &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burdigalian is defined as the geologic Age which spans from 20.43 ± 0.05 million years ago to 15.97 ± 0.05 million years ago. You might be thinking to yourself that this is a strange bracket for geologic time. Why not just make it an even 20-15 million years ago? If you look closely at &lt;a href="http://www.geosociety.org/science/timescale/"&gt;the geologic timescale&lt;/a&gt;  you’ll notice that the geologic Ages (as well as the Eons, Eras, Periods, and Epochs… but we’ll get to that in a minute) are all different lengths of time that seem random. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geologic Ages do span inconsistent lengths of absolute time. This is because Ages such as the Burdigalian (which was first used in the geologic literature in 1892) were defined long before absolute dating of rocks became possible after the discovery of radioactivity in the late 1800s and the development of radioactive dating of rocks and minerals in the early to mid 1900s. We’ve only been able to confidently determine absolute ages for rocks since the 1960s or so, and every year our techniques for dating rocks become better with smaller error bars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, geologists defined the entire geologic timescale (although &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy"&gt;standardizing this timescale internationally&lt;/a&gt; is still an ongoing process) prior to the development of absolute dating of rocks and minerals. Although the absolute ages were unknown, geologists were able to work out the time periods based on the evolution of the fossil record. The main divisions of time are based on time periods when certain types of ancient organisms lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boundaries between different periods of geologic time often mark periods of mass extinctions where there was a sudden, dramatic change in the fossil record. The most famous example of this is the boundary between the Tertiary and the Cretaceous, also known as the K-T boundary. This boundary ~65 million years ago is marked by a mass extinction event famously known to have wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs. The boundary is known at the K-T boundary because “K” is used for Cretaceous and “T” is used for Tertiary on geologic maps and other places where shorthand is appropriate. Geologists have known for generations about boundaries such as K-T and about ages such as the difficult-to-say Burdigalian, but it has only been in the second half of the 1900s that they were able to start assigning absolute ages to these geologic times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned above that I had never really heard of the Burdigalian before. That’s true– I have never bothered to memorize the geologic Ages, one of the smallest divisions of geologic time, and the smallest one recognized by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_on_Stratigraphy"&gt;International Commission on Stratigraphy or ICS&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t think I will ever bother to memorize them as I can easily look them up and, honestly, I think it’s a bit silly to subdivide geologic time into such small sections. Whenever I read papers that bother with naming various Ages, I just keep a copy of the geologic timescale nearby. I have taken the time to memorize the larger divisions of geologic time, which are (from largest to smallest): Eons, Eras, Periods, and Epochs. And, as I mentioned previously, I’ve only memorized the Cenozoic Epochs because they’re the only Epochs with names. Otherwise, it’s just “early,” “middle,” and “late,” and I find these very difficult to memorize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that I originally memorized the Periods and so on was through use of mnemonics. My favorite mnemonic for the geologic Periods is &lt;strong&gt;Cold Oysters Seldom Develop Many Precious Pearls, Their Juices Congeal Too Quickly&lt;/strong&gt; which helps me remember: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, Quaternary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Cenozoic Epochs, I like the mnemonic &lt;strong&gt;Pigeon Egg Omelets Make People Puke Hourly&lt;/strong&gt; which helps me remember Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Pliocene, Pleistocene, Holocene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps what I need to remember the Ages is an appropriate (and very long!) mnemonic. I propose a challenge to the skepchick readers: come up with a mnemonic for the geologic Ages. The Ages are: CALABRIAN, GELASIAN, PIACENZIAN, ZANCLEAN, MESSINIAN, TORTONIAN, SERRAVALLIAN, LANGHIAN, BURDIGALIAN, AQUITANIAN, CHATTIAN, RUPELIAN, PRIABONIAN, BARTONIAN, LUTETIAN, YPRESIAN, THANETIAN, SELANDIAN, DANIAN, MAASTRICHTIAN, CAMPANIAN, SANTONIAN, CONIACIAN, TURONIAN, CENOMANIAN, ALBIAN, APTIAN, BARREMIAN, HAUTERIVIAN, VALANGINIAN, BERRIASIAN, TITHONIAN, KIMMERIDGIAN, OXFORDIAN, CALLOVIAN, BATHONIAN, BAJOCIAN, AALENIAN, TOARCIAN, PLIENSBACHIAN, SINEMURIAN, HETTANGIAN, RHAETIAN, NORIAN, CARNIAN, LADINIAN, ANISIAN, OLENEKIAN, INDUAN, CHANGHSINGIAN, WUCHIAPINGIAN, CAPITANIAN, WORDIAN, ROADIAN, KUNGURIAN, ARTINSKIAN, SAKMARIAN, ASSELIAN, GZELIAN, KASIMOVIAN, MOSCOVIAN, BASHKIRIAN, SERPUKHOVIAN, VISEAN, TOURNAISIAN, FAMENNIAN, FRASNIAN, GIVETIAN, EIFELIAN, EMSIAN, PRAGHIAN, LOCKHOVIAN, PRIDOLIAN, LUDFORDIAN, GORSTIAN, HOMERIAN, SHEINWOODIAN, TELYCHIAN, AERONIAN, RHUDDANIAN, HIRNANTIAN, KATIAN, SANDBIAN, DARRIWILIAN, DAPINGIAN, FLOIAN, TREMADOCIAN, STAGE 10, STAGE 9, PAIBIAN, GUZHANGIAN, DRUMIAN, STAGE 5, STAGE 4, STAGE 3, STAGE 2, FORTUNIAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! I hope I didn’t miss any of the ages. I apologize that they are all written in capital letters. I’m not yelling at you. I just copied and pasted the names from a geologic timescale, and I’m too lazy to change them out of all capital letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, see if you can come up with a long-winded mneumonic. You know, something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campbell gave pretty, zany, messy, terribly sexy, lovable, bright, amazing, cheerful Rachel praises by letters youthfully, tentatively sent. Did Mister Campbell say convincing truths carefully ascertained about beautiful, hauntingly vividly beautiful, tantalizing, kiss-invoking, outstanding, creative, breathtaking, blushing, all-knowing, terrific, pleasing, scintillating, hot Rachel? No. Courage leaves an overwhelmed, inconsolable Campbell. Why?! Campbell wondered. Rachel knows a summer affair grows kinda muted because summer  visions tear, famously fragmenting ephemeral, end-bound, primitive love. Perhaps lust graces hot summer times, announces Rachel. However, keep summer dreams dampered, flowing temporally, staying 10, staying 9, painfully gone days, staying 5, staying 4, staying 3, staying 2, forgotten. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please &lt;/em&gt; improve upon my rather “film noir”, adjective-filled, and, admittedly, very terrible mneumonic. Though, on second thought, I don’t think this (or any) epic mnemonic is going to be that helpful in memorizing geologic Ages. On third thought, memorizing the geologic Ages is stupid.  The only reason I can fathom for memorizing the Ages is to impress geology friends at a bar. Maybe I’ll work on it sometime, but honestly I think it’s only marginally more useful than &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/12/pi.day.math/index.html?iref=allsearch"&gt;memorizing digits of pi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269321389409"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/VirologyBlog/~3/lQq3s4EX4tg/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc8a2a2ca1e6cf16</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Porcine circovirus DNA in rotavirus vaccine</title><published>2010-03-22T23:04:33Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T23:04:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/GtZiBKKeMR0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/VirologyBlog/~3/lQq3s4EX4tg/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The US Food and Drug Administration has recommended that administration of the Rotarix vaccine, which protects against rotavirus infection, be suspended.

– the problem, according to Donohue, is that people are &lt;em&gt;criticizing the church&lt;/em&gt; for the abuse.  Seriously.  Find it hard to believe that anyone could make such a case with a straight face?  Read his article, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/19/donohue.catholic.church/index.html?hpt=C1"&gt;Criticism of Catholic Church is unfair&lt;/a&gt; (oh, boo hoo), which starts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rash of stories about priestly sexual abuse in Europe, especially in Ireland and Germany, has put many Catholics on the defensive. They should not be. While sexual molestation of any kind is always indefensible, the politics surrounding this story is also indefensible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note the words “While sexual molestation of any kind is always indefensible…” – and consider that is the only indication Donohue gives in the entire 650 word article that sexual molestation of children is bad.  Go on, read the whole thing.  There is nothing else in the whole piece – nothing – that indicates that raping children is wrong, it’s all about how everyone is being mean to the Catholic church.  Incredible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donohue starts with the old false equivalence trick:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Employers from every walk of life, in both the U.S. and Europe, have long handled cases of alleged sex abuse by employees as an internal matter. Rarely have employers called the cops, and none was required to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s comparing rape of children to “alleged sex abuse by employees.”  Is he saying that companies in the US and Europe have been aware of their employees raping children as a part of their work?  Well, it’s hard to know for sure what’s in the mind of this old idiot, but somehow I don’t think even he is saying this.  What he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; trying to get away with is equating workplace sexual harassment – the boss groping his secretary, say – with raping children.  And while it is certainly true that, say 30 or 40 years ago, sexist bosses could get away with things they would likely be sued and/or fired for now (watch &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;), this is nothing like what the church is accused of covering up.  Not even close.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyone who maintains that in North America or Europe it was common practice for employers outside the &lt;a href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/Roman_Catholicism"&gt;Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt; to file a police report about suspected wrongdoing by their employees needs to put up or shut up: Where is the evidence?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one is saying that employers had to file a police report about any suspected wrongdoing by their employees.  That would be ridiculous.  I think most people would suggest that if an employer knew one of his employees had committed rape of a child while doing his job, then the employer should certainly report it.  And most probably would.  And the duty to report would be even greater if the employee’s job was to supervise the child that he had raped.  A job such as, for example, a schoolteacher, scout leader or a bleeding Roman Catholic priest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond that issue, the focus on &lt;a href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/Sexual_Offenses"&gt;sexual abuse&lt;/a&gt; in the Catholic Church is far out of proportion to the attention given by the media to the sexual molestation of minors when committed by non-Catholic clergymen. According to a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/nyregion/14abuse.html?_r=1&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;sq=vitello%20orthodox&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the New York Times in October, the Brooklyn district attorney&amp;#39;s office had filed charges in 26 cases of sexual abuse involving members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donohue just has to bring the Jews into it.  Hey, some Jews in Brooklyn abused children, so we can too.  Sorry, not an excuse.  If a Jewish religious community has been abusing children then that is just as bad, and the guilty people should be jailed.  If that didn&amp;#39;t receive as much publicity as the Catholic church’s abuses, it’s because the Catholic church has a wider congregation, and the abuse affected many more children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason the church is rightly getting all the criticism is that they claim to be god’s representatives on Earth, and they routinely preach their morality to the rest of us, including those of us who don’t believe their particular fairly story.  They demand obedience from their followers.  They (the priests)&lt;em&gt; as part of their jobs&lt;/em&gt; are in positions of authority over small children.  They should be above reproach, but they have been shown to be unworthy of the trust placed upon them.  Most Catholics know this.  Even the pope seems to recognize it (belatedly).  But Donohue, while paying lip service to the “indefensible” nature of such abuse, thinks that the real problem here is with &lt;em&gt;people criticizing the church&lt;/em&gt; for the abuse.  He actually says that this criticism – just the criticism mind you – is “immoral.”  If anything is immoral it is Donohue and this vile article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269316756660"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=1206">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/155465a89c29ed7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="apostasy"/><category term="canadia"/><category term="clerics"/><category term="dungeons and dragons"/><category term="freedom of speech"/><category term="freedom to mock"/><category term="halibut"/><category term="hate speech"/><category term="health care"/><category term="islam"/><category term="passover"/><category term="whole foods"/><category term="yemen"/><title type="html">Yemen’s Next Top Cleric</title><published>2010-03-23T03:14:15Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T03:14:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org/2010/03/22/yemens-next-top-cleric/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://yrif.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow.  I’ve been super-busy lobbying my congresspersons to send free $250 checks to old people, and they’ve &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_health_care_overhaul"&gt;finally come through&lt;/a&gt;, which means I can start again following news that isn’t about giving free checks to old people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in time, it turns out, because it looks like there’s a lot going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the winners of the last several seasons of “&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100322/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_yemen_child_brides_2"&gt;Yemen’s Next Top Cleric&lt;/a&gt;” have taken a break from their lucrative modeling contracts to call apostasy on anyone who supports a ban on child brides.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be clear, I don’t think all of Yemen’s Top Clerics actually got their positions via reality TV.  I’m sure some of them also won &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleric_%28Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons%29"&gt;Dungeons and Dragons tournaments&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush it sounds a little extreme to advocate that your political opponents be &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam#Punishment_for_apostasy"&gt;beheaded&lt;/a&gt;, but (as I’ve learned while carefully following the free-checks-for-old-people debate) public discourse all seems headed in that direction anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it’s almost time for Passover, when we pretend that &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2010/0111/Egypt-says-Jewish-slaves-didn-t-build-pyramids"&gt;Jews built the pyramids&lt;/a&gt; and try to &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-food-desert22-2010mar22,0,6551341.story?track=rss"&gt;force supermarkets to locate in bad neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groups are pressing Reyes to include not only carrots but also sticks in his proposed ordinance, urging him to use the city’s permitting powers to challenge grocers who locate in well-heeled neighborhoods but not poor ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we should probably exclude &lt;a href="http://wholeboycott.com/about/"&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/a&gt;, as their CEO abused his position as CEO to write an op-ed piece advocating against free checks for old people.  Although I did just buy there some really nice fresh-caught wild halibut, $16.99/pound, that I bet people in poor neighborhoods would really enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a number of you have asked why my book is &lt;a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/search?keywords=your%20religion%20is%20false&amp;amp;pageSize=10"&gt;not available in Canadia&lt;/a&gt;.  The answer, sadly, is that in Canadia there are also penalties for &lt;a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2710037"&gt;offending the Top Clerics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will realize that Canadian law puts reasonable [sic] limits on the freedom of expression. For example, promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate, but could in fact lead to criminal charges. Outside of the criminal realm, Canadian defamation laws also limit freedom of expression and may differ somewhat from those to which you are accustomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have it on good authority that Canadia was way ahead of the curve on the “free checks for old people” issue, so perhaps it all evens out!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269313515519"><id gr:original-id="http://evol-eco.blogspot.com/2010/03/predicting-endangered-carnivores-role.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ab2ffcaea6395b4f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Predicting endangered carnivores: the role of environment, space and phylogeny</title><published>2010-03-22T21:25:11Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T21:25:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/WiIQ0jTGVcY/predicting-endangered-carnivores-role.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://evol-eco.blogspot.com/2010/03/predicting-endangered-carnivores-role.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">For conservation biology, there are several research thrusts that are of critical importance, and one of these is to find predictors of species&amp;#39; extinction risk. Oft-cited is the particular susceptibility of large-bodied organisms, with their large ranges and slow reproductive rates. But there should be other predictors too, especially within larger mammals. In a forthcoming paper in Global Ecology and Biogeography, Safi and Pettorelli use just a few variables to predict extinction risk in carnivores.They quantified species extinction risk according to the IUCN risk assessments and asked how well three attributes explained variation in extinction risk. They quantified the environmental characteristics of the species&amp;#39; ranges (temperature, precipitation, etc.), spatial distances between species&amp;#39; ranges and the phylogenetic distances among species. Overall, spatial and phylogenetic distances were good predictors of threat status -generally predicting between 21-70% of variation in extinction risk, whereas the environmental variables were weaker predictors. Full models incorporating all three variables (and accounting for their covariance), were able to explain upwards of 96% of the variation in extinction risk!Although these variables do not represent causal mechanisms of extinction risk -rather they are correlative, they do provide conservation biologists with a rapid assessment tool to evaluate extinction risk. These tools should be particularly important in cases were population data are lacking and immediate pragmatic decisions are required.Safi, K., &amp;amp; Pettorelli, N. (2010).

The societal and economic changes wrought across the 17th century in England, for example, show us that increased longevity leads to increased wealth, through more foresighted allocation of capital resources and the compounded effect of small gains, year after year. The converse is also true: increased wealth leads to increased longevity, a fact well illustrated by the passage of many Asian countries from undeveloped to developed in a short span of decades. Let us take the economic history of South Korea, for example: South Korea is a developed country and had one of the world's fastest growing economies from the early 1960s to the late 1990s. Its rapid transformation into a wealthy and industrialized economy in this short time was termed the Miracle on the Han River. This growth surge was achieved through manufacturing oriented exports and a highly educated workforce. As of 2009, South Korea is the world's eighth largest exporter. Across this same period of time, life expectancy in South Korea rose dramatically: Objectives.

&lt;p&gt;Last Wednesday, the &lt;a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/"&gt;National Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; (known to biologists as the &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/08/30/a-day-at-the-museum/"&gt;USNM&lt;/a&gt;, the initials of its former name and still the identifying code on its specimen tags and labels) opened its newest permanent exhibit, the &lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/"&gt;Hall of Human Origins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Hall of Human Origns at USNM" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn4626-e1269263816390.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="" width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at the USNM much of last week, mostly doing research in the collections and meeting with colleagues, but I always like to take a look at the exhibits, and I’d in part planned my visit to be able to catch the opening on the last day of my visit. Unfortunately, it turns out the exhibit was only open from 12-3, the rest of the day being reserved for media and VIPs, so when I went to see it a bit after 3 all I could see was one skull through a crack in a barrier. I’m planning another go at it this summer, but some of the original specimens, loaned by foreign museums for the opening, are likely to have been replaced by casts by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Rothstein, the New York Times’ museum reviewer, whose reviews I always find interesting, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/19/arts/design/19museum.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=koch%20rothstein&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;did get to see it&lt;/a&gt;.  He gives it a mixed review. A hall worth “repeated, close viewing” suggests an exhibit rich in the diversity and number of its specimens, a characteristic of the “cabinet” style in museum exhibits, but he laments the poor execution of the computers and touch screens of the “interactive” style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hall bears repeated, close viewing, though children will also find amusements here, including the opportunity to come face to face with floor-level bronze models of their ancestors. But the two computer simulations at the exhibition’s end — one a simplified Sims-type game of cultural and environmental choice, the other a cartoonish vision of possible future evolutionary change — should be far more subtle. More wall text summarizing themes would have also helped: too much is left to the text of touch screens, buried inside menus of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also raises an issue that &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/new-human-evolution-exhibit-to-open-at-the-usnm/"&gt;concerned me&lt;/a&gt; when the opening was announced last fall: that the exhibit might adopt some theological viewpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are times too when it seems as if the Smithsonian has almost gone too far in humanizing evolution, as if it were answering those who, on religious grounds, object to the evolutionary universe and its inhuman brutality. (A touch-screen F.A.Q. suggests simply that such visitors use the show to “explore new scientific findings and decide how these findings complement their ideas about the natural world.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the exhibition’s focus doesn’t really give us a feel for the daring of the evolutionary vision, which is a tale not of progress but of accident, frightening in the moment, fortuitous only in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the exhibit website, I found the page for the &lt;a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/about/bsic"&gt;Broader Social Impacts Committee&lt;/a&gt;. The committee consists of 14 people, all but one of whom are identified by their religion (including one “Humanist”). This is a rather odd composition and set of descriptors for a group concerned with broader social impacts– no historians, sociologists, political scientists. But as the website makes clear, the charge of the committee is to deal with religious issues. The following statement from the website, while straightforward in acknowledging the diversity of views, seems to prefer the last view (“interaction or engagement”), but its not clear to me what exactly this view entails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different approaches to the science-religion relationship. One approach is to see science and religion as separate domains that ask different questions focusing on separate interests in human life – for example, about the natural world in science and about God in religion. This approach depends on respecting and maintaining the distinctions but can sometimes overlook the ways in which scientific interpretations may have an effect on religious beliefs. Conflict is seen to arise when efforts are made to eliminate the separation that the first approach assumes. The strongest conflicts develop when either science or religion asserts a standard of truth to which the other must adhere or otherwise be dismissed. An alternative approach sees interaction or engagement as positive. Engagement takes many forms, including personal efforts by individuals to integrate scientific and religious understandings, statements by religious organizations that affirm and even celebrate the scientific findings, and constructive interactions between theologians and scientists seeking common ground, respect, and shared insight into how the science of human evolution contributes to an awareness of what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My full opinion will have to wait till I get to see the exhibit myself. One thing I’m looking forward to are the new reconstructions.  John Gurche, the renowned scientific artist, has made a set of incredibly detailed life reconstructions for the exhibit (&lt;a href="http://www.gurche.com/main_frameset.htm"&gt;seen here&lt;/a&gt;; check out the rest of his website for more paintings and sculptures), and &lt;a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html"&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/a&gt; has had two &lt;a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Sculpting-Evolution.html#"&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Rothstein’s final word:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the retrospective vistas provided here are, nevertheless, compelling and illuminating. This was conceived as a permanent exhibition, meant to serve a generation of visitors, but it was also designed to be easily adaptable to the pressures of scientific advances and visitor tastes. The evolution continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(PS: On the way in to the museum that morning, Greenpeace protesters, dressed like law enforcement agents from the “Climate Crimes” unit, handed me a &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2010/03/17/koch-hall-human-origins/"&gt;flyer &lt;/a&gt;denouncing David Koch, who contributed most of the funding for the hall (and whose name is on it).

And be serious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 2.&lt;/strong&gt; Richard Dawkins has a brief commentary on this incident &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/articles/5304"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He mentions someone I’d forgotten about: Simon Conway “Humans-are-Inevitable” Morris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its continuing drive to buy itself scientific respectability, the Templeton Foundation is going to announce the annual winner of its 1.5-million-dollar Templeton prize this Thursday. And guess where?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You guessed it: at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C.!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the National Academy has apparently rented the Foundation their hall so that, amidst the trappings of America’s most distinguished body of scientists, The Templeton Foundation can fete the person who most successfully conflated Science and Woo in the last few years.  The invitation is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an outrage, of course, and shame on the National Academy for its implicit endorsement of religion.  If they say, “Well, we rent our space to &lt;em&gt;anybody&lt;/em&gt;,” then I look forward to seeing an adult film festival at the NAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing that this year’s winner, based on the location, will be &lt;strong&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/strong&gt;.  Dear readers, do post your guess, and we’ll see how close we get.  Runners-up may be Kenneth Miller, Karen Armstrong, John Haught, and Robert Wright.  But choose your favorite! One choice per person. And remember, according to the Foundation’s guidelines, “IF YOU GUESS THE WINNER, YOU CAN’T TELL ANYONE!” (What the hell does &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; mean?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_______________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templeton Prize Invitation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Templeton Prize (www.templetonprize.org) was established in 1972 by Sir John Templeton. The Prize has been awarded to physicists, biologists, theologians, ministers, philanthropists, writers, and reformers for work that has ranged from the creation of new religious orders and social movements to humanistic scholarship and research about the origins of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your kind reply,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John M. Templeton Jr., M.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President and Chairman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Templeton Foundation&lt;/p&gt;

During these times when I did not post, when you only see your own typing and not mine, it was then that I carried you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/lilienfeld_headshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="lilienfeld_headshot" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/lilienfeld_headshot.jpg?w=149&amp;amp;h=165" alt="" width="149" height="165"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My latest &lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/scott_lilienfeld_real_self-help/"&gt;Point of Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; interview features &lt;strong&gt;Dr Scott Lilienfeld&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott is Professor of Psychology at Emory University, Atlanta, and an author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1405131128?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=poinofinqu-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1405131128"&gt;&lt;em&gt;50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread  Misconceptions About Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-written with Steven Jay  Lynn,  John Ruscio and the late great Barry Beyerstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Busting over 300 myths and misconceptions, this book is the Mythbusters of Psychology. It’s a smashing read, revealing that polygraph tests aren’t lie detectors, that men aren’t from Mars and women aren’t from Venus, and that the g-spot probably doesn’t exist (but I could have told you that…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott and I discuss psychology vs. pop psychology, intuition, communicating science to the public, how to evaluate claims and information as presented to us, and how bust the myths and sink those “unsinkable ducks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scott admits that human experience makes us all armchair psychologists,  and we are all susceptible to Dr. Phil-psychology and self-help books.  But self-help is more often hindrance than help. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backed up by science,  this book is the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; self-help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott is also my boss on the academic journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.srmhp.org/current-issue.html"&gt;Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and a smashing guy who’s great fun over dinner and a glass of red wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your set of skeptical steak knives is the &lt;strong&gt;Bad Cast&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://badpsychics.co.uk/thefraudfiles/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1200"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Psychics Podcast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode Three covers ghost hunting, spirit channeling, and alternative medicine, and includes a segment where I recount my experiences at a Metaphysical Fair I attended recently where I had a reading with a psychometrist who’s about as psychic as the fingernail I just clipped off but don’t go using it in voodoo rituals…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you act now, you can still nab tickets to &lt;a href="http://www.skepticalcon.org/cms/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SkeptiCal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Northern California Science and Skepticism Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Dunning will be speaking, and to make up for that Genie Scott, Seth Shostak, Brian Malow and I will be speaking too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be lectures, breakout sessions and exhibits tackling a range of paranormal and pseudoscientific themes, such as creationism, psychics, alternative medicine, skepticism and the media, and the climate change debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4198"&gt;Is there a role for speculative journals like &lt;em&gt;Medical Hypotheses &lt;/em&gt;in the scientific literature?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(David Gorski) &lt;em&gt;Medical Hypotheses &lt;/em&gt;is a non-peer-reviewed journal that publishes “radical, speculative and non-mainstream scientific ideas,” some of which are demonstrably wrong; yet its articles are cited as scientific evidence by racists, AIDS denialists, and anti-vaccine activists. Speculation may serve a purpose, but it should be clearly labeled as such and not published in such a way that it could easily be confused with legitimate scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4204"&gt;Diagnosis, Therapy and Evidence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Harriet Hall) A review of a new book with this title, explaining that “many claims about the causes of disease, therapeutic practices, and even diagnoses are shaped by beliefs that are unscientific, unproven, or completely wrong.” Artificially constructed categories and early hypotheses can mislead us: scientists should constantly reassess whether any other explanations might fit the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4209"&gt;How bad can health reporting get?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Peter Lipson) A surgeon turned faith healer/acupuncturist/shaman was featured in a TV news report that was totally credulous and amounted to an infomercial for his practice. A responsible reporter would have questioned the doctor’s claims and addressed the chicanery of faith healers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4200"&gt;Mainstream Media’s Sub-Par Health Coverage, Part 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Val Jones) A followup on an interview that was misrepresented in the final article due to interference by editors and a misguided quest for “balance.”  Journalists often do not have the depth of experience to handle complicated health topics and do not represent important scientific nuances correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4248"&gt;The Evolving Science and Guidelines of CPR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Joseph Albietz)  New guidelines for CPR recommend only chest compressions (without rescue breathing) for adults, but the guidelines don’t apply to children because they are more likely to have respiratory arrests than cardiac arrests. CPR isn’t the lifesaving miracle depicted in the media: it restores heartbeat temporarily but if the underlying cause isn’t addressed, the heart will promptly stop again. &lt;/p&gt;

And then I see an &amp;#39;argument&amp;#39; like the one in this argument defending keeping &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; on our money, and I realize that…YES, I DO CARE. I care very much that people are so deeply infected with religion that they actually think this is a clever defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; is not comparable to an organization, a building, a philosophy or a religion. God, unlike an establishment of religion, is a concept to atheists and believers alike. The believer perceives God as the living creator of all. The atheist perceives God as an unfortunate fictional concept that causes war. Either way, this country was founded on respect for a higher power than man — an entity generically referred to as God in the English-speaking world. The laws of our land protect our right to revere or disavow God, but they do not protect us from hearing and seeing the term. Believer and non-believer alike make up one nation under God, because the first law of the land protects belief or disbelief in God, the right to talk about God, and the right to make God the highest authority in one&amp;#39;s life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because we&amp;#39;re a nation under God — with God as a concept we are free to love as truth or disavow as fiction — we have never been one nation under Washington, Lincoln, Reagan or Obama. We are a nation that elevates God — whatever God means — above any human authority because we are a nation that elevates an individual&amp;#39;s choices above the agendas of authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get that? Believers like God, atheists think god is an "unfortunate fictional concept", but either way, we have respect for a higher power. And because we are free to disbelieve in God, it is symbolic of our &lt;i&gt;freedom&lt;/i&gt; to honor God. His god. That Abrahamic tyrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they're all interchangeable and we just need to honor a generic concept, then why not have alternating mintings where "God" is interchanged with "Allah" and "Cthulhu" and "Satan" and "Mammon" and whatever? It shouldn't bother this author. After all, he suggests we just use our imaginations to insert whatever meaning we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; When annoyed by currency, atheists have the option of interpreting "in God we trust" as "in a fictional concept we trust" for the sake of limited government.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't care what you think of the issue, but you should vote for reason and against sloppy supernaturalist lunacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gazette.com/opinion/stop-95654-claus-view.html"&gt;Should "God" be stricken from U.S. currency and the Pledge of Allegiance?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, lose the references to God
43%&lt;br&gt;
No, keep God on currency and in the Pledge
53%&lt;br&gt;
I don't know
0%&lt;br&gt;
I don't care
4%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it helps, you can try interpreting "Should 'God' be stricken from U.S. currency and the Pledge of Allegiance?" as "Should gibbering lunatics like Wayne Laugesen be stricken from the editorial pages of the Colorado Springs Gazette?" For the sake of liberty, freedom, and justice for all. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, duh.  People who actually claim that this bill should not become law because it is flawed come in two flavors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Those who are simply against all health care reform and are just blowing this out of one orifice or another.  Birthers, teabaggers, Republicans, heatlh care lobbyists, other undesirables.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) People who have little knowledge of how these things work and just woke up to find that reality is not what they assumed, in their ignorance it to be.  Have you ever heard of the EPA and environmental regulation? The "Great Society" and legal protections for disadvantaged groups?  The New Deal and banking regulation?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three of those major shifts if the interrelationship between society and government, all of which progressives look back on and can justifiably claim to be good things, started out as sucky law.  This is how it is done. You propose some good law, the yahoos show up and delay, damage, mess with the process until you finally have something that can't pass.  Then you give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you come back and do it again.  And again. And again.  And finally, you get the law passed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you have this law that is not what you wanted, but you DO have a bill.  You are now, finally, at the table.  The basic idea of having laws of some kind dealing with a basic issue ... racial discrimination, environmental protection, banking regulation, or people- and health-oriented health care insurance regulation ... is then a reality, and further negotiations must start from that point, in stead of the perspective that the notion of reform is alien.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look a those early versions for these other,  earlier efforts they were  much less developed and probably much less effective than the current health care bill is.  And to  demonstrate that, I give you the recently posted list of ten good things about this bill from Moveon.org: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/moveonorgs_10_things_every_ame.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/moveonorgs_10_things_every_ame.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/ddUYLcscHIQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269307343741"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-488262047686109051.post-8114067858312183660">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/241738d3725983d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">**BREAKING NEWS - JUSTICE SECRETARY STRAW TO COMMIT TO LIBEL REFORM AT MASS PARLIAMENTARY LOBBY**</title><published>2010-03-22T21:59:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T21:59:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/breaking-news-justice-secretary-straw.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>teekblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269306428643"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dormivigilia.com/?p=1491">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aec7413fd82f0a20</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Cardiac Output Regulation Within the SCN</title><published>2010-03-22T20:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T20:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/L7OUSsrjevI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.dormivigilia.com/?p=1491"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Circadian researchers have preliminary evidence suggesting that normal circadian clock functioning is necessary for cardiac output regulation.

With two of the three  major political parties now committed to reform, we ask David Cameron to back  our campaign.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Tracey Brown, the Managing Director of Sense  About Science said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;It would be ludicrous for any party to  suggest we should continue with these unfair and ridiculed libel laws. We need  freedom of speech that we can exercise confidently, to discuss science and medicine  or any other subject of public interest. Not semi-feudal laws that tie people  up in court for two years and chill public discussion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Jonathan Heawood, the Director of English  PEN said,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Over 40,000 people have signed the libel  reform petition. The level of popular support for reform shows that this law is  not just about journalists but human rights activists, scientists and  academics, even mothers chatting online: free expression really is an issue for  everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:georgia"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium"&gt;Such a positive endorsement of the need for reform must be welcomed, and it now falls on the Campaign for Libel Reform and the thousands of people who have supported it to maintain the momentum gathered thus far, to ensure that this committment is translated into concrete and workable legislative reform. Let's hope that today sees the turning point in the battle to protect responsible journalism and scientific discourse from the chilling effects of English libel law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/488262047686109051-8114067858312183660?l=teekblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269300808447"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/understanding_scientific_terms.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b35b236607474bfa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Understanding Scientific Terms About Climate Change</title><published>2010-03-23T00:17:09Z</published><updated>2010-03-23T00:17:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/XzyoxWHPAGU/understanding_scientific_terms.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/understanding_scientific_terms.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;An item from the Union of Concerned Scientists: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/understanding_scientific_terms.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/understanding_scientific_terms.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/XzyoxWHPAGU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269300753177"><id gr:original-id="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=906">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f8e7d642d3f508d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kudos"/><title type="html">Tribune investigation takes first place</title><published>2010-03-22T22:21:19Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T22:21:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com/archives/906" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://autism-news-beat.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year-long investigation by Trine Tsouderos and Patricia Callahan into questionable autism treatments has earned the Chicago Tribune a first place in the &lt;a href="http://www.healthjournalism.org/about-news-detail.php?id=86"&gt;Awards for Excellence in Health Care Journalism&lt;/a&gt;. The series was kicked off in March, 2009, with “Dubious Medicine”, which you can read &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-autism-storygallery,0,6581479.storygallery"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; It exposed the father-son team of Mark and David Geier, who use chemical castration drugs to “treat” disabled children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This powerful series combines first rate medical writing and rigorous investigative reporting to expose doctors who perform what the authors rightly call “uncontrolled experiments on vulnerable children” with autism,” commented the judges. “Writing with the authority that comes from total command of the material, Tsouderos and Callahan bring new clarity to a notoriously murky subject-autism treatments. They document a horrifying brand of bad science perpetrated by bad doctors on desperate families, but they do it without a hint of hyperbole or sensationalism. Their straightforward, professional tone lets the facts tell the story. The result is an important-and devastating-piece.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 awards, announced today by the Association of Health Care  Journalists, recognize the best health reporting in nine categories,  covering print, broadcast and online media. The contest, in its sixth  year, received more than 250 entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The quality of these entries – particularly the number of strong  investigative pieces – show that even in an era of diminished resources,  health care journalists are continuing their vital watchdog role,” said  Julie Appleby, contest chair and a senior correspondent at Kaiser  Health News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series, note the judges, “provided readers and parents with hard evidence and some difficult truths, concluding that thousands of children with autism are being subjected to mass uncontrolled experimentation every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Holt, Tribune standards editor, praised the series for avoiding the false balancing that derails much of what passes for reporting these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, we forget that truth is not a matter of popular vote, and sometimes, it would be disingenuous to offer a so-called “balanced” report by virtue of presenting a “he said-she said” summary,” says Holt. “This topic is far too important for that approach.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269300647420"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22452">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee85034f78873ae0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Repent Amarillo</title><published>2010-03-22T23:00:19Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T23:00:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/22/repent-amarillo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holy shit.

The amino acid sequence of a protein determines its structure, and countless studies have substantiated the idea that proteins with similar sequences will adopt similar folded conformations. Because structure and dynamics are intrinsically linked, one could reasonably assume that many features of a protein&amp;#39;s dynamics get conserved along with the fold. A growing number of experiments show that this is indeed the case, including a recent paper in Structure (1).

We already have some evidence of fold-dependent dynamics. An NMR study from my mentor Andrew Lee&amp;#39;s lab comparing fast fluctuations of side chains among three related proteins from the PDZ family suggested that motions on this timescale could be evolutionarily conserved (2). That study compared the model-free order parameters of methyl groups from one protein to those of their counterparts in other PDZ domains. Predicting an order parameter using dynamics data from a structurally equivalent residue in another protein was shown to be slightly more accurate than calculations from structural considerations such as packing or methyl type. In a similar vein, I have previously discussed studies on adenylate kinase enzymes from E. coli and a thermophilic organism that show they have similar backbone dynamics under conditions where their enzymatic activity is about equal, although they differ substantially from each other at room temperature.

Of course, these studies were limited and involved just a few proteins, because getting experimental data about dynamics is costly and time-consuming. For comparisons across large numbers of different proteins, computational approaches may therefore be of great value. Previously, other groups have made use of short molecular dynamics simulations or normal mode analysis. Raimondi et al. continue in this vein, combining normal-mode analysis of single structures with principal component analysis of a large set of structures from the Ras superfamily of proteins.

The Ras superfamily encompasses several groups of related folds with nucleotide-dependent activity. When GTP is bound to them, they are active and propagate a particular signal. Over time, the GTP gets hydrolyzed to GDP and the signal turns off. This catalytic process is pretty inefficient, but it can be enhanced by the action of a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP). The exchange of GDP for GTP can be enhanced by the action of a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF). The GTP/GDP state manifests primarily in the positioning of two loops, termed the switch regions (SwI and SwII). This mechanism allows for several different modes of control, so the Ras architecture has been repurposed many times throughout evolution for a variety of different roles.

Because the different members of the superfamily play key roles in their respective pathways, there are many structures available, often in several different states (GTP-bound, GDP-bound, GEF-bound, etc.). Raimondi et al. aligned these structures using the common features of the Ras fold and used PCA to identify flexibility across this evolutionary ensemble. The goal of PCA is to take a dataset with many potentially correlated data points (in this case, the relative positions of the backbone Cα atoms) and identify a small set of variables that explain as much of the variance as possible. Here, the principal components (PC) are expected to describe the structural variability of the fold.

The first PC, which is expected to explain the largest amount of the variability, can separate the structures by their families. That is, the displacement along PC1 can distinguish a Rho family domain from an Arf family domain. The authors call this variability function-independent, because this principal component doesn&amp;#39;t seem to make any meaningful distinction between the GTP/active and GDP/inactive states. That appears to be a property of the second PC, which for some families does a very good job of separating the GTP from the GDP-bound forms (for others there appears to be more mixing). According to this analysis, function-dependent variability appears to be confined to one half of the protein, while function-independent variability seems to be distributed across the whole fold.

The authors also performed normal mode analysis on individual proteins from the Ras superfamily using an elastic network model. In this kind of simulation the protein is modeled as a group of Cα &amp;quot;nodes&amp;quot; connected by spring-like harmonic potentials representing covalent and non-covalent interactions. Although any one of these &amp;quot;bonds&amp;quot; can be stretched, compressed, and moved, such deformations exert a force on other bonds connected to the nodes involved, which tends to damp most motions. Certain collective deformations will be favored as a result, and these can be calculated as &amp;quot;normal modes&amp;quot; that probably reflect slow fluctuations of the fold.

The deformations detected by ENM for all individual proteins overlapped significantly with the second PC identified in the evolutionary analysis. That is, the conformational variability of a conserved domain over evolutionary time is correlated with the conformational fluctuations of a single domain on a biological time scale. This makes sense, especially in this case, because the switch regions are areas of significant conformational variability, and are connected with the conserved catalytic function of these proteins. The fact that PC1 doesn&amp;#39;t line up with the low-frequency normal modes probably means that the conformational transitions between different family members cannot be mimicked by ordinary thermal motion, i.e. the fold cannot change this way without the aid of mutations.

Although the results in these studies might seem rather pedestrian and expected, I find them quite encouraging. We&amp;#39;re not particularly good at predicting structure from sequence yet, and our understanding of protein dynamics is even more primitive. What these studies indicate is that it should be possible to predict the conformational fluctuations of a given protein or domain using our knowledge of a related, homologous protein. This could have positive consequences for fields such as rational drug design and protein design, which have met with limited success in part, perhaps, because they do not sufficiently account for a protein&amp;#39;s structural fluctuations.

Such finds are extremely rare, because nervous tissue is soft and normally begins to decompose soon after death, so this specimen is unique in that it has been far better preserved than any other. Although reduced by about 80% of its original weight, many of its anatomical features have remained intact. The frontal, temporal and occipital lobes have retained their original shape; the gyri and sulci (the grooves and furrows on the surface, respectively labelled G and S, above) are easily recognizable; and amazingly, it contains the identifiable remnants of neurons.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Last night was the climax of weeks and months of debate on a health care bill that my constituents fear and do not support.  In the heat and emotion of the debate, I exclaimed the phrase 'it's a baby killer' in reference to the agreement reached by the Democratic leadership.  While I remain heartbroken over the passage of this bill and the tragic consequences it will have for the unborn, I deeply regret that my actions were mistakenly interpreted as a direct reference to Congressman Stupak himself.

&lt;p&gt;"I have apologized to Mr. Stupak and also...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh shut up, asshole.  The only honorable action you can take at this time is to resign.  But you will not do that. You will not even learn to behave like a civilized human being.  Your statement was forced on you by your party's leadership.  You should be ashamed of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

Welcome back to The Greatest Story Ever Told, where we're bringing you the story of the Universe.  We're going to go from the &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; beginning -- before the big bang -- up through the present day, and tell you how we got here.  This is part seven, and you can always go back for parts &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-.php"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/01/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_1.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/02/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_2.php"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/02/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_3.php"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_4.php"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_5.php"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_5.php"&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt;, we got rid of all the antimatter in the Universe by letting it cool enough that every particle-antiparticle pair in the Universe annihilated with one another, producing a huge excess of radiation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/annih.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/annih-thumb-500x526-43165.gif" width="500" height="526" alt="annih.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was also a little bit of normal matter -- protons, neutrons, and electrons -- that got left over.  When we ask "how much", we found that for every &lt;b&gt;ten billion&lt;/b&gt; photons (particles of light), we have only &lt;b&gt;six&lt;/b&gt; protons and neutrons left over, with exactly as many electrons as there are protons to keep the Universe electrically neutral. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Universe is also still very hot and dense, although it &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; been expanding and cooling.  When we ended the last part, the Universe was around one second old, which means the temperature was &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; about a thousand times as hot as the center of the Sun.  (And that's right; it took the first &lt;i&gt;six&lt;/i&gt; parts of this story just to cover the first second!)  So what do you think these protons and neutrons are going to do at these high temperatures and high densities?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/fusion-sun.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/fusion-sun-thumb-500x286-43167.gif" width="500" height="286" alt="fusion-sun.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you guess "fuse to form heavier elements" like they do in the center of the Sun?  It's a good guess.  After all, you certainly have enough protons and neutrons, enough energy, and a high enough density to make heavier elements.  But there's a problem.  For every six nucleons (protons and neutrons) that you have, you have &lt;b&gt;ten billion photons&lt;/b&gt;.  So even though you can fuse a proton and a neutron into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium"&gt;deuterium&lt;/a&gt; -- the first step in our staircase towards the heavier elements -- a whole slew of photons will run into your newly formed deuterium before anything else can happen, effectively blasting it apart immediately.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Protons_Neutrons.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/Protons_Neutrons-thumb-500x360-43170.jpg" width="500" height="360" alt="Protons_Neutrons.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to make anything that lasts, we need the Universe to cool down so that these photons won't have enough energy to blast our nuclei apart.  The protons will be fine; they're patient, and they live forever, so they can wait for the Universe to cool.  But the neutrons?  They're not so patient.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/radioactive-atom.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/radioactive-atom-thumb-500x309-43172.gif" width="500" height="309" alt="radioactive-atom.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've all heard of radioactive decay before.  Sometimes, you get a collection of protons and neutrons together in a way that's unstable, and they radiate some energy away, becoming a different atomic nucleus in the process.  Believe it or not, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron#Stability_and_beta_decay"&gt;free neutrons&lt;/a&gt; are radioactive, too!  If you leave a neutron on its own, after about ten minutes (its half-life), it will decay into a proton, an electron, and an anti-neutrino.  So for every second that we wait for the Universe to cool down, so that these photons will stop blasting our nuclei apart, we lose neutrons, and replace them with protons and electrons.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/NeutronDecay.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/NeutronDecay-thumb-500x413-43174.png" width="500" height="413" alt="NeutronDecay.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the neutrons have to wait too long for the Universe to cool, then they'll all decay, and our Universe will be 100% protons and electrons, with no neutrons at all.  But our Universe is an impatient place, and when it expands, it cools &lt;i&gt;fast&lt;/i&gt;.  Every time the Universe doubles in size, the temperature halves.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what's really been changing quickly?  The &lt;b&gt;density&lt;/b&gt; of the Universe.  Every time the Universe doubles in size, the &lt;i&gt;matter&lt;/i&gt; density drops by a factor of &lt;i&gt;eight&lt;/i&gt;, and the &lt;i&gt;energy&lt;/i&gt; density (because things are also cooling) drops by a factor of &lt;i&gt;sixteen&lt;/i&gt;.  So by time the Universe is a little more than three minutes old, you can form deuterium without it being blasted apart!  And once you make deuterium, everything else goes super quickly, bringing you to Helium-3, and then all the way up to Helium-4.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/he3-diagram.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/he3-diagram-thumb-500x351-43177.gif" width="500" height="351" alt="he3-diagram.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you work out the math, theoretically, you find that this story should get you a Universe that was about 76% Hydrogen and 24% Helium-4, with trace amounts of Deuterium, Helium-3, and Lithium-7 from the Big Bang.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do you do, if you're an astronomer?  You go and look for regions of space that haven't been touched by star formation since the big bang, and you try to measure how much of each element you have!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/quasar5p2_hst.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/quasar5p2_hst-thumb-500x375-43179.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="quasar5p2_hst.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the earliest &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt; we're able to perform on the Big Bang Theory: you know what elements you ought to get from the Big Bang, but what do you actually see when you go out and measure these elements?  What do you find for Hydrogen, Helium-4, Deuterium, Helium-3, and Lithium-7?  Let's have a look.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/I02-09-nucleosynthesis.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-/I02-09-nucleosynthesis-thumb-500x566-43181.jpg" width="500" height="566" alt="I02-09-nucleosynthesis.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, we measure &lt;i&gt;almost exactly&lt;/i&gt; what we predict!  This was a &lt;b&gt;huge&lt;/b&gt; confirmation of the Big Bang Theory, and is still one of the best tools we have today!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Universe manages to save the neutrons by locking them up inside of -- mostly -- Helium nuclei, which are stable!  We've been telling you a story that's been almost entirely theoretical, because we haven't been able to observe anything this early, &lt;i&gt;until now&lt;/i&gt;.  So our first chance to test whether this "Greatest Story Ever Told" matches reality or not is a &lt;i&gt;smashing&lt;/i&gt; success!  Not only that, but our Universe is only &lt;i&gt;three minutes old&lt;/i&gt; at this point!  What comes next?  Come back for part eight...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/the_greatest_story_ever_told_-_6.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269286776192"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=12607">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ed2014a208cf3c1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Stepping off the narrow path of reality</title><published>2010-03-22T19:15:29Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T19:15:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/22/stepping-off-the-narrow-path-of-reality/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve said here before that the path of reality is razor-thin: there’s only one way to be right, but an infinite number of ways to be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, that narrow path is like a single, unbroken strand, but each path of unreality leads to every other. If you can chuck reality into the dustbin, then all manners of silliness seem equally plausible. You might think that believing in Santa Claus is a lot sillier than believing in homeopathy, but really they’re the same: &lt;em&gt;they’re both fantasy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For support in this thesis of mine, I present to you &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/science/earth/04climate.html"&gt;an article in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; about how politicians who attack evolution legislatively are now also attacking global warming. This doesn’t surprise me at all, for two reason. One is that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/02/21/you-cant-resolve-away-climate-change/"&gt;I’ve already written about dumb legislation in South Dakota and Utah trying to resolve away climate change&lt;/a&gt;, resolutions filled with nonsense and ridiculous assertions that fly in the face of what we know. That’s empirical proof that politicians are willing to try to legislate narrow partisan beliefs into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other reason I’m not surprised is that, over the past decade or so in particular, we’ve seen the far right promote fantasy over reality. Abstinence-only education, creationism, global warming denialism, defunding stem cell research, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/25/republican-party-still-shilling-antiscience/"&gt;the mocking of volcano research, fruit fly research, planetarium star projectors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows to me that once you buy into one flavor of candy-coated nonsense, they all start to taste pretty good. But we have to be adults here, and understand that you can’t live on candy. In fact, too much makes you sick. And that’ll make walking that narrow path that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269286400650"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=9868">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b5dbeb93e8550d8e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Sam Harris: Science can answer moral questions</title><published>2010-03-22T19:33:19Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T19:33:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/sam-harris-science-can-answer-moral-questions/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sam’s long-awaited TED video (23 minutes), on his idea that science can actually tell us what is moral, is just up &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  A book is coming out in a few months.  I haven’t yet seen this video, as I’m giving a talk in Texas in an hour, but for sure this is going to be really, really controversial.&lt;/p&gt;

It was another conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, the locus of all things evolutionist on the interwebs was found on Usenet, in a group called talk.origins, where a motley mob of ruthless science proponents regularly mocked and crushed creationists and honed their skills at rhetorical combat. I came out of that particular culture (and, by the way, the commenting rules here, with a policy of limited interference with the substance of people's comments, grew straight out of talk.origins). &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/talk.origins/topics?hl=en"&gt;Talk.Origins&lt;/a&gt; still exists as a discussion group, and evolved into a &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/"&gt;very useful web site&lt;/a&gt;, as well, and many of the regulars who haunted Usenet have since branched out into blogs, suchs as &lt;a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/"&gt;The Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, quite a few of the illustrious and honored masters of talk.origins are Australian. So, as long as I was there in Australia, we had to meet up and share our plans for world domination. It was kind of like a meeting of the Illuminati, only we're mostly poor academics and civil servants, and our only magic power is our obsession with flooding the internet. Here's one photo of the group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/cabal.jpeg" width="425" height="319" alt="cabal.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They are, from left to right in the back: Cartman (respect our authoritah), 
&lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil.html"&gt;John Wilkins&lt;/a&gt; (master of sowing confusion with philosophy), 
&lt;a href="http://duoquartuncia.blogspot.com/"&gt;Chris Ho-Stuart&lt;/a&gt; (the milquetoast atheist), 
&lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/contact.html"&gt;Jim Foley&lt;/a&gt; (most definitely a hominid),
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; (biggest mouth), and
&lt;a href="http://ediacaran.blogspot.com/"&gt;Chris Nedin&lt;/a&gt; (biggest &lt;a href="http://ediacaran.blogspot.com/2008/11/introduction-to-ediacaran-fauna.html"&gt;Dick&lt;/a&gt; (seriously, he showed us the award) (and photos of the real thing) (it's over a meter long!)). In front is &lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2010/03/howlerfest-2010.html"&gt;Ian Musgrave&lt;/a&gt; (best beard). You should be reading their blogs! Especially if our plans for world domination come to fruition, since you will want a leg up in flattering your masters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, while I was in Canberra, I spoke at a Skeptics in the Pub meeting, which was held in a very classy pub, &lt;a href="http://www.kingomalleys.com.au/"&gt;King O'Malley's&lt;/a&gt;. It was rather interesting in that more people showed up than was convenient (several hundred), and they were sort of draped into all kinds of nooks and crannies. It was also one of those talks where I gave a short introduction (literally, I read the intro to the book I&amp;#39;m working on), and then didn&amp;#39;t get to the rest because we just ended up doing a long Q&amp;amp;A for the rest of our time.

&lt;p&gt;I am not in that picture. I'm somewhere way off screen, hiding from the mob, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

Three weeks ago, I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4016"&gt;announced that we were recruiting new bloggers&lt;/a&gt; to replace Amy, to bolster areas of weakness among our bloggers, and expand our repertoire. I thank those of you who have responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that none of you have heard anything from us other than perhaps an acknowledgment of receiving your application, I thought it reasonable to give a brief update. Due to a combination of the death crud (of which those of you who are my Facebook friends may be aware), a challenging couple of weeks at work, and various other concerns, I haven’t made as much progress in evaluating potential new bloggers as I had hoped. I had hoped that we would have at least been able to start sending out an offer or two by now. All I can ask is: Be patient. And, if you know of any quality bloggers who haven’t been proposed already, please let me know. We are evaluating candidates, and it shouldn’t be long before I start communicating with the top applicants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, the sign asks, in small, condescending, black letters, “Are your needs too big for God?”  I reflexively yelled back at the sign, driving by the other day, that yes, actually they are, irritated at being patronized by this small collaboration of plastic, electricity, and judgment so lovingly and cleverly arranged by a well meaning pastor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may call me arrogant; accuse me of thinking too much; tell me I need to surrender my pride to the mystery they call god.  But I have needs…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be responsible for my actions, good and bad; no devil to take the blame, no god to take the credit.  True goodness arises from the desire to do good for its own sake, not from the fear of an angry god’s vengeance, or the hope of his eternal reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to be in control of my life, and to know that the things beyond my control happen due to chance, not because I somehow deserve them; good or ill.  There’s peace and fairness in that idea; the freedom not to have to believe that a child somehow deserves cancer, or that natural disasters are punishment from god; or that an all knowing, all loving god could consciously set up a system in which such suffering was possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to think for myself, whatever the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to live in a world that makes sense to me; that I can understand through observation and experience; to revel in life’s mysteries not because they are unknowable, but in the anticipation of uncovering their secrets and unwrapping new questions; to glory in the fact that I exist at all; to marvel at the incredible sequence of events over the billions of years leading up to this moment, sitting here, pondering, writing; wondering at the fact that I can understand at all; one configuration among billions of possibilities in a molecular struggle for survival that accidentally created consciousness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need more than “God did it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need the freedom to change my mind in the face of new information; to maintain intellectual honesty and an open mind; to be humbled by the notion that everything I think I know could be wrong; and out of this uncertainty, to endeavor to treat those who do not share my worldview with respect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to decide for myself what my life means, and how best to spend it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t yet come across a god big enough to meet my needs, and I’m certainly not about to settle for the god of preachy roadside church signs.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269281830505"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/david-gorski-on-the-anti-science-anti-vaccination-wing-of-the-autism-community.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2deb7baf84d863c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="autism"/><title type="html">David Gorski on the anti-science, anti-vaccination wing of the autism community</title><published>2010-03-22T18:11:08Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T18:11:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/david-gorski-on-the-anti-science-anti-vaccination-wing-of-the-autism-community.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="Science-Based Medicine » J.B.

Handley and the anti-vaccine movement: Gloating over the decline in confidence among parents about vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consistent with this, it would appear that J.B has finally let his “I’m not anti-vaccine” mask drop. Last week, Handley laid down an unusually candid bit of his typical braggadocio about a recent study that appeared in the journal Pediatrics about parental attitudes towards vaccination. Tellingly, he entitled it Tinderbox: U.S. Vaccine Fears up 700% in 7 years, in which he gloated about having been responsible for the increasing mistrust of vaccines among parents. Since Handley prominently mentions yours truly, I felt that a bit of a friendly rejoinder was in order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269281830504"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/implausible-health-claims-and-human-studies-ethics-a-collision-course.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e57dea60ea3c6b4e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism and Quackery"/><title type="html">Implausible Health Claims and Human Studies Ethics: A Collision Course</title><published>2010-03-22T18:08:40Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T18:08:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/implausible-health-claims-and-human-studies-ethics-a-collision-course.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;a title="Science-Based Medicine » KA at Boston Skeptics in the Pub March 29" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4275"&gt;Science-Based Medicine » KA at Boston Skeptics in the Pub March 29&lt;/a&gt;.

Title:
&lt;strong&gt;
Implausible Health Claims and Human Studies Ethics: A Collision Course&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Description:

A broad international consensus regarding protections for subjects in human trials emerged during the 2nd half of the 20th century. It can be summarized in several tenets, most of which pertain explicitly or implicitly to scientific considerations. Recent projects involving human trials of implausible health claims (”CAM”) have been at odds with some of those tenets. I’ll discuss one trial in detail and mention a few others. I will argue that all such trials are likely to be unethical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269281278106"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/03/hcr_democracy.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b8c64a17ee81bea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Health care reform---democracy in action</title><published>2010-03-22T18:59:08Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T18:59:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/eQyAO2wpq1U/hcr_democracy.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/03/hcr_democracy.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's hard to imagine the that the hyperbolic rhetoric that characterized the health care reform debate could get any worse (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/08/the_zombie_lie_that_just_wont.php"&gt;death panels&lt;/a&gt;, etc.).

The overestimates are even greater when subjects are asked to wear a heavy backpack.  The effect of the backpack was thought to be due to an influence of physiology on conscious perception, but a new study by Durgin and colleagues suggests it might result from subjects guessing the purpose of the experiment....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

They are angry that no matter how they engage in this debate, this body moves forward against their will.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Shame on us. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Shame on this body. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Shame on each and every one of you who substitutes your will and your desires above those of your fellow countrymen.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If we pass this bill, there will be no turning back.  It will be the last straw for the American people. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“And In a democracy, you can only ignore the will of the people for so long and get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“And if we defy the will of our fellow citizens and pass this bill, we are going to be held to account by those who have placed us in their trust.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We will have shattered those bonds of trust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’m sure if asked he will say that “being held to account” means being voted out of office.  And that’s fair.  If, as Boehner says, our representatives ignored the will or their constituents, then they will probably lose their seats.  My own rep voted exactly as I would have instructed him: “Yea.” This will earn him my future vote.  The true subversion is Beohner’s claim that his opinion is the majority opinion, and that those have fought for health care reform have subverted democracy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have news for Boehner.  His party lost the last election.  They may win the next one, but this one they lost.  That means they are in the minority, a word seemingly unfamiliar to him.  What “minority” means is that he represents the smaller part of the American public.  He cannot rightly claim to represent me or anyone else outside the 8th district of Ohio or the House republican delegation, a delegation that is currently in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is how democracy works: if the voters like what you’re doing, they vote for you.  If they don’t, you’re out.  Continuing calls for subverting the will of the people as expressed in last night’s vote are immoral and antidemocratic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/0g8mcZqnqHQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269280354769"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/?p=4383">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d3467429e52aeb8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Health"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Obamacare</title><published>2010-03-22T17:03:34Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T17:03:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CosmicVarianceBlog/~3/yPtsL2Bt4iw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/22/obamacare/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good news and bad news last night, as &lt;a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/dems-pass-historic-health-care-bill.php"&gt;the House passed health care reform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is:  the House passed health care reform.  &lt;a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/not-over-yet-senate-must-finalize-health-care.php"&gt;The work isn’t completely done yet&lt;/a&gt;, of course.  The House had already passed a heath care bill, months ago, but this isn’t it; last night they passed the Senate’s version of the Bill, which had some glaring flaws.  Under ordinary circumstances the House and Senate would get together and hammer out a compromise between their two bills.  But in the meantime Republicans picked up an extra Senate seat in Massachusetts after Teddy Kennedy died, and they had promised to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster_%28United_States_Senate%29"&gt;filibuster&lt;/a&gt; the compromise package.  (Because, after all, what courageous moral stand could be worth invoking arcane parliamentary procedures more than the fight to prevent millions of people from getting health insurance, especially if that was the life’s goal of the Senator whose death allowed you to improve from having twenty fewer votes than the opposition to only having eighteen fewer votes?)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Obama will sign the Senate bill that the House just approved, and then the Senate will consider a reconciliation bill also passed by the House last night.  Under even-more-arcane procedures, the reconciliation measure can be passed without threat of filibuster.  It requires only “majority vote,” a quaint notion in this highly baroque age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/03/how_big_is_the_bill_really.html"&gt;not an especially huge bill&lt;/a&gt;, whatever you may have heard, but it will have an impact.  Here is a &lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/what-you-get-when-hcr-passes"&gt;list of the major impacts&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/03/21/us/health-care-reform.html"&gt;interactive graphic to figure out how you will be affected&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act"&gt;most important features&lt;/a&gt; seem to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_exchange"&gt;health insurance exchanges&lt;/a&gt;, and provide subsidies for people below four times the poverty line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guarantee insurance for people with pre-existing conditions, and eliminate “rescissions” that take away insurance from people who get sick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push business to provide insurance for their employees, and self-employed individuals to buy insurance for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donut_hole_%28Medicare%29"&gt;“donut hole”&lt;/a&gt; in the existing Medicare payout structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/03/the_five_most_promising_cost_c.html"&gt;cost controls&lt;/a&gt; (mostly through slowing the growth of Medicare spending), thereby &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Deficit_impact"&gt;lowering the budget deficit&lt;/a&gt; by $130 billion over the first ten years, and by another $1 trillion over the next ten years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it’s a relatively incremental bill, placing bandages over some of the more egregious wounds in the current system, while leaving in place the essential structure through which we funnel billions of dollars to middlemen while &lt;a href="http://blogs.ngm.com/blog_central/2009/12/the-cost-of-care.html"&gt;paying far more for medical care per person than any other country without getting better results.&lt;/a&gt;  For 90% of Americans, coverage and insurance will continue as before.  Basically, this brings us a little closer to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kjhealy/status/10852366160"&gt;where Western Europe was a century ago&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Still, a tremendous political accomplishment — maybe not from the perspective of what we were hoping for when Democrats took control of both houses of Congress and the Presidency in 2008, but certainly from the perspective of the last couple of months, when it often seemed like we weren’t going to get anything at all.  More than anyone, credit for the accomplishment goes to &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34753.html"&gt;Nancy Pelosi&lt;/a&gt;, who didn’t give up when things looked grim.  From now on she won’t simply be known as the first female Speaker of the House, but one of the most effective leaders in its history.  Here she is marching to the Capitol yesterday, arms linked with civil-rights pioneer Representative John Lewis from Georgia, carrying the gavel that was used when Medicare was passed in 1965.  An historic moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/lYNV08ufTRI%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the bad news.  One of the reasons why Pelosi was marching with Lewis was to demonstrate support a day after this man who had marched at Selma &lt;a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/tea-partiers-call-lewis-nr-frank-ft-at-capitol-hill-protest.php"&gt;was repeatedly called “nigger”&lt;/a&gt; by protesters outside the Capitol.  Ugly by itself, but worse in context:  it’s becoming harder and harder to have a meaningful debate in this country without participating in a race to the rhetorical bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There exist reasonable arguments against health-care reform; not arguments I agree with, but ones that at least make superficial sense.  It costs money to provide insurance for the uninsured, and someone will have to pay.  Asking healthy people to buy insurance will be a burden to them.  There will be less extra money floating around if we cut down on unnecessary costs, which might impede the pace of medical innovation.  (I didn’t say they were great arguments, just that they made superficial sense.)  But these aren’t the arguments that are actually made most frequently.  Instead we hear that the Democrats are &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2010/03/21/mcmegan-meltdown/"&gt;abandoning the principles of representative democracy&lt;/a&gt; by passing legislation while they control both legislative houses and the executive; or that liberals won’t stop until they have swept away the last vestiges of personal choice in American life; or that the government wants to decide when to kill granny.  Right-wing bloggers &lt;a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2010/03/channeling-his-inner-redshirt"&gt;nod with approval&lt;/a&gt; at the idea that people are stocking up on guns, preparing for fighting in the streets.  The race to find the most scary and overheated characterization of a pretty benign state of affairs is a fierce one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most depressing aspect of the situation is not the existence of crazy fringe elements — those will always be with us, on both sides of any issue — but of the reinforcing dynamic between the fringe and the supposedly respectable parts of the Republican party.  It’s been clear for a while to most people (outside the White House, anyway) that Republicans in Congress made a clear choice that their own self-interests are served by preventing Democrats from passing any meaningful legislation, whatever that might mean for the good of the country.  Speeches during House “debate” last night consistently &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/21/AR2010032103484.html?sid=ST2010032103510"&gt;played to the worst aspects of the protesting mob&lt;/a&gt;.  One Congressman &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/22/stupak-called-baby-killer-house-floor/"&gt;shouted “baby killer!”&lt;/a&gt; at Democrat Bart Stupak, who is staunchly anti-abortion, as he spoke to support the bill.  [&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;:  it was &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/03/stupak-called-baby-killer-on-h.html"&gt;Randy Neugebauer (R-Tex.)&lt;/a&gt;.]  Two protesters &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the House chamber were arrested for being disruptive — and “&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35965961/ns/politics-capitol_hill/?ocid=twitter"&gt;several Republican lawmakers stood up and cheered during the interruption&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest you think this is simply concern-trolling from a liberal telling conservatives to be less intrusive, note that conservative commentators like &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2010/03/21/the-party-of-fox/"&gt;David Frum&lt;/a&gt; are making the same point:  the rhetoric has gotten out of hand, and it’s not good for anybody, except maybe the “conservative entertainment industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on a soapbox for months now about the harm that our overheated talk is doing to us. Yes it mobilizes supporters – but by mobilizing them with hysterical accusations and pseudo-information, overheated talk has made it impossible for representatives to represent and elected leaders to lead. The real leaders are on TV and radio, and they have very different imperatives from people in government. Talk radio thrives on confrontation and recrimination. When Rush Limbaugh said that he wanted President Obama to fail, he was intelligently explaining his own interests. What he omitted to say – but what is equally true – is that he also wants Republicans to fail. If Republicans succeed – if they govern successfully in office and negotiate attractive compromises out of office – Rush’s listeners get less angry. And if they are less angry, they listen to the radio less, and hear fewer ads for Sleepnumber beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what the end game is — whether it’s possible to step back to a more reasonable dialogue.  Disagreement is good, and it’s important to have an active and engaged opposition party, no matter who the majority party might be.  But whipping up hysteria at the cost of working together constructively isn’t in anyone’s interests.  Obama campaigned on a message of hope and change and bipartisan togetherness, and I think that was a sincere message on his part; but it certainly hasn’t come to pass, and there doesn’t seem to be any indication that it will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation with a friend I thought others might  find interesting, so I’ll share part of it here along with some  additional commentary. She wrote to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I’m  in progress of reading every article on your &lt;a href="http://humanistcontemplative.blogspot.com/"&gt;humanistcontemplative.blogspot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great stuff. So far, the only thing which strikes me as  different from my own beliefs is the inclusion of compassion as some  essential component of philosophy or of being a philosopher. Although I  highly value compassion, I see it as more of a human trait; not  universal but one of many emotions. I’m reminded of what Nietzsche said  about empathy, something to the effect of that it drains strength. And  at the risk of sounding cliché, Nietzsche’s thought has most profoundly  affected me over the years. For example, the difference between what he  calls “master morality” and “slave morality”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The term  Humanist only bothers me by the thought of placing some special  importance on humans. I’ve settled into what I can only describe as a  loose pantheism, which is sort of a mixture of what you describe in “&lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8993-Houston-Humanist-Examiner%7Ey2010m3d18-Two-approaches-to-desire"&gt;Two  approaches to desire&lt;/a&gt;” because I understand both the incredible  transience of life, but also the utility of irrational exuberance and  the dangers of rational nihilism. Um well, these are thing more fun to  speak of in person but I guess it could be summed up as “The existence  of the world is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m  honored you like my articles, thanks for reading &lt;img src="http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the  compassion thing, the best thing I could recommend on that from myself  would be ‘&lt;a href="http://humanistcontemplative.blogspot.com/2008/05/freethought-and-compassion.html"&gt;Freethought  and Compassion&lt;/a&gt;‘. On the term ‘Humanism’ and human emphasis, I’d  read ‘&lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8993-Houston-Humanist-Examiner%7Ey2009m7d30-Does-humanism-exclude-nonhumans"&gt;Does  Humanism exclude non-humans?&lt;/a&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Freethought  and Compassion” presents a very good argument. I agree 100%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also the non-speciesist origin of humanism; I wasn’t aware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certainly living with compassion makes for a better life for the  practitioner. What concerns me are moral questions such as giving to  beggars. Situations where you can choose to practice either a  short-sighted compassion, or something which appears mean in the short  term but ultimately alleviates or prevents suffering on a larger scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too many people shut off their brains while trying to be  compassionate. Then there’s the mindset which so many fall into, that of  looking down on and pitying others while feeding on the ego boost of  being able to help slightly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another issue is that, as free  thinkers we understand the open ended nature of reality, the lack of  absolutes -and compose a personal morality based on reason. But a  majority of people have neither the time or inclination to inspect  reality. It leads me to think of the utility of a hierarchical or cast  system, but I can’t begin to surmise what that would entail. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All  good points. On the matter of short term help vs longer term, these  things come up often, such as the case in which a doctor may need to  inflict a little suffering to treat the patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these  things we will all need to run our calculus and take the best course we  can, but ultimately we have to remind ourselves that our calculations on  what actions will lead to what results are highly prone to error and  based on incomplete information. This is why we cannot be too concerned  with the outcome of externals, but rather, our internal motivation.  Being sure our character, our intentions, and our actions are pure and  motivated by compassion is what we must do in order to achieve a deeper  contentment in life I think. How all of that plays out in terms of  consequentialism is a matter for Nature/physics/the Logos/karma to worry  about and therefore somewhat irrelevant to our walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for  the utility of cast systems, that too is an outward approach focused on  seeking control over externals – in seeking to instill some larger scale  template of how we imagine things “ought” to be and how others “should”  behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I have been at my most confused, most  distressed, and all of the machinations of if/then scenarios are going  through my head and I don’t know what to do – I have found that if I  just fall back on the simple power of compassion and act from that,  without fear, greed, or hopefully delusion, then things may not always  turn out how we thought or hoped, but it will never let you down. You  can rest easy knowing you acted in a pure way. At least, that has been  my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good answer…  I’ve not found fault with any of your augments; it just seems to leave  something out that I can’t quite place -something of the animal struggle  which has shaped mankind. The aspect of competition and survival of the  fitted… Certainly compassion is a good strategy for both internal  peace and getting along in the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s just had to wrap  my mind around applying compassion to all the situations we encounter in  life. It doesn’t seem possible in for example scarcity of resources  –but that’s just my mind trying to grasp a more universal property of  cycles; life and death. Compassion is universal-enough in the context of  this human life. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should follow our with a  few comments here. It seems to me that many philosophers engage in  ‘descriptive philosophy’ – that is, they seek to understand how human  beings function socially and ethically, and describe it as they might  describe the function of weather, the rotation of the planet, or the  organization of an ant colony. This investigative realm is certainly a  valid and important part of philosophy, but it is a bit different than  the search for the ‘good life’ and the practices to move closer to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of ‘animal struggles that have shaped mankind’ fit  comfortably in descriptive philosophy. Marcus Aurelius himself said that  life was more like wrestling than dancing. But in the end these notions  are merely academic and must ultimately boil down to meaningful  prescriptions on priorities, principles, and how we live if they are to  be of use. Perhaps I should restate some conclusions from &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-8993-Houston-Humanist-Examiner%7Ey2009m7d16-On-retribution-how-bad-people-lose-part-1"&gt;On  Retribution&lt;/a&gt;, but a system focused on conflict and struggle over  resources has not been shown to be a path conducive to real happiness as  far as I’ve noticed. A big part of exploring how a contemplative  philosophy functions in the face of scarcity of resources, will be the  arrival at a place where we realize that biological survival is not the  top priority, and death not the worst fate. A lot of folly has come from  people getting too carried away about matters of life and death, as if  any of us could escape the latter. How strange for a species whose  individuals have never commonly lived even a single century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My  friend mentioned Nietzsche earlier and I am certainly no expert on his  works. I’ve read that he was an admirer of Heraclitus, who inspired the  Stoics conception of Nature, but that he viewed the world in terms of  masters and slaves. The timeless competition between these two modes of  though explained much about the history of Europe and America according  to him. Yet Epictetus, with whom I’d agree, would say that we are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of  us slaves, every one. It seems to me there is the potential for only &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; master and one kingdom – and that is myself and my will. If I am to  rebel, then I should rebel first against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard of Mr. Randi when he debunked Uri Geller&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;act&amp;quot; in 1975.  I had met Mr. Geller personally in 1973 and was both charmed and had a feeling I couldn&amp;#39;t put a finger on.  It was my &amp;quot;flim flam meter&amp;quot; pinging, and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Uri-Geller-James-Randi/dp/0345247965"&gt;Mr. Randi's book&lt;/a&gt; helped me to understand and use my "flim flam meter" in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Mr. Randi announced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/914-how-to-say-it.html"&gt; I’m gay.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This announcement was not a surprise to Mr. Randi&amp;#39;s associates.  But it still took courage.  In his published statement, Mr. Randi noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I’m prepared to receive the inevitable barrage of jeers and insults from the “grubbies” out there who will jump to their keyboards in glee to notify others of their kind about this statement, which to them will be yet further proof of the perfidy of the rationalist mode of life that I have chosen. Those titters of joy will be unheard over the murmur of acceptance that I confidently expect from my friends.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Well, I am not a friend of Mr. Randi's; merely an admirer.  But I think that it took courage to come out at the age of 81.  And it's a shout of "welcome to being who you are, in public as well as in private".

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andyi/2402001517/in/set-72157612589019892"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2383/2402001517_1fd26f64ae_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A lot of us already knew this, although I don’t know how widespread the knowledge is. I imagine this will surprise some folks, but not others. Some may wonder why he waited this long… but he makes it clear why in both &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/914-how-to-say-it.html"&gt;his announcement on Swift&lt;/a&gt; as well as in his interview with JREF President (and openly gay man) D.J. Grothe on his podcast &lt;a href="http://www.forgoodreason.org/james_randi_a_skeptic_comes_out_at_81"&gt;For Good Reason&lt;/a&gt;. D.J.’s interview with Randi is excellent; they discuss how this molded Randi’s life, his thoughts on gay marriage, his frequent mentioning of Sophia Loren (which made me smile), and how this affects (or more accurately, does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; affect) the JREF’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out about the announcement right before a friend came to pick me up, and I told him about it. We chatted about it for a moment, and then he asked me, &amp;quot;What difference will this make?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a darn good question. For me it makes no difference, and wouldn’t had I known or not before the announcement. At some level it’s always interesting to find out personal information about someone you know, or someone you respect — it’s not exactly gossip, just more info that leads to a feeling of knowing someone better. I know most people, certainly an overwhelming majority, will support Randi with this. Some won’t like it, and it may be that a lot of Randi’s detractors will delight in trying to use this against him. I look forward to watching them reap &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; whirlwind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it’s a good thing for the LGBT community, because now yet another person of some stature will lend his own credibility to the movement. Just being open and comfortably gay without making a point of it will establish that this is just another of the many flavors humans come in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to answer my friend’s question, this won’t change Randi or the JREF. But there is still a lot of prejudice about homosexuality — and certainly a lot of that comes from &amp;quot;cultural conservatives&amp;quot; as D.J. called them — and the more we have this out in the open, the more people will be used to it. As that happens, that sense of &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; diminishes, and we learn to accept differences and diversity more easily and naturally. And that is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good thing indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad Randi has talked about this, and I’m proud of him.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, it was a pleasure to hear narrator Oprah Winfrey refer to evolution and geologic time as the uncontroversial facts that they are. The series is on every Sunday night through April 18, and I will probably try to catch most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The black and white photographs depict stylized architectural elements in gravestones, cemetery gates and storefront shops. Lewis took the photos during her 20-year career in Nebraska.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, she focuses on the Nebraskan Czech population and their connection with cemeteries.  It turns out they had their own, but &lt;a href="http://www.journalstar.com/entertainment/arts-and-culture/visual/article_97d22af8-32f0-11df-9513-001cc4c03286.html"&gt;not necessarily because they wanted to be segregated&lt;/a&gt; from everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“About 50 percent of Czechs who immigrated (to America) had no religious affiliation,” she said. “They were agnostic and called themselves ‘free thinkers.’ Because of this, Catholics and Protestants refused to bury them in their cemeteries. So the Czechs had their own.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t you love that?  Even in death, the Christians didn’t want to be mixed with the heathens.  These are likely the same people who insist that we’ll end up in the same place in the afterlife, no matter what we say during our lives.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they still don’t want you nearby, even when you’re dead.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus must have insisted on that.&lt;/p&gt;

Lyell designated the split of the Pliocene by recognizing a higher percentage of extant snails and other mollusks found in strata from this Newer Pliocene or, now, Pleistocene period. About 70 percent of the mollusks from this period were extant animals, compared with 50 - 70 percent from the Older Pliocene.Today, snails are still used as an important index for reconstructing paleoenvironments. Michal Horsák and researchers from the Czech Republic, Russia, Poland and Slovakia published a study a couple of weeks back in the Journal of Biogeography that attempts to determine the ecology of full-glacial Europe using index species like snails and trees to identify possible refugia - modern environmental/ecological analogs of the coldest periods in Europe tens of thousands of years ago based on fossil evidence and modern assemblages.Recently, evidence has pointed to the Russian Altai and Sayan Mountains as modern analogs. The climate matches, cool and relatively dry. Surface pollen spectra in these areas are very similar to samples from full-glacial central Europe. The ranges are also home to similar and in some cases, identical biota. Mammal assemblages are largely comparable. So-called sibling species of trees from full-glacial Europe have been found in the area, including the Siberian pine, Siberian larch and Round-leaved dwarf birch(related to or subspecies of the Swiss pine, European larch and arctic dwarf birch respectively).Photo by Ondřej ŽváčekThe most important biotic reference is the snails found in the Altai Mountains for several reasons, as the authors note:First, snail shells can be easily identified to species, whereas plant pollen is often identifiable only to genus or family. Second, each shell represents one individual, which enables an accurate estimation of population density. Third, unlike pollen or vertebrate remains, snail fossils are usually deposited in places where they lived, thus enabling a fine spatial resolution of the resulting palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Fourth, snail fossils are well preserved in conditions that are usually poor in other fossils, especially in dry and calcium-rich sediments.Samples were taken at 118 sites in a 300 km transect in southern Siberia, 10 x 10 m2 plots and the sites were all characterized according to environmental conditions. The researchers used 13 designations, and instead of reinterpreting or just glossing them over, I'd rather just quote in detail since they were able succinctly describe each environment. These categories are not only important in interpreting the results, they give a good impression of what the environment is like in this portion of the Altai Mountains (n signifies the number of sampled sites).Taiga (n = 11): mesic to wet coniferous forest with a species-poor herb layer and a well developed moss layer, usually dominated by Abies sibirica, Larix sibirica, Picea obovata or Pinus sibirica.Hemiboreal forest (n = 22): dry to mesic coniferous or deciduous forest with a species-rich herb layer and a sparse moss layer, usually dominated by Betula pendula, Larix sibirica or Pinus sylvestris.Wooded fen (n = 2): wet woodland with accumulation of base-rich organic sediment, dominated by Picea obovata.Treeless fen (n = 4): open base-rich fen with sedges and mosses.Acidic mire (n = 7): bogs and mineral-poor fens.Alluvial scrub (n = 3): riverine woody vegetation with willows (Salix spp.).Tall-forb vegetation (n = 5): tall herbaceous vegetation in wet places, usually along mountain streams.Alpine grassland (n = 3): short herbaceous vegetation above the timberline.Shrubby tundra (n = 8): low-shrub vegetation above the timberline, dominated mainly by Betula rotundifolia (= B. nana s.l.), in places also by Dryas oxyodonta.Steppe (n = 36): both short-grass steppe and tall-grass (meadow) steppe, in places with low shrubs such as Caragana or Spiraea.Saline grassland (n = 4): grassland on soils with elevated salt concentration, usually in shallow depressions in steppe landscapes.Meadow (n = 8): mesic grassland used for regular or occasional hay-making.Scree (n = 5): treeless talus slopes.As you can see, steppe and Hemiboreal forest tend to dominate the landscape, dry, cold areas very similar to what is thought to have been the conditions of central Europe during Pleistocene glacial periods. The strange thing, generally speaking, is that snails are poikilothermic animals, meaning that their body temperature is susceptible to changes in ambient temperature, placing them under risk during sudden cold snaps. The authors suspect that these relict snails have not colonized warmer areas because of increased predatory pressures, which seems to line up with a particular ecological circumstance: homeothermic predators have higher metabolic requirements and might not be able to live in certain areas where these poikilotherms thrive.Most of the index species of snails in this study were found in wooded or shrubby areas, wet microclimates protected by tree canopy or shrub cover. These wooded areas tended to be dominated by Larix sibirica and Picea obovata, the sibling species of the European L. decidua and P. abies, evidence that the vast steppes of full-glacial Europe may not have been as devoid of trees as previously thought.So the reconstruction proceeds, trying to refine the conditions of ancient ecosystems and biomes under particular climatic or geologic pressures. It's a fascinating process, assembling such seemingly disparate evidences and mechanisms reaching across an interdisciplinary expanse to make relatively small but essential contributions like this one....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Diana Gitig to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Diane Gitig pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Diane%20Gitig%20pic.jpg" width="261" height="448" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;I live in White Plains, a suburb of New York.  I have a Ph.D. in cell biology but was not particularly well suited to lab work.  My thesis advisor suggested that writing might better play to my strengths.  I had my first baby the week after I defended my thesis, and I have been writing on a freelance basis since then.  I was pretty much doing the stay-at-home mom thing, writing when the babies were sleeping for my own mental stimulation and to try to keep my foot in the door.  I am very grateful to the feminist movement (and my husband's salary) because I always knew that my staying at home was a choice, not a given; any day I woke up and decided I wanted to get a job, I could try to do so.  I very much enjoyed being home with my little ones, but I view it as just one chapter in my life, and it is ending now that my youngest went off to school in September.  This precipitated a minor identity crisis:  I really thought about how I perceive myself, and not just what do I want to do but who do I want to be?  After much introspection I decided to try to be a full time freelance science writer.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat ironically, I have fallen into this niche of writing about laboratory techniques - the very methods at which I did not excel in graduate school.  My favorite assignments were reviewing science and science fiction books as a freelance editor at amazon, since I actually like reading more than I like writing, and a couple of articles I wrote for Science.  I know it is not at all like having a Science paper, but it is somewhat thrilling to be published there just the same.  Covering symposia at the New York Academy of Sciences was also fun, as I got to get out and meet interesting people but still do the bulk of the work on my own time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, efficient scheduling is a big challenge for me these days - I am very happy to have a number of assignments, but time management is a skill I have not used in a while and have to relearn.  My goals are to keep busy and learn cool stuff.  So far, so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online activity is essential in what I do.  I literally could not have this career and this life without it.  I work with editors and interview scientists and entrepreneurs all over the world, and I cannot imagine doing so without the ability to send work back and forth instantly.  Having access to papers at home is invaluable.  The ability to work alone and at home can obviously have a downside too, but Twitter takes care of that by helping me feel connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really impressed by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, so I read his stuff now.  I enjoyed talking to &lt;a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Jonathan Eisen&lt;/a&gt;, so I look at his now too.  And yours of course.  I also made some contacts that have enabled me to contribute to some blog-like sites, which has been great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure the Mexican chocolate &lt;a href="http://www.ilovelocopops.com/" title=""&gt;Locopops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in terms of content, I really, really loved &lt;a href="http://www.michaelspecter.com/" title=""&gt;Michael Specter'&lt;/a&gt;s address on Friday night.  It totally resonated with me.  He spoke about a lot of things I had been thinking about, but he verbalized them much more clearly than I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you in person and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You too!

&lt;i&gt;Continuing with the tradition from last two years, I will occasionally post interviews with some of the participants of the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt; conference that was held in the Research Triangle Park, NC back in January. See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Ivan Oransky from &lt;a href="http://www.reutershealth.com/en/index.html" title=""&gt;Reuters Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Embargo Watch&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the New York suburbs. I earned a bachelor's in biology, then trained as an MD, and got through a year of psychiatry residency before leaving medicine to be a full-time journalist. Along the way, I spent four summers and some other time working in basic science labs, studying the complement system and &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11153077" title=""&gt;pediatric infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt;. Today, I'm the executive editor of &lt;a href="http://reutershealth.com/" title=""&gt;Reuters Health&lt;/a&gt;, based in New York, where I live in the less and less appropriately named neighborhood of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen,_Manhattan" title=""&gt;Hell's Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;. My wife and I split time between there and western Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ivan Oransky pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Ivan%20Oransky%20pic.jpg" width="336" height="448" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;I left medicine in 1999, but I had been committing journalism since I &lt;a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/writer/2236/Ivan__Oransky/" title=""&gt;set foot in the Harvard Crimson&lt;/a&gt; as a freshman in 1990. (Or perhaps more accurately, since I joined my &lt;a href="http://www.ccsd.edu/north/publications/archive.html" title=""&gt;high school paper&lt;/a&gt; in 1986.) I eventually edited the Crimson's science and health coverage, and became executive editor. In medical school, I edited the medical student section of JAMA, and wrote for other outlets including the Baltimore Sun, The New Republic, and U.S. News and World Report. During my first year of residency, American Medical News was kind enough to give me a column, which a Yale dean made a point of saying embarrassed him in a letter to all of my clinical supervisors. Around that time, I also started a weekly column for The Forward, a weekly Jewish newspaper, called The Doctor. If there's a health problem Jews don't worry about, it's news to me, so I had plenty of material. Between then and now I've written for a number of other publications, from The Boston Globe to Salon to Slate to the Wall Street Journal Online. I've also co-authored books including &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/A-Z-Common-Symptom-Answer-Guide/John-Wasson/e/9780071416184" title=""&gt;The Common Symptom Answer Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first full-time journalism job, starting in May 2000, was as editor in chief of &lt;a href="http://acor.org/sgreene/praxis/post/default.htm" title=""&gt;Praxis Post&lt;/a&gt;, a webzine of medicine and culture. We had a great time and earned important recognition, including being named a finalist for the 2001 Online News Association Award for General Excellence, but soon sadly went the way of the dot-com boom. In 2002, I became web editorial director of &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/" title=""&gt;The Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, and I was promoted to deputy editor of the magazine in 2004, overseeing web as well as print. We won a slew of awards while I was there, including the Magazine of the Year Award from the American Society of Business Publication Editors. I left The Scientist in March 2008 to become managing editor of online at &lt;a href="http://scientificamerican.com/" title=""&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;, where we grew traffic by 50%. I left SciAm in June 2009 to take my current position as executive editor of Reuters Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my decade of editorial management, I've had the good fortune to have smarter and more talented people than me willing to be part of my staff. Learning from them, and working with them to implement our joint visions, has more than made up for the fact that I really don't have the time to do much of my own writing anymore. I've also benefited from generous and brilliant mentors such as former JAMA editor-in-chief &lt;a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/george-lundberg-md-joins-medpage-todayr-as-editor-at-large-85861792.html" title=""&gt;George Lundberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day job takes up most of my time, as well as my mental energy. It's a challenging time to be in journalism, as A Blog Around The Clock readers know, so just keeping up -- and improving -- the high standards of Reuters Health, while experimenting with new journalistic forms, is a full-time job. But my work at Reuters goes hand-in-hand with my three other passions: the &lt;a href="http://healthjournalism.org/" title=""&gt;Association of Health Care Journalists&lt;/a&gt;, where I'm treasurer; New York University's &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/prospectivestudents/coursesofstudy/serp/" title=""&gt;Science, Health, and Environmental Reporting Program&lt;/a&gt;, where I've taught medical journalism for eight years and have served as faculty advisor to &lt;a href="http://www.scienceline.org/" title=""&gt;Scienceline&lt;/a&gt; for four; and my new blog, &lt;a href="http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Embargo Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in all of that work is to help people commit better journalism. Some of those people are full-time journalists. Some may be training to become full-time journalists, and some may not be employed as journalists at all. But if they're writing for me, a student of mine, an AHCJ member, or reading and commenting on my blog, to me they're part of ensuring the future of journalistic ideals -- independence, accountability, and accuracy, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, there are the New York Yankees, whose season is about to get started as I write this. Which means I'll be on the subway up to my season tickets in the bleachers as often as possible...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I contributed to the news blogs at The Scientist and Scientific American, I've just started my first personal blog, &lt;a href="http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Embargo Watch&lt;/a&gt;, whose tagline is "keeping an eye on how scientific information embargoes affect news coverage." I'm an active &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ivanoransky" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook user. I'm not on Friendfeed at the moment. I am squarely in the necessity camp when it comes to this stuff. I learn something whenever our audience comments on, retweets, criticizes, or ignores what we've put out there. And the story tips -- for Reuters Health as well as for Embargo Watch -- are invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScienceOnline sessions are always great, of course, but for me the highlights of ScienceOnline2010 were, as always, the gathering of the best minds in science blogging, all of whom are available for passionate chats in the hallways and the bar. I'm not sure I can point to anything in particular, but rather to the whole experience, as spurring me to start Embargo Watch. Getting invited &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/02/how_to_avoid_he-said-she-said_science_journalism.php" title=""&gt;to guest blog&lt;/a&gt; by the wonderful &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt;, whom I met for the first time at ScienceOnline2010, was important inspiration, as was knowing I can count on the other people I met for support and guidance. This year, the cabal -- and I use that term with love -- of book authors I hung out with has also encouraged me to think about a book I want to write. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to ScienceOnline2011, 2012, and on and on. Having been to all four of them now, I can say confidently that they keep getting better. My one suggestion for 2011 and beyond is to pay attention to the potential pitfalls of ScienceOnline's success. It's already become a place a lot of people want to be, and its audience one that a lot of interests want to engage. That's a good thing. But it also means that the participants need to think carefully about conflicts of interest, funding sources, and that sort of thing. An example: Carl Zimmer and I turned to one another during the last after-dinner Ignite Talk this year and wondered, at the same moment, whom the speaker's clients were. I think the speaker was happy to tell us, but that was the sort of thing that should have been baked into a disclosure in his talk. Setting ground rules like that ahead of time will only help ScienceOnline grow and mature even more than it already has. But this isn't a criticism -- I'm just speaking from experience as someone who has been on the board of directors of a group that's only turning 12 this year.&lt;/p&gt;

Grothe to discuss the arguments and controversy engendered by Unscientific America. In the process, we got into quite a lot of detail about my views on science, religion, and free inquiry--many of which are either misunderstood or misrepresented in parts of the atheist blogosphere.

I mention this because I just noticed that a recent issue of Free Inquiry has actually printed a transcription of part of the Point of Inquiry interview, including passages like this:
FI (D.J. Grothe): In your book Unscientific America, you take on the New Atheists, even though you are an atheist. You argue that the battle should be for scientific literacy as opposed to a battle against religion. You seem to argue that when the battle is science versus religion, public scientific literacy actually suffers.
Mooney: Right. We live in an overwhelmingly religious society, and we should just admit that not all of the religious have a problem with science. It is important to refute the fundamentalists when they encroach on science education across the country in regard to evolution.

In other words, it would probably looks something like a nudibranch mollusk. Nudibranchs are also known as sea slugs or sea hares, and at first glance, they look like snack packs for predators.

Of course, nudibranchs don’t take this lightly. Rather than physical defenses, they put up chemical ones. Besides any chemicals that they keep inside, many sea hares release chemicals, too. Sea hares have two chemicals they will squirt out in the presence of a predator: ink and opaline.

To test for how these two different chemicals affect predators,  Nunsbaum and Derby looked at the inking behaviour of the California sea hare (Aplysia californica – a species well-known to neurobiologists for the many studies on memory that have been conducted on it; pictured above). They used blueheaded wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum; pictured right) as a predator. 

The sea hare is a Pacific species (hence the species name “californica,” as in California) and the wrasse is an Atlantic species, so the authors obviously can’t mimic ecological interactions with 100% realism. The choice of species is almost certainly one of convenience, but you might expect that these chemicals and such are general enough that the exact species wouldn’t matter. That said, it does open up some possibilities to check whether there might be “arms races” where species in the same region have different inks or behavioural responses to animals they live with versus animals they don&amp;#39;t.

To test the effect of the ink or opaline alone, without the actual sea hare in the tank to possibly confound things, Nunsbaum and Derby made “shrimp cubes” as a food item for the fish. They released them simultaneously with ink between the food and the fish. Ink made the fish less likely to get the food, but opaline didn’t, indicating that the ink is acting as a deterrent, partly visual.

Previous work had suggested that ink / opaline was a distraction to a predator, which would mistake it for food. They found that fish wouldn&amp;#39;t eat alginate cubes, cubes with ink, cubes with opaline, but would eat pellets that had the amino acid components contained within ink and opaline.

What about when the ink and opaline are presented with actual food? Put any ink in it, and the fish wouldn’t eat it. Literally none. Zero. Put opaline alone in it, and the fish will eat it. All of them. 100%. This experiment (plotted right) is significant by IOT*. The more complex stats just seem like going through the motions...

When ink was around, fish took longer to get to food; this got shorter if the nose was blocked. This indicates that ink has some sort of olfactory blocking in addition to being a visual distraction, 

Opaline appears to have no effect on fish at all. Curious. But this paper doesn’t speculate on what its job might be. A likely story is that opaline is a deterrent to non-fish predators, but the sea hares either can’t or don’t distinguish between predators bothering them enough to cause ink and opaline release.

* IOT = inter-ocular test. It’s something so obvious, it hits you right between the eyes.

And the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer — WISE — can really deliver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/gallery_images/WISE2010-008-lg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/WISE_rosebud.jpg" alt="WISE_rosebud" title="WISE_rosebud" width="610" height="607"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Click to emblossom.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/gallery_Cosmic_Rosebud.html"&gt;This image shows AFGL 3193&lt;/a&gt; — what looks like a rosebud — a small piece of a very complicated region of gas, dust, and stars in the constellation of Cepheus in the northern sky. This region has &lt;a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap081018.html"&gt;star formation&lt;/a&gt;, cold and hot dust, and even a supernova remnant (called &lt;a href="http://www.noao.edu/outreach/aop/observers/n7822.html"&gt;NGC 7822&lt;/a&gt;). This particular part seen by WISE shows a cluster of young stars called Berkeley 59 — the stars colored blue to the right — surrounded by the gas and dust from which they formed. This cluster is less than a million years old, and the massive, hot stars are blasting out radiation that is eating away at the cocoon surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the false-color image from WISE, red shows the coolest dust, blue and cyan warmer material, and green reveals long-chain organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. You can see how the PAHs appear to form around the rim of the nebula as the material there is compressed and warmed by the ultraviolet light and solar winds from the young stars. The filaments are testament to the forces tossed around as the stars go through their violent birth process. One of the stars in the cluster is a massive O5 star with dozens of times the mass of the Sun, and blasting out radiation at a rate 100,000 times that of the Sun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure just how big an area this image covers, but it’s roughly a degree across, twice the width of the Moon on the sky. The cluster is located about 3000 light years away, which is good: a lot of those stars will soon (well, in a few million years) explode, and this distance is far enough away that we’ll see a spectacular light show, but won’t wind up hurting us. Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WISE is designed to survey the sky in infrared, literally spinning around and scanning the entire celestial sphere. It doesn’t have a field of view per se; the data come down in a stream and the astronomers on the ground can put them together at any scale they want, a little bit like Google maps. So expect to see lots more images of objects like this one, and you can get the whole list at &lt;a href="http://wise.ssl.berkeley.edu/gallery_images.html"&gt;the WISE gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can see the &lt;a href="http://www.ncsciencefair.org/2010fair.html" title=""&gt;details here&lt;/a&gt;. The part that is open to public will be on Saturday March 27th from 2:30 - 4:00 pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href="http://www.ncsmt.org/" title=""&gt;NC Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Center&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Young scientists from across the state will gather at Meredith College in Raleigh on Sat., March 27, to participate in the N.C. Science and Engineering Fair (NCSEF). Students from 3rd grade through 12th grade will present original science and engineering research. NCSEF showcases the highest level of student achievement in the state.

&lt;p&gt;Students competing in the NCSEF were selected from last month's 10 regional competitions. Advancing to the state competition are 250 student research projects. The student projects will be available for public viewing from 2:30 and 4 p.m. in the Science and Math Building and Harris Hall on Meredith's campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In today's global economy, science, mathematics and technology are cornerstones of many countries' economic development strategy. It is imperative that we establish a passion in our youth for science and math," said Sam Houston, president and CEO of the North Carolina Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Center (SMT Center). "The North Carolina Science and Engineering Fair is designed to actively engage students in science and technology, and practice the adult skills of not only finding answers, but explaining them to others."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SMT Center's support for science competitions includes recruiting and providing training for scientists and engineers to serve as judges at the State Science and Engineering Fair as well as local and regional fairs.  According to Dr. Houston, science competitions such as the NCSEF can be an outlet for students to showcase scientific research they have conducted for high school graduation projects and other external student and community science initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students will have opportunities to compete for financial awards and the opportunity to present at two prestigious international student research competitions, among other special awards this year according to Judy Day, assistant director, Office of Undergraduate Research at North Carolina State University, and the NCSEF volunteer director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outstanding projects from 5th - 8th grade students will be nominated for the Discovery Education Young Scientist Challenge.  Selected high school students will go on to the INTEL International Science and Engineering Fair that will take place in May in San Jose, California, to display their research with 1,500 students from 40 countries. This year, two middle school projects and two high school projects will be selected to represent NCSEF at the International Sustainable World (Energy, Engineering &amp;amp; Environment) Project (ISWEEEP) in Houston, Tex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current NCSEF corporate and university sponsors include:&lt;br&gt;
•       GlaxoSmithKline&lt;br&gt;
•       Time Warner Cable: Connect A Million Minds&lt;br&gt;
•       Burroughs Wellcome Fund&lt;br&gt;
•       NC Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education Center&lt;br&gt;
•       Duke Energy&lt;br&gt;
•       Strategic Educational Alliances&lt;br&gt;
•       BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina&lt;br&gt;
•       Meredith College&lt;br&gt;
•       North Carolina State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/25590_417238123055_552853055_5261712_1940651_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/25590_417238123055_552853055_5261712_1940651_n.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="385"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Actually, to REALLY set the scene for you in terms of what this storm has done in about four hours? I usually go to this (EDFAA) library at UWA. Photo is by Laura, fellow educator and works at the uni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the lower floors of the library and I’ve sat in… well, what used to be one of the desks by that window, which has smashed inwards and sailed into all the shelves which hold all the really beautiful books on things like education, art and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, there’s a compactus near there, which holds some of the older books, just to the right of the picture. I remember that’s where I found the Philosophy of Education books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also all the library computers that they moved away from the other side of those shelves and into the centre of the building. Not too far from that window. Yes, those windows that are smashed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a chair upside down, floating, can’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll donate to the UWA fund to help restock. :/ Water-damage pretty much means those books are all gone. Damn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to give you some links today to some news items, none of which are particularly cheerful either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like – &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/mar/19/prince-charles-health-charity-complaint"&gt;Prince Charles health charity accused of vendetta against critic &lt;/a&gt;in the UK BBC news, which involved Edzard Ernst (co-author of the great &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Trick-Treatment-Alternative-Medicine-Trial/dp/0593061292"&gt;Trick or Treatment?: Alternative Medicine on Trial&lt;/a&gt; with Simon Singh):&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The complaint states the trustees of the Prince’s Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH) allowed the foundation’s staff to pursue a public “vendetta” against a prominent critic of the prince’s support for complementary medicines, Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It also suggests the imminent closure of Ernst’s department may be partly down to the charity’s official complaint about him after he publicly attacked its draft guide to complementary medicines as “outrageous and deeply flawed”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=4125546&amp;amp;cid=Opinions_1_220310"&gt;Edzard Ernst gives his side of the story at The Pulse&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My comment was as follows: ‘For far too long has the Prince of Wales been allowed to use his FIH as his private tool for popularizing his strange and antiscientific views on healthcare.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘In the process, public funds have been wasted, the British public were systematically misled and progress was hindered. In my view, the field of complementary medicine would benefit greatly, if the FIH ceased to exist and the funds thus freed were directed towards rigorous research.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how unimpressed I am with the news that in &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/22/2853203.htm"&gt;Malaysia, ABC News reports, ‘&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/22/2853203.htm"&gt;filmmakers can depict homosexuals for the first time in strictly censored Malaysia&lt;/a&gt;, so long as they repent or even go straight in the end, an industry group said’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. I’m going back to my nice dry bed and hug my terrified cats who don’t like the thunder. :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This introduction presents the essays belonging to the JCOM special issue on User-led and peer-to-peer science. It also draws a first map of the main problems we need to investigate when we face this new and emerging phenomenon. Web tools are enacting and facilitating new ways for lay people to interact with scientists or to cooperate with each other, but cultural and political changes are also at play. What happens to expertise, knowledge production and relations between scientific institutions and society when lay people or non-scientists go online and engage in scientific activities? From science blogging and social networks to garage biology and open tools for user-led research, P2P science challenges many assumptions about public participation in scientific knowledge production. And it calls for a radical and perhaps new kind of openness of scientific practices towards society.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29A01/" title=""&gt;Changing the meaning of peer-to-peer? Exploring online comment spaces as sites of negotiated expertise&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study examines the nature of peer-to-peer interactions in public online comment spaces. From a theoretical perspective of boundary-work and expertise, the comments posted in response to three health sciences news articles from a national newspaper are explored to determine whether both scientific and personal expertise are recognized and taken up in discussion. Posts were analysed for both explicit claims to expertise and implicit claims embedded in discourse. The analysis suggests that while both scientific and personal expertise are proffered by commenters, it is scientific expertise that is privileged. Those expressing scientific expertise receive greater recognition of the value of their posts. Contributors seeking to share personal expertise are found to engage in scientisation to position themselves as worthwhile experts. Findings suggest that despite the possibilities afforded by online comments for a broader vision of what peer-to-peer interaction means, this possibility is not realized.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29A03/" title=""&gt;The public production and sharing of medical information. An Australian perspective&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a wealth of medical information now available to the public through various sources that are not necessarily controlled by medical or healthcare professionals. In Australia there has been a strong movement in the health consumer arena of consumer-led sharing and production of medical information and in healthcare decision-making. This has led to empowerment of the public as well as increased knowledge-sharing. There are some successful initiatives and strategies on consumer- and public-led sharing of medical information, including the formation of specialised consumer groups, independent medical information organisations, consumer peer tutoring, and email lists and consumer networking events. With well-organised public initiatives and networks, there tends to be fairly balanced information being shared. However, there needs to be caution about the use of publicly available scientific information to further the agenda of special-interest groups and lobbying groups to advance often biased and unproven opinions or for scaremongering. With the adoption of more accountability of medical research, and the increased public scrutiny of private and public research, the validity and quality of medical information reaching the public is achieving higher standards.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29A04/" title=""&gt;Social network science: pedagogy, dialogue, deliberation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The online world constitutes an ever-expanding store and incubator for scientific information. It is also a social space where forms of creative interaction engender new ways of approaching science. Critically, the web is not only a repository of knowledge but a means with which to experience, interact and even supplement this bank. Social Network Sites are a key feature of such activity. This paper explores the potential for Social Network Sites (SNS) as an innovative pedagogical tool that precipitate the 'incidental learner'. I suggest that these online spaces, characterised by informality, open-access, user input and widespread popularity, offer a potentially indispensable means of furthering the public understanding of science; and significantly one that is rooted in dialogue.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29A05/" title=""&gt;Open science: policy implications for the evolving phenomenon of user-led scientific innovation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;From contributions of astronomy data and DNA sequences to disease treatment research, scientific activity by non-scientists is a real and emergent phenomenon, and raising policy questions. This involvement in science can be understood as an issue of access to publications, code, and data that facilitates public engagement in the research process, thus appropriate policy to support the associated welfare enhancing benefits is essential. Current legal barriers to citizen participation can be alleviated by scientists' use of the "Reproducible Research Standard," thus making the literature, data, and code associated with scientific results accessible. The enterprise of science is undergoing deep and fundamental changes, particularly in how scientists obtain results and share their work: the promise of open research dissemination held by the Internet is gradually being fulfilled by scientists. Contributions to science from beyond the ivory tower are forcing a rethinking of traditional models of knowledge generation, evaluation, and communication. The notion of a scientific "peer" is blurred with the advent of lay contributions to science raising questions regarding the concepts of peer-review and recognition. New collaborative models are emerging around both open scientific software and the generation of scientific discoveries that bear a similarity to open innovation models in other settings. Public engagement in science can be understood as an issue of access to knowledge for public involvement in the research process, facilitated by appropriate policy to support the welfare enhancing benefits deriving from citizen-science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29A06/" title=""&gt;Googling your genes: personal genomics and the discourse of citizen bioscience in the network age&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this essay, I argue that the rise of personal genomics is technologically, economically, and most importantly, discursively tied to the rise of network subjectivity, an imperative of which is an understanding of self as always already a subject in the network. I illustrate how personal genomics takes full advantage of social media technology and network subjectivity to advertise a new way of doing research that emphasizes collaboration between researchers and its members. Sharing one's genetic information is considered to be an act of citizenship, precisely because it is good for the network. Here members are encouraged to think of themselves as dividuals, or nodes, in the network and their actions acquire value based on that imperative. Therefore, citizen bioscience is intricately tied, both in discourse and practices, to the growth of the network in the age of new media.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29C01/" title=""&gt;Special issue on peer-to-peer and user-led science: invited comments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this commentary, we collected three essays from authors coming from different perspectives. They analyse the problem of power, participation and cooperation in projects of production of scientific knowledge held by users or peers: persons who do not belong to the institutionalised scientific community. These contributions are intended to give a more political and critical point of view on the themes developed and analysed in the research articles of this JCOM special issue on Peer-to-peer and user-led science.

&lt;p&gt;Michel Bauwens, Christopher Kelty and Mathieu O'Neil write about different aspects of P2P science. Nevertheless, the three worlds they delve into share the "aggressively active" attitude of the citizens who inhabit them. Those citizens claim to be part of the scientific process, and they use practices as heterogeneous as online peer-production of scientific knowledge, garage biology practiced with a hacker twist, or the crowdsourced creation of an encyclopedia page. All these claims and practices point to a problem in the current distribution of power. The relations between experts and non-experts are challenged by the rise of peer-to-peer science. Furthermore, the horizontal communities which live inside and outside the Net are not frictionless. Within peer-production mechanisms, the balance of power is an important issue which has to be carefully taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29C01/Jcom0901%282010%29C02" title=""&gt;Is there something like a peer to peer science?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How will peer to peer infrastructures, and the underlying intersubjective and ethical relational model that is implied by it, affect scientific practice? Are peer-to-peer forms of cooperation, based on open and free input of voluntary contributors, participatory processes of governance, and universal availability of the output, more productive than centralized alternatives? In this short introduction, Michel Bauwens reviews a number of open and free, participatory and commons oriented practices that are emerging in scientific research and practice, but which ultimately point to a more profound epistemological revolution linked to increased participatory consciousness between the scientist and his human, organic and inorganic research material.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This essay reflects on three figures that can be used to make sense of the changing nature of public participation in the life sciences today: outlaws, hackers and Victorian gentlemen. Occasioned by a symposium held at UCLA (Outlaw Biology: Public Participation in the Age of Big Bio), the essay introduces several different modes of participation (DIY Bio, Bio Art, At home clinical genetics, patient advocacy and others) and makes three points: 1) that public participation is first a problem of legitimacy, not legality or safety; 2) that public participation is itself enabled by and thrives on the infrastructure of mainstream biology; and 3) that we need a new set of concepts (other than inside/outside) for describing the nature of public participation in biological research and innovation today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29C01/Jcom0901%282010%29C04" title=""&gt;Shirky and Sanger, or the costs of crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Online knowledge production sites do not rely on isolated experts but on collaborative processes, on the wisdom of the group or "crowd". Some authors have argued that it is possible to combine traditional or credentialled expertise with collective production; others believe that traditional expertise's focus on correctness has been superseded by the affordances of digital networking, such as re-use and verifiability. This paper examines the costs of two kinds of "crowdsourced" encyclopedic projects: Citizendium, based on the work of credentialled and identified experts, faces a recruitment deficit; in contrast Wikipedia has proved wildly popular, but anti-credentialism and anonymity result in uncertainty, irresponsibility, the development of cliques and the growing importance of pseudo-legal competencies for conflict resolution. Finally the paper reflects on the wider social implications of focusing on what experts are rather than on what they are for.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901%282010%29R01/" title=""&gt;The unsustainable Makers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Makers is the latest novel of the American science fiction writer, blogger and Silicon Valley intellectual Cory Doctorow. Set in the 2010s, the novel describes the possible impact of the present trend towards the migration of modes of production and organization that have emerged online into the sphere of material production. Called New Work, this movement is indebted to a new maker culture that attracts people into a kind of neo-artisan, high tech mode of production. The question is: can a corporate-funded New Work movement be sustainable? Doctorow seems to suggest that a capitalist economy of abundance is unsustainable because it tends to restrict the reach of its value flows to a privileged managerial elite.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/the_new_issue_of_journal_of_sc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/1TfowezCDu0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269262409459"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1762">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/57725bf8cb1f5788</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Hyperactive Agency Detection</title><published>2010-03-22T12:30:01Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T12:30:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1762" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Something does not seem quite right. The most powerful man in the  world, John F. Kennedy, was taken out by a lone nutjob of no previous  consequence? A jet flies into the pentagon and yet the expected debris  is not visible. And why can’t I see stars in the NASA Apollo moon  landing photos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some hidden agent must be at work, conspiring to deceive and carry  out some sinister plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least that is how our brains are hardwired to think, and some of  us more than others. This tendency has been termed the “hyperactive (or  hypersensitive) agency detection device” -  HADD – &lt;a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~theo0038/pdf%20files/HADD.rtf.pdf"&gt;coined  by Justin Barrett&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding that HADD is an intrinsic part of  human nature is part of the core knowledge base of the skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a neurologist and a skeptic I am particularly interested in how  brain function relates to human intellectual strengths and weaknesses  and how knowledge of such helps us to avoid common mental pitfalls. In  other words, knowledge of how the human brain works helps us think  better – to be more skeptical and avoid error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;Psychologists and  neuroscientists in recent years have demonstrated that our brains are  hardwired to distinguish things in our environment that are alive from  those that are not alive. But “being alive” (from a psychological point  of view) is not about biology, but agency – something that can act in  the world, that has its own will and can cause things to happen. Sure,  this is a property of living things, but that’s not how our brain sort  things out. We can perceive agency in non-living things if they are  acting as if they are agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=768"&gt;This is  reflected even in our visual system&lt;/a&gt;, which separates out visual  information into different streams according to the type of information.  One division is between information about actions and information about  objects. The object stream is also divided into brain regions that deal  with inanimate objects and other regions that deal with living things or  animate objects. So on a fundamental level our brains treat agents  different than objects – from the moment we see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brucemhood.wordpress.com/about-supersense/"&gt;Bruce Hood,  author of Supersense&lt;/a&gt;, goes over in his book the psychological  studies that have documented and described the human tendency to think  of objects differently than agents. We imbue agents with an essence – a  unique living force, even while infants. Objects are just generic  things, totally interchangeable. While agents have their own unique  essence. Interestingly, children can come to view a favorite toy (a  stuffed animal, for example) with the properties of an agent and will  treat it like a living thing. This reinforces the notion that the  distinction we make is not between living and non-living so much as  agent vs object. This  likely also explains why we can watch a cartoon  and react emotionally to the characters as if they were real – they are  not living, but we see them as agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barrett, HADD works in part by detecting any  movement that is non-inertial – something which seems to be moving of  its own volition. We then assume it is acting with agency and react  accordingly. This likely provided an evolutionary advantage – it is  better to assume the rustling in the bushes was not the wind but a  hungry tiger. So we are descended from hominids who were more paranoid  and had hyperactive agency detection, because they were less likely to  be eaten by predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can extrapolate from “non-inertial  movement”, or movement that cannot be easily explained as a passive  reaction to natural forces, to more and more complex “actions.” HADD  detects more than movement, it can detect a pattern in otherwise  unrelated events, details that defy easy explanation, or consequences  that seem out of proportion to the alleged causes. When HADD is  triggered we tend to see a hidden agent working behind the scenes,  making events unfold the way they do, and perhaps even deliberately  hiding its own tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When HADD is triggered and we think we see  the hidden agent, it speaks to us in a very primal way. For some people  the perception of hidden agency becomes overwhelming, dominating all  other thought processes. We know these people as conspiracy theorists.  But there is a little conspiracy theorist inside each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies  have also demonstrated that HADD is more likely to be triggered when a  stimulus is ambiguous – therefore it tends to be our default assumption –  an object is an agent until we are sure it’s just an object. Also, in  situations where we have less control our HADD becomes more active  still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrett and others have speculated that HADD is important  to the development of religion – where God is the ultimate invisible  agent. So far this hypothesis has not been significantly researched, but  it does seem reasonable. Seeing natural or random events as the will of  an agent is HADD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HADD also leads to superstition – thinking  that there is a cause and effect between unconnected events. The  underlying assumption of superstitions is that things happen for a  reason (a vague ill-defined reason, but a sense that there is a hidden  agency at work). I think it is liberating to understand that rather (as  was most elegantly stated on a bumper sticker) “shit happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism,  in many ways, is a filter on HADD. First we have to recognize that our  brains are not perfect perceivers and processors of information. There  are specific and myriad ways in which the human brain is biased and  flawed. Science and skepticism are methods for correcting or filtering  out those biases. Skeptics ask themselves – is it really true. We see  many patterns, but only some of those patterns represent underlying  reality. We need a process to sort out which ones are real – that is  science and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269262353680"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=7341">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b5b2509717263b5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="skepticism"/><title type="html">Hyperactive Agency Detection</title><published>2010-03-22T12:28:22Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T12:28:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2010/03/22/hyperactive-agency-detection/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Something does not seem quite right.

&lt;p&gt;Some hidden agent must be at work, conspiring to deceive and carry out some sinister plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least that is how our brains are hardwired to think, and some of us more than others. This tendency has been termed the “hyperactive (or hypersensitive) agency detection device” -  HADD – &lt;a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~theo0038/pdf%20files/HADD.rtf.pdf"&gt;coined by Justin Barrett&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding that HADD is an intrinsic part of human nature is part of the core knowledge base of the skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a neurologist and a skeptic I am particularly interested in how brain function relates to human intellectual strengths and weaknesses and how knowledge of such helps us to avoid common mental pitfalls. In other words, knowledge of how the human brain works helps us think better – to be more skeptical and avoid error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Psychologists and neuroscientists in recent years have demonstrated that our brains are hardwired to distinguish things in our environment that are alive from those that are not alive. But “being alive” (from a psychological point of view) is not about biology, but agency – something that can act in the world, that has its own will and can cause things to happen. Sure, this is a property of living things, but that’s not how our brain sort things out. We can perceive agency in non-living things if they are acting as if they are agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=768"&gt;This is reflected even in our visual system&lt;/a&gt;, which separates out visual information into different streams according to the type of information. One division is between information about actions and information about objects. The object stream is also divided into brain regions that deal with inanimate objects and other regions that deal with living things or animate objects. So on a fundamental level our brains treat agents different than objects – from the moment we see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brucemhood.wordpress.com/about-supersense/"&gt;Bruce Hood, author of Supersense&lt;/a&gt;, goes over in his book the psychological studies that have documented and described the human tendency to think of objects differently than agents. We imbue agents with an essence – a unique living force, even while infants. Objects are just generic things, totally interchangeable. While agents have their own unique essence. Interestingly, children can come to view a favorite toy (a stuffed animal, for example) with the properties of an agent and will treat it like a living thing. This reinforces the notion that the distinction we make is not between living and non-living so much as agent vs object. This  likely also explains why we can watch a cartoon and react emotionally to the characters as if they were real – they are not living, but we see them as agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Barrett, HADD works in part by detecting any movement that is non-inertial – something which seems to be moving of its own volition. We then assume it is acting with agency and react accordingly. This likely provided an evolutionary advantage – it is better to assume the rustling in the bushes was not the wind but a hungry tiger. So we are descended from hominids who were more paranoid and had hyperactive agency detection, because they were less likely to be eaten by predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can extrapolate from “non-inertial movement”, or movement that cannot be easily explained as a passive reaction to natural forces, to more and more complex “actions.” HADD detects more than movement, it can detect a pattern in otherwise unrelated events, details that defy easy explanation, or consequences that seem out of proportion to the alleged causes. When HADD is triggered we tend to see a hidden agent working behind the scenes, making events unfold the way they do, and perhaps even deliberately hiding its own tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When HADD is triggered and we think we see the hidden agent, it speaks to us in a very primal way. For some people the perception of hidden agency becomes overwhelming, dominating all other thought processes. We know these people as conspiracy theorists. But there is a little conspiracy theorist inside each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have also demonstrated that HADD is more likely to be triggered when a stimulus is ambiguous – therefore it tends to be our default assumption – an object is an agent until we are sure it’s just an object. Also, in situations where we have less control our HADD becomes more active still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrett and others have speculated that HADD is important to the development of religion – where God is the ultimate invisible agent. So far this hypothesis has not been significantly researched, but it does seem reasonable. Seeing natural or random events as the will of an agent is HADD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HADD also leads to superstition – thinking that there is a cause and effect between unconnected events. The underlying assumption of superstitions is that things happen for a reason (a vague ill-defined reason, but a sense that there is a hidden agency at work). I think it is liberating to understand that rather (as was most elegantly stated on a bumper sticker) “shit happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepticism, in many ways, is a filter on HADD. First we have to recognize that our brains are not perfect perceivers and processors of information. There are specific and myriad ways in which the human brain is biased and flawed. Science and skepticism are methods for correcting or filtering out those biases. Skeptics ask themselves – is it really true. We see many patterns, but only some of those patterns represent underlying reality. We need a process to sort out which ones are real – that is science and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269262209898"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/03/gorgeous_cover_designs_for_jul.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e747270558512555</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Gorgeous cover designs for Jules Verne books</title><published>2010-03-22T11:46:41Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T11:46:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2010/03/gorgeous_cover_designs_for_jul.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jimtierneyart.com/"&gt;Jim Tierney&lt;/a&gt; designed a beautiful set of covers for some of Jules Verne's most famous works.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm a big Verne fan, but a chance to re-design any classic book is always exciting.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, a political victory for President Obama, and a triumph for Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker. But it is also a victory for America’s soul. In the end, a vicious, unprincipled fear offensive failed to block reform. This time, fear struck out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her thesis has been not only that modern evolutionary biology is rotten to the core, but that we evolutionists all know it and are desperately trying to cover up a crumbling paradigm.  Her interviews with people like Stuart Pivar and my old boss, Dick Lewontin, are really funny: Mazur desperately wants them all to admit that evolutionary biology is bankrupt, no matter what they think.  Instead of finding out what they think, she presses and presses them to agree with her. It seems that most of these hilarious interviews have disappeared from the internet, but you can get a taste of them &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wk2FfQQ_DmsC&amp;amp;pg=PA71&amp;amp;lpg=PA71&amp;amp;dq=Richard+Lewontin+Suzan+Mazur&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=K9ZKiaVEVW&amp;amp;sig=hgKU1_j6jxjCXyKzC5vPFR2IZBw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=5F6nS73YBNKztgecxemBAw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Richard%20Lewontin%20Suzan%20Mazur&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0911/S00297.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, of course she quite likes &lt;em&gt;What Darwin Got Wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but claims that it doesn’t go far enough in exposing the corrupt evolution industry.  In other words, &lt;em&gt;it wasn’t looney enough&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no mention of right or wrong fresher perspectives like that of Stuart Pivar, whose toroidal model Piattelli-Palmarini found initially interesting, or of geologist Mark McMenamin, who thinks the famous Dolf Seilacher Namibian tongue fossil is a flattened morphogenetic torus, a “paleotorus”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these scientists have discussed with me at length in online interviews various mechanisms of evolution — particularly, Stuart Newman — saltational mechanisms of embryonic development, chemical oscillation, etc. Scott Gilbert, who gets no attention in &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Darwin&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Got&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wrong&lt;/em&gt;, referred to “five main mechanisms for the generation of anatomical diversity” in our Q&amp;amp;A last year: heterochrony, heterotopy, heterometry, heterotypy, heterocyberny. Almost every scientist I’ve spoken to, however, does admit that the PROCESS of evolution remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to see that the Italian edition of the Fodor, Piattelli-Palmarini book references my coverage (“la saggista e giornalista”) of the Altenberg 16 saga and (“fieramente indipendente”) &lt;em&gt;Scoop Media&lt;/em&gt;. Lynn Margulis too is acknowledged in Italian via our phone interview from Oxford, in which she recounts how she and Francisco Ayala pronounced neo-Darwinism dead one night at a meeting with Whiteheadian philosopher John Cobb. Philosopher and zoologist Stan Salthe with his “poisonous” view that Darwin’s theory is “unexplainable caprice from top to bottom” is cited in Italian as well, and rightly so, because Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini agree to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . What happens next as the neo-Darwinist house of cards collapses and the turnaround in evolutionary science proceeds with the circle drawn wider and wider to include more of the public? “The Jerry Coyne crowd will just fade into the background,” one evolutionary scientist whispered to me. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice!  I’m sad that she doesn’t identify that “evolutionary scientist,” who apparenently had to “whisper” out of fear that our evil, hornéd cabal would bring down the wrath of Darwin. But I’m flattered and honored to have the crowd of &lt;em&gt;sane&lt;/em&gt; evolutionary biologists named after me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazur is a real hoot, and I really don’t worry about her attacks on evolution because, so far as I can determine, nobody takes her seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009769" title=""&gt;Laetoli Footprints Preserve Earliest Direct Evidence of Human-Like Bipedal Biomechanics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Debates over the evolution of hominin bipedalism, a defining human characteristic, revolve around whether early bipeds walked more like humans, with energetically efficient extended hind limbs, or more like apes with flexed hind limbs. The 3.6 million year old hominin footprints at Laetoli, Tanzania represent the earliest direct evidence of hominin bipedalism. Determining the kinematics of Laetoli hominins will allow us to understand whether selection acted to decrease energy costs of bipedalism by 3.6 Ma. Using an experimental design, we show that the Laetoli hominins walked with weight transfer most similar to the economical extended limb bipedalism of humans. Humans walked through a sand trackway using both extended limb bipedalism, and more flexed limb bipedalism. Footprint morphology from extended limb trials matches weight distribution patterns found in the Laetoli footprints. These results provide us with the earliest direct evidence of kinematically human-like bipedalism currently known, and show that extended limb bipedalism evolved long before the appearance of the genus Homo. Since extended-limb bipedalism is more energetically economical than ape-like bipedalism, energy expenditure was likely an important selection pressure on hominin bipeds by 3.6 Ma.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009654" title=""&gt;Embryonic, Larval, and Juvenile Development of the Sea Biscuit Clypeaster subdepressus (Echinodermata: Clypeasteroida)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sea biscuits and sand dollars diverged from other irregular echinoids approximately 55 million years ago and rapidly dispersed to oceans worldwide. A series of morphological changes were associated with the occupation of sand beds such as flattening of the body, shortening of primary spines, multiplication of podia, and retention of the lantern of Aristotle into adulthood. To investigate the developmental basis of such morphological changes we documented the ontogeny of Clypeaster subdepressus. We obtained gametes from adult specimens by KCl injection and raised the embryos at 26C. Ciliated blastulae hatched 7.5 h after sperm entry. During gastrulation the archenteron elongated continuously while ectodermal red-pigmented cells migrated synchronously to the apical plate. Pluteus larvae began to feed in 3 d and were 20 d old at metamorphosis; starved larvae died 17 d after fertilization. Postlarval juveniles had neither mouth nor anus nor plates on the aboral side, except for the remnants of larval spicules, but their bilateral symmetry became evident after the resorption of larval tissues. Ossicles of the lantern were present and organized in 5 groups. Each group had 1 tooth, 2 demipyramids, and 2 epiphyses with a rotula in between. Early appendages consisted of 15 spines, 15 podia (2 types), and 5 sphaeridia. Podial types were distributed in accordance to Lovén's rule and the first podium of each ambulacrum was not encircled by the skeleton. Seven days after metamorphosis juveniles began to feed by rasping sand grains with the lantern. Juveniles survived in laboratory cultures for 9 months and died with wide, a single open sphaeridium per ambulacrum, aboral anus, and no differentiated food grooves or petaloids. Tracking the morphogenesis of early juveniles is a necessary step to elucidate the developmental mechanisms of echinoid growth and important groundwork to clarify homologies between irregular urchins.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009790" title=""&gt;Emotion Separation Is Completed Early and It Depends on Visual Field Presentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now apparent that the visual system reacts to stimuli very fast, with many brain areas activated within 100 ms. It is, however, unclear how much detail is extracted about stimulus properties in the early stages of visual processing. Here, using magnetoencephalography we show that the visual system separates different facial expressions of emotion well within 100 ms after image onset, and that this separation is processed differently depending on where in the visual field the stimulus is presented. Seven right-handed males participated in a face affect recognition experiment in which they viewed happy, fearful and neutral faces. Blocks of images were shown either at the center or in one of the four quadrants of the visual field. For centrally presented faces, the emotions were separated fast, first in the right superior temporal sulcus (STS; 35-48 ms), followed by the right amygdala (57-64 ms) and medial pre-frontal cortex (83-96 ms). For faces presented in the periphery, the emotions were separated first in the ipsilateral amygdala and contralateral STS. We conclude that amygdala and STS likely play a different role in early visual processing, recruiting distinct neural networks for action: the amygdala alerts sub-cortical centers for appropriate autonomic system response for fight or flight decisions, while the STS facilitates more cognitive appraisal of situations and links appropriate cortical sites together. It is then likely that different problems may arise when either network fails to initiate or function properly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009675" title=""&gt;Effect of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation on Gait in Parkinsonian Patients with and without Freezing of Gait&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) rises in prevalence when the effect of medications decays. It is known that auditory rhythmic stimulation improves gait in patients without FOG (PD-FOG), but its putative effect on patients with FOG (PD+FOG) at the end of dose has not been evaluated yet. This work evaluates the effect of auditory rhythmic stimulation on PD+FOG at the end of dose. 10 PD+FOG and 9 PD-FOG patients both at the end of dose periods, and 10 healthy controls were asked to perform several walking tasks. Tasks were performed in the presence and absence of auditory sensory stimulation. All PD+FOG suffered FOG during the task. The presence of auditory rhythmic stimulation (10% above preferred walking cadence) led PD+FOG to significantly reduce FOG. Velocity and cadence were increased, and turn time reduced in all groups. We conclude that auditory stimulation at the frequency proposed may be useful to avoid freezing episodes in PD+FOG.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009783" title=""&gt;Circadian Control of Mouse Heart Rate and Blood Pressure by the Suprachiasmatic Nuclei: Behavioral Effects Are More Significant than Direct Outputs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Diurnal variations in the incidence of events such as heart attack and stroke suggest a role for circadian rhythms in the etiology of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock on cardiovascular function. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and locomotor activity (LA) were measured in circadian mutant (Vipr2−/−) mice and wild type littermates, using implanted radio-telemetry devices. Sleep and wakefulness were studied in similar mice implanted with electroencephalograph (EEG) electrodes. There was less diurnal variation in the frequency and duration of bouts of rest/activity and sleep/wake in Vipr2−/− mice than in wild type (WT) and short "ultradian" episodes of arousal were more prominent, especially in constant conditions (DD). Activity was an important determinant of circadian variation in BP and HR in animals of both genotypes; altered timing of episodes of activity and rest (as well as sleep and wakefulness) across the day accounted for most of the difference between Vipr2−/− mice and WT. However, there was also a modest circadian rhythm of resting HR and BP that was independent of LA. If appropriate methods of analysis are used that take into account sleep and locomotor activity level, mice are a good model for understanding the contribution of circadian timing to cardiovascular function. Future studies of the influence of sleep and wakefulness on cardiovascular physiology may help to explain accumulating evidence linking disrupted sleep with cardiovascular disease in man.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009810" title=""&gt;Bias Due to Changes in Specified Outcomes during the Systematic Review Process&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adding, omitting or changing outcomes after a systematic review protocol is published can result in bias because it increases the potential for unacknowledged or post hoc revisions of the planned analyses. The main objective of this study was to look for discrepancies between primary outcomes listed in protocols and in the subsequent completed reviews published on the Cochrane Library. A secondary objective was to quantify the risk of bias in a set of meta-analyses where discrepancies between outcome specifications in protocols and reviews were found. New reviews from three consecutive issues of the Cochrane Library were assessed. For each review, the primary outcome(s) listed in the review protocol and the review itself were identified and review authors were contacted to provide reasons for any discrepancies. Over a fifth (64/288, 22%) of protocol/review pairings were found to contain a discrepancy in at least one outcome measure, of which 48 (75%) were attributable to changes in the primary outcome measure. Where lead authors could recall a reason for the discrepancy in the primary outcome, there was found to be potential bias in nearly a third (8/28, 29%) of these reviews, with changes being made after knowledge of the results from individual trials. Only 4(6%) of the 64 reviews with an outcome discrepancy described the reason for the change in the review, with no acknowledgment of the change in any of the eight reviews containing potentially biased discrepancies. Outcomes that were promoted in the review were more likely to be significant than if there was no discrepancy (relative risk 1.66 95% CI (1.10, 2.49), p = 0.02). In a review, making changes after seeing the results for included studies can lead to biased and misleading interpretation if the importance of the outcome (primary or secondary) is changed on the basis of those results. Our assessment showed that reasons for discrepancies with the protocol are not reported in the review, demonstrating an under-recognition of the problem. Complete transparency in the reporting of changes in outcome specification is vital; systematic reviewers should ensure that any legitimate changes to outcome specification are reported with reason in the review.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_263.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/l3xQmCBbvW0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269259608237"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/mobile_phone_companies_tobacco_companies.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f5890dfa978a669</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Mobile phone companies = tobacco companies?

&lt;p&gt;Every so often, it seems, the media has to recycle certain scare stories based on little or no science. Be it vaccines and whether they cause autism or not (the don't) or various environmental exposures supposedly linked to various cancers or other diseases in which the science is far more complex or tentative than represented, convincing people that some common thing to which we are routinely exposed is going to kill them seldom fails to bring in the readers. One of the favorite targets of this is the ubiquitous cell phone, and there have been two hunks o' burnin' stupid that I've seen about cell phones and their alleged link to cancer in the media. One was published yesterday in that famous medical journal &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;. Written by Dr. Ranit Mishori, a family practitioner who seems to like writing sensationalistic articles, it's entitled &lt;a href="http://www.parade.com/health/2010/03/21-how-safe-are-cellphones.html"&gt;How Safe Are Cell Phones?&lt;/a&gt;, and it rehashes the usual arguments. While admitting that cell phone radiation is too weak to break chemical bonds in DNA and that numerous studies have failed to find a link between cell phone use and brain cancer, not to mention that the incidence of brain cancer does not appear to be rising, Dr. Mishori nonetheless writes as though there is serious science showing a profound risk. Fortunately, Decrepit Old Fool &lt;a href="http://www.decrepitoldfool.com/index.php/weblog/stupidity_on_parade_mar10/"&gt;demolishes Dr. Mishori's article quite handily&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the second bit of stupidity to me. I can't resist quoting one passage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Mishori admits that cell phones make the wrong kind of radiation to break chemical bonds, and that studies have found no link between cell phone use and brain cancer.  She admits there's been no change in incidence of brain cancer.  But still she says "more studies are needed". 

&lt;p&gt;While they're at it, they should study whether exposure to any temperature above absolute zero causes cancer too, because infrared is above microwave on the electromagnetic spectrum.  Light bulbs and space heaters could be our doom.  A fireplace?  Forget it - more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that matter, avoid all visible light!  Best to cover yourself entirely in aluminum foil and breathe through a bendy-straw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh. That's some pretty good insolence.&lt;/p&gt;

Keene&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rita R. Handrich&lt;/strong&gt; write about how lawyers should act when they have atheist clients and when an atheist may be on the jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offer a few tips to lawyers, most of which make sense if the only purpose is to win the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If your client isn’t ‘out’ as an atheist, it is better for you to keep it that way. There is no point in complicating his or her identity as a litigant. On the other hand, if your client has ever publicly acknowledged being an atheist, assume it’s on the internet and that jurors may learn about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also suggest a lawyer may not want a hard-core atheist on a jury:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can fairly assume that anyone who publicly identifies him- or herself as atheist is unusually opinionated and might be too unpredictable to have on your jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see this in pre-trial research with anyone who identifies as extreme (e.g., very liberal or very conservative). They are often not people we want on juries because we simply cannot predict which direction they will go on a particular case, and they tend to have a polarizing affect on the jury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want atheists on your particular jury? It depends. As we mentioned earlier, you probably don’t want a militant atheist — like most militants they are likely too unpredictable and a potentially polarizing force in the deliberation room… Of course, if you want a contentious deliberation or a hung jury you may choose to inject a militant atheist, but we aren’t getting into that for this article.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinionated?  Definitely.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unpredictable?  I doubt it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, I think you could predict fairly accurately where most atheists would stand on a number of issues.  I know this is playing to the stereotype, but If I were a lawyer, I would be &lt;em&gt;thrilled&lt;/em&gt; to know whether or not a potential juror was an atheist — it would provide me with an easy way to figure out if I wanted the person on the jury or not.  Atheists are a lot of things, but a wild card on a number of issues is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the notion that we “tend to have a polarizing affect on the jury”?  Again, that knowledge of a potential juror’s atheism would only help out.  If I thought an atheist would side in favor of my client, I would want that person on the jury — partly because atheists know how to make their case to other people in a logical manner and could be persuasive in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keene and Handrich also provide a quick reference guide to lawyers who may have to deal with atheist (or very religious) jurors.  Note that they use the word “we” in a royal sense — studies show Americans are distrustful of atheists and have many biases against us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.astcweb.org/public/publication/article.cfm/1/22/2/America-Hates-Atheists"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/AtheistLaw.png" alt="" title="AtheistLaw" width="573" height="443"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their advice for lawyers is mostly sound and they do a decent job of educating them about what we do have in common and how we think.  If their piece rubs you the wrong way, remember that their job is to be strategic, not to appeal to or fight against atheists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been on a jury, but I wonder if any of you have experiences being on one and whether religion played any role during deliberations.&lt;br&gt;

I thank him for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2197#comment-61667"&gt;responding&lt;/a&gt; to the discussion, and for confirming that it was &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; about him pressing the buttons in the wrong order.  The reason his fine journal (the &lt;i&gt;Australian Journal of Linguistics&lt;/i&gt;) sent me a message sequence I found annoying and presumptuous is the design of the stupid ScholarOne Manuscript software.  Let me explain a little more about the nature of my life (perhaps my experiences will find an echo in yours), the part that involves those arbitrary strings of letters and digits we are all supposed to carry around in our heads like mental sets of keys.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have to keep a secret laptop file (it had &lt;b&gt;better&lt;/b&gt; be secret — I can only hope I have hidden it well enough, since laptops do get stolen) containing more than a hundred triples consisting of URL, login name, and password or PIN that I have been issued with in pursuance of my many duties.  Many of these accounts are for duties absolutely required of me in my university roles.  Often there is no option to change either the login name or the password.  (One of these also involved a complicated and entirely numerical login name.  I was expected to use it the other day to fix a problem with student records entry that arose in 2005 at a university that I left in 2007.  Apparently people expect you to keep in perpetuity these records of the unmemorizable passwords they give you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply hate being issued with new account names and passwords, to add to this burden.  Yet these days a new one is obligatory for every association membership, email service, records database, blogger identity, banking arrangement, credit card, cellphone service, online purchase, loyalty program, travel agent, grant application, computer account, encryption system, or reviewing chore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of them, I know, it is true that I would in principle be able to pick my way slowly through their &amp;quot;Edit my profile&amp;quot; page and figure out how to change the password to a standard one (not that they recommend it: security experts say you should have different passwords for every account!); but with over a hundred to work through, it would be hours of work, and I would still need to keep records of which ones I had changed so far, and what I had changed them to.  There are widely differing rules regarding password composition: some (with no financial interest to protect) are ridiculously slack, and would accept &amp;quot;abcdef&amp;quot; (I even encountered one idiot organization that sent me an email confirming what password I&amp;#39;d chosen, and repeated it in their message, in plain text!), but others insist on something like &amp;quot;aQz&amp;amp;g9#B&amp;quot;, with at least 8 characters and including case distinctions and non-alphabetics and embedded numerals, and repeatedly reject passwords until they get one they consider properly secure.  I haven&amp;#39;t got the five minutes to fiddle around with each such account and choose which memorized password to try and make it accept.  I just hide the passwords in a file and look them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not optimal, and I want to minimize the problem. So one thing I want to insist on is that &lt;b&gt;no new accounts are set up for me without my permission&lt;/b&gt;.  The ScholarOne/ManuscriptCentral software violates that tenet, and it then spams me to tell me it has done so!  I find it infuriating.  But the editor, I now learn, has no power to use the software without it behaving in this way.  Thomson Reuters is to blame for what is apparently an uncustomizable piece of garbageware that editors everywhere are increasingly taking up in order to ease the intolerable burdens of their virtually unpaid work.  But it is not the fault of the hard-working editors. I sympathize with Keith, and with others like him all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

That&amp;#39;s according to a new study by Catherine Glenn and David Klonsky that suggests it is those self-harmers who have more serious psychological problems who are more likely to say the sight of blood is important.There are plenty of anecdotal reports hinting at the importance of the sight and taste of blood to self-harmers, as well as references in popular music. &amp;#39;Yeah you bleed just to know you&amp;#39;re alive,&amp;#39; sing the Goo Goo dolls in Iris. &amp;#39;I think it&amp;#39;s time to bleed I&amp;#39;m gonna cut myself and Watch the blood hit the ground,&amp;#39; sings Korn on Right Now. However, this is the first systematic investigation on the topic. Glenn and Klonsky recruited 64 self-harmers from a mass screening of 1,100 new psychology students. With an average age of 19, and 82 per cent being female, the students answered questions about their self-harming and other psychological problems and specifically reported on the importance of the sight of blood.Just over half the participants said that it was important to see blood when they self-harmed, with the most common explanation being that it helps relieve tension and induces calmness. Other explanations were that it &amp;#39;makes me feel real&amp;#39; and shows that &amp;#39;I did it right/deep enough&amp;#39;. The participants who said blood was important didn&amp;#39;t differ in terms of age and gender from those who said it wasn&amp;#39;t. However, the blood-important group reported cutting themselves far more often (a median of 30 times compared with 4 times) and they were more likely to say they self-harmed as a way of regulating their own emotions. The blood-important group also reported more symptoms consistent with bulimia nervosa and borderline personality disorder.&amp;#39;Overall, these results suggest that self-injurers who report it is important to see blood are a more clinically severe group of skin-cutters,&amp;#39; the researchers said. &amp;#39;Therefore, a desire to see blood during non-suicidal self-injury may represent a marker for increased psychopathology.&amp;#39;Glenn and Klonsky said more research was needed to find out why the sight of blood has the significance it does for some people who self-harm. However, they surmised that the sight of one&amp;#39;s own blood could, after an initial rise in heart-rate, lead to a rebound effect characterised by reduced heart-rate and feelings of calmness._________________________________Glenn, C., &amp;amp; Klonsky, E.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Researchers in Manchester and experts in Sweden have developed a blood test which is much more accurate than current testing methods and have found that peanut allergies have probably been overestimated.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The test only detects antibodies to a very specific part of the peanut which triggers the allergic reactions, which in severe cases can be fatal.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Current tests pick up antibodies to much more of the peanut, most of which are irrelevant to the development of allergies, giving large numbers of false positive results.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In controlled conditions scientists at University Hospital South Manchester the University of Manchester gave 1,000 children cookies with or without peanuts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It was found that 80 per cent of the children who were previously thought to have an allergy test did not suffer a reaction to the peanuts. Most of them had hay fever and were in fact allergic to grass or tree pollen.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The blood test which detect antibodies to the peanut protein RH2 was accurate in 97 per cent of cases.

But it will definitely improve the lives of some people, so for now I’m taking tonight to naively celebrate the fact that it’s gotten this far. &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/ynews_ts1290"&gt;It only passed passed by 220 to 211, but it passed&lt;/a&gt;. So now we can finally start the real work. But I don’t want to let the politics of this issue distract from what this all means objectively. So &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/03/with_or_without_health_care_re.php"&gt;here’s PalMD’s take on health care reform from before it passed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other disappointment regarding this victory though is that &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/10/limbaugh-im-not-moving-to_n_492976.html"&gt;Rush Limbaugh isn’t leaving the country as he promised&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on his radio show, the conservative host clarified &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/09/limbaugh-ill-leave-us-if_n_491536.html"&gt;his earlier statement&lt;/a&gt; by saying that he will just  travel to Costa Rica to receive private medical treatment if reform is  passed, not move there permanently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go. Undeniable proof that Rush is a lying blowhard who lacks the courage to stand behind his own empty rhetoric and bravado.&lt;/p&gt;

Handley and the anti-vaccine movement: Gloating over the decline in confidence in vaccines among parents</title><published>2010-03-22T07:00:22Z</published><updated>2010-03-22T07:00:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4259" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the key talking points of the anti-vaccine movement is to repeat the claim, “&lt;a href="http://autismspectrum.wordpress.com/2008/08/08/pro-safe-vaccine-not-anti-vaccine-there-is-a-difference/"&gt;I’m not ‘anti-vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.’” Indeed, one of Jenny McCarthy’s favorite refrains has been “I’m not ‘anti-vaccine.’ I’m pro-safe vaccine,” or “I’m ‘anti-toxin.’” In doing so, the anti-vaccine movement tries very hard to paint itself as being made up of defenders of vaccine safety, as if the &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), the &lt;a href="http://www.aap.org"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; (AAP), and all the regulatory agencies don’t support safe vaccines. Many are the times that we have seen examples of this particular denial, both &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=361"&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/fire_marshall_bill_discusses_vaccines.php"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. For which specific anti-vaccine activists this is self-deception, delusion, or outright lie is a complicated question, but one thing that is clear to me is that the very existence of this talking point demonstrates that, at least for now, being anti-vaccine is still viewed unfavorably by the vast majority of people. If it were not, there would be no need for vaccine conspiracy theorists to use this particular line over and over again. Also, if the rhetoric from the anti-vaccine movement didn’t demonize vaccines so viciously as the One True Cause of autism, asthma, and a variety of other conditions, diseases, and disorders, leaders of the anti-vaccine movement wouldn’t be so anxious to assure us at every turn that, really and truly, they aren’t “anti-vaccine.” Oh, no, not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for them, their rhetoric and activities betray them.  For one thing, the anti-vaccine movement is not monolithic. There are indeed anti-vaccine zealots who are not afraid to admit that they are against vaccines. Many of them showed up to Jenny McCarthy’s &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=139"&gt;Green Our Vaccines&lt;/a&gt; march on Washington two years ago with signs bearing slogans such as “Danger: Child Vaccine (Toxic Waste)”; “We found the weapons of mass destruction”; “Stop poisoning our children”; and, of course, “No forced vaccination! Not in America!” In the run-up to that march, I lurked on several anti-vaccine discussion forums, and I saw first hand how the organizers of the march were trying to keep people with these signs in line and less visible, not so much because they don’t agree with them but because they promoted the “wrong” message. In this, they remind me of political parties trying to rein in their most radical elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among these groups, &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; has supplanted the former most influential anti-vaccine group, the &lt;a href="http://www.nvic.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Vaccine Information Center&lt;/a&gt; (NVIC). It has achieved this largely through somehow attracting a scientifically ignorant washed-up model, actress, and comedienne named Jenny McCarthy who, most recently before having a son diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum had been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_generation_woo.php"&gt;promoting “Indigo Child” woo&lt;/a&gt; on her &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061203045246/www.indigomoms.com/index2.html"&gt;IndigoMoms.com&lt;/a&gt; website, complete with a “&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061019001439/http://indigomoms.com/serv_prayer.html"&gt;quantum prayer wheel&lt;/a&gt;” invented by William Nelson, inventor of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/your_friday_dose_of_woo_miraculous_quest_1.php"&gt;quackalicious EPFX-SCIO&lt;/a&gt;. Back in 2007, just prior to the release of her first autism book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Louder-Than-Words-Mothers-Journey/dp/0525950117"&gt;Louder Than Words: A Mothers’ Journey in Healing Autism&lt;/a&gt;, McCarthy’s “indigo” website disappeared from the web in a futile attempt to send it down the memory hole, but thankfully &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org"&gt;The Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt; knows all. In any case, thanks to Jenny McCarthy and, at least as much to her boyfriend, the massively more famous Jim Carrey, Generation Rescue has been tranformed from an ignored fringe anti-vaccine group to a famous and influential fringe anti-vaccine group with all sorts of ins among the Hollywood elite, just as it’s been tranformed from just Generation Rescue to &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey’s Autism Organization – Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its increasing fame and influence notwithstanding, Generation Rescue has been playing the “pro-safe vaccine” game for at least five years now. Indeed, J.B. Handley himself, founder of Generation Rescue, &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/10/wired-magazine-and-amy-wallace-drink-paul-offits-kool-aid.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;wrote just last year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have vaccinated my children. I encourage others to vaccinate. But when I question vaccine safety, or rather the lack thereof, I’m called “anti-vax” by people like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me, how am I anti-vaccine? How am I endangering other people by encouraging them to read up on vaccine injuries. How am I endangering them by giving them as much information as possible in the hopes that their children will not have the same reaction as my son?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in the five years since I first learned of J.B. Handley, during which time I’ve been following his exploits, I have never once heard him say or seen him write anything that encouraged parents to vaccinate, that expressed anything other than regret or anger at having vaccinated his children and, apparently in his view, caused their autism, or that said anything good about vaccines at all. Quite the contrary, in fact. Last year, for example, J.B. Handley began April, which is Autism Awareness Month, by releasing a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=445"&gt;truly incompetent attempt at a “study”&lt;/a&gt; and then launching Generation Rescue’s deceptive &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=451"&gt;Fourteen Studies&lt;/a&gt; website. All the while, I have seen J.B. paint himself as a guardian or watchdog of vaccine safety time and time again, while using familiar denialist tactics of sowing fear and doubt; misinterpreting, cherrypicking, or misrepresenting existing science; highlighting bogus science like that of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1989"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=503"&gt;Mark and David Geier&lt;/a&gt;; and demonizing his opponents, the last of which he is particularly talented at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent with this, it would appear that J.B has finally let his “I’m not anti-vaccine” mask drop. Last week, Handley laid down an unusually candid bit of his typical &lt;em&gt;braggadocio&lt;/em&gt; about a &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-1962v1"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt; about parental attitudes towards vaccination. Tellingly, he entitled it &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/tinderbox-us-vaccine-fears-up-700-in-7-years.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tinderbox: U.S. Vaccine Fears up 700% in 7 years&lt;/a&gt;, in which he gloated about having been responsible for the increasing mistrust of vaccines among parents. Since Handley prominently mentions yours truly, I felt that a bit of a friendly rejoinder was in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.B. Handley starts off his post by boasting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than a half-dozen full-time activists, annual budgets of six figures or less, and umpteen thousand courageous, undaunted, and selfless volunteer parents, our community, held together with duct tape and bailing wire, is in the early to middle stages of bringing the U.S. vaccine program to its knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue the “Star Wars” music, with a rag-tag band of rebels fighting off an evil galactic empire. Citing the study (&lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/peds.2009-1962v1"&gt;Freed &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which found that 25% of parents surveyed believe that vaccines “can cause autism in healthy children” and that 60% of mothers agree or strongly agree that “I am concerned about serious adverse effects of vaccines,” Handley then gloats by congratulating his people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community, prepare to take a bow, America is listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but make three points here. First, I’m not sure why anyone would want to “take a bow” for spreading misinformation based on ignorance, outright pseudoscience, and paranoid conspiracy theories about vaccines because it has started to have some traction among the public. In my book, that’s nothing to be proud of at all. Second, if J. B. Handley is “not anti-vaccine,” why on earth would he think it’s a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing that, if the study he cites first is to be believed, parents are becoming more afraid of vaccines, so much so that he blusters and brags about his “success” in his typical fashion? J.B. clearly believes he and his ilk are the responsible for a huge increase in fear and doubt about vaccines and goes so far as to take the credit for it in the name of the “autism community” and lays out his anti-vaccine belief very clearly in a typically testosterone-laced style. Third, although the survey does raise some cause for concern, it is not as bad for supporters of science-based medicine and good for the anti-vaccine movement as Handley tries to paint it. Before I get to explaining why, let’s first note the full reason that Handley is gloating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a very different approach from the average journalist, I started doing some of my own research, and came across this study, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15710279"&gt;Parental Vaccine Safety Concerns, Results from the National Immunization Survey, 2001-2002&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was floored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember 2001-2002. My son was born in 2002. I’d barely heard of autism. I’d heard the faintest whispers about vaccines causing autism, but wrote it off as hippy-conspiracy stuff. Not surprisingly, the 2001-2002 report, unlike the 2009 report, does not even mention the word “autism.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in 2001-2002, what percent of parents expressed any concerns about the safety of vaccines? Seven. 7%. Less than 10. Five plus two. A full 93% of parents said vaccines were “completely safe.” In fact, the 2001-2002 study was exceptionally proud of the “low prevalence of vaccine safety concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a difference seven years has made. Folks, the U.S. vaccine program literally has its hair on fire. 56% of parents today are concerned about the serious adverse effects of vaccines, and 60% of moms. 56% of parents is an 8-fold, or 700% increase from 2001-2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. J.B. Handley is taking credit on behalf of the movement he leads for cranking up hysteria about vaccines, concluding, “Parents, you can now take a bow. It’s way worse than we thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yes and no. You’ll see why this is a typical bit of J.B. Handley hyperbole in a minute. On the other hand, it is very difficult to argue that fear and loathing of vaccines haven’t increased during the last decade or so. This increase in mistrust of vaccines is particularly evident in the United Kingdom, where Andrew Wakefield’s shoddy, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;trial lawyer-purchased&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_the_difference_betwee.php"&gt;incompetent&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;possibly even fraudulent&lt;/a&gt; 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; study linking the MMR vaccine to bowel problems in children, coupled with the aid of the credulous media, both witting and unwitting, has driven down MMR uptake in the U.K. to far below the level necessary for herd immunity. This decline in MMR uptake rates has predictably resulted in measles incidence skyrocketing over the last decade to the point where it has &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919"&gt;become endemic again&lt;/a&gt;. Although it took 12 years, the results of Wakefield’s malfeasance finally &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3941"&gt;came home to roost last month&lt;/a&gt;, when, in rapid succession, Wakefield was found &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3660"&gt;guilty of research misconduct&lt;/a&gt; by the U.K. General Medical Council, saw his &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper retracted by &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;’s editors, saw his infamous “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=1989"&gt;monkey study&lt;/a&gt;” withdrawn by &lt;em&gt;NeuroToxicology&lt;/em&gt;, and was then forced to resign from Thoughtful House by its board of directors, led, ironically enough, by Jane Johnson, heiress to the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. If 2009 was a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;bad year for the anti-vaccine movement&lt;/a&gt; in many ways, 2010 looks to be potentially as bad, starting with the latest &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/2010/03/vaccine-court-decision-thimerosal-containing-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;ruling from the Vaccine Court&lt;/a&gt; against the second batch of test cases, one year after the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;first batch also failed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the above developments, and more, have led the anti-vaccine movement in general and J.B. Handley in particular to lash out, and I see this latest bit of &lt;em&gt;braggadocio&lt;/em&gt; as part of that lashing out. I was particularly amused by this &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/tinderbox-us-vaccine-fears-up-700-in-7-years.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;passage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring again to the 2009 Pediatrics report that “current public health education campaigns on this issue have not been effective,” I am pleased to lay the blame for that on four people: Dr. Paul Offit, Dr. David Gorski, Amanda Peet, and Ms. Alison Singer. The data clearly shows that the efforts of these four to stem the tide of public opinion away from vaccines has been a miserable failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say, there’s nothing like being mentioned in the same sentence with Dr. Paul Offit, Alison Singer, and Amanda Peet as defenders of the vaccination program to give a nice little boost to one’s ego! And J.B. even called me “Dr.,” something he often apparently intentionally avoids doing! Seriously, I’m profoundly honored that in J.B.’s mind I deserve to be viewed as being on the same level. Think about it. Here I am, an itty-bitty blogger. Well, not exactly itty-bitty. This blog has a healthy and respectable traffic, as does my other, more infamous blog, so much so that to my shock when I traveled to St. Louis a couple of weeks ago the &lt;a href="http://skepticalstl.org/"&gt;Skeptical Society of St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; thought enough of me to arrange an impromptu get together on short notice at a local bar. Even so, to compare my feeble efforts to combat the anti-vaccine movement to those of Paul Offit, who has been a vaccine researcher for decades and made real scientific and medical contributions to eliminating infectious disease, is ridiculous. To compare me to Amanda Peet, who has many orders of magnitude more name recognition that I have, either under my real name or my more infamous pseudonym, does seem a stretch, as does comparing me to Alison Singer, who was &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/179998"&gt;forced out of Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt; because she doesn’t share the belief that vaccines cause autism and ended up forming a new autism charity called the &lt;a href="http://www.autismsciencefoundation.org"&gt;Autism Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Unrealistic or not, ridiculous or not, being considered to be on par with such people puts me in very good company indeed, although, in the words of Wayne and Garth from a couple of decades ago, “I’m not worthy, I’m not worthy!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/waynesworld.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/waynesworld.jpg" alt="we&amp;#39;re not worthy" title="waynesworld" width="341" height="296"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, all I’ve done is to have been a persistent thorn in J.B. Handley’s side through my blogging for the last five years about the vaccine pseudoscience promoted by Generation Rescue (and later Age of Autism), written one relatively popular blog, edited another popular group blog, and participated in a panel discussion about the anti-vaccine movement at TAM7 last year. All of these are worthy activities, but I can only conclude that it is a measure of J.B.’s fixation with me that he would be deluded enough to include me in such a list.  Whatever influence I’ve garnered through my personal blog and, with the help of my cobloggers,though SBM is on the order of several thousand readers. That influence is not even close to being of the same order of magnitude as that of the mainstream media or of someone like Jim Carrey or Jenny McCarthy, which makes “blaming” me for whatever failure there has been in combatting the tide of misinformation spread by various anti-vaccine organizations rather silly. I also wonder why J.B. didn’t also target Steve Novella, who’s done at least as much, if not more, than I, as he’s &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523"&gt;done in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Hollywood cast this guy as a villain? He’s perfect! Of course, Offit found Amanda Peet, who let the world know we were all parasites (anyone hear from her lately?). Go online to get the other side, and your likely to find Dr. Gorski’s blog, where a dozen anonymous commentators echo Dr. Gorski’s venomous invective – just the thing to build trust with a new mommy! The newest entrant, Ms. Peet’s replacement, is Ms. Singer, who looks like she stepped out of the morgue to take each interview and tell everyone that vaccines are safe and we all barely exist. Keep talking, Ms. Singer, keep Paul Offit on your board, and keep publicizing the “National Immunizations Conference” on your “autism science” website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit that my other persona is a tad more–shall we say?–blunt (insolent, even!) than I am when I write for SBM, but to hear J.B. complain about “venomous invective” nuked my irony meter. Generation Rescue and its propaganda arm &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; specialize in “venomous invective,” &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;as_q=paul+offit&amp;amp;as_epq=&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=10&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ageofautism.com&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=off"&gt;particularly against Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt; and anyone else who opposes its anti-vaccine agenda. After all, this is the same man who launched &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=523"&gt;personal attacks on Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt; that can only be viewed as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=465"&gt;more than venomous&lt;/a&gt;. This is the same man whose &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2415"&gt;misogynistic attacks on Amy Wallace&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist who wrote an excellent article on the anti-vaccine movement, made him infamous throughout the science-based blogosphere. This is the same man who periodically blasts away at me&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/05/david-gorski-md.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/dr-david-gorski-and-his-merry-band-of-idiots-dont-like-full-page-ads.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/11/dr-david-gorski-jumps-the-shark-over-desiree-jennings-case.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; whenever I get under his skin too much. This the same man whose blog &lt;a href="http://open.salon.com/blog/anthropologist_underground/2009/12/07/the_cannibalizing_babies_gambit"&gt;posted a Photoshopped picture&lt;/a&gt; of Steve Novella, Amy Wallace, Paul Offit, and Trine Tsouderos sitting around the table for a Thanksgiving feast, the main course of which was a baby, as shown by this screenshot taken from my computer around the time the post showed up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/cannibal.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/cannibal.jpg" alt="cannibal" title="cannibal" width="450" height="451"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was so over-the-top that even AoA ended up deleting it after a firestorm of criticism. I can’t compete with venom like that even if I wanted to, and I don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s get to the &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/peds.2009-1962v1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; touted by Handley. It did indeed show that 25% of parents polled think that vaccines can cause autism in healthy children, a disturbingly high rate, but, quite honestly, much lower than I feared it would be when I first heard about the story. However, what Handley neglects to mention is that, despite the 54% of parents expressing concern about serious adverse events due to vaccines, 90% of parents agreed that “getting vaccines is a good way to protect my child(ren) from disease” and that 88% agreed that “generally I do what my doctor recommends about vaccines for my child(ren).” These responses suggest that, although more than half of parents express concern about adverse events, most of these same parents don’t find the worries they have about vaccines compelling enough to refuse vaccination. In other words, they have heard about the concerns, most likely thanks to anti-vaccine groups and activists like Generation Rescue and J.B. Handley, but the concerns haven’t “stuck” enough to make them refuse vaccination. Unfortunately, J.B. Handley and his ilk are certainly doing their best to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More disturbing is the finding that nearly 1 in 8 parents have refused certain vaccines for their children, with newer vaccines being more likely to be refused than older vaccines. This figure suggests to me that the “too many too soon” propaganda of Generation Rescue and others, and the “alternative vaccination schedules” touted by people like Drs. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=512"&gt;Bob Sears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt; may be gaining traction. How much of that can be attributed to the propaganda of the anti-vaccine movement is impossible to say for sure, but certainly other factors are at play, including a general trend of questioning medicine more, along with the rise of the Internet, which has allowed people with no particular expertise in a topic to attend “Google U.” and conclude that they know more about a topic than researchers who have studied an issue all of their lives. While it’s true that science does advance and scientific consensuses do change, they do so through data, experimentation, and clinical research, not through conspiracy theories and misrepresentation of science. Moreover, changing public opinion has nothing to do with the validity of a position. Many more people believe in ghosts than in the scientifically discredited idea that vaccines cause autism. That does not mean ghosts exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I have to wonder whether the anti-vaccine movement has reached its high water mark in terms of public influence and J.B.’s gloating is a tad premature. After all, the last year or so has been very bad for him and his organization. Before 2009 started, study after study have failed to find a link between vaccines and autism or thimerosal and autism, many of which we’ve collected right &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org/reference/vaccines-and-autism/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2009, strong evidence showing that Andrew Wakefield had committed scientific fraud came to light, and that was followed by a ruling against the first three Autism Omnibus test cases. A series of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2815"&gt;excellent reports&lt;/a&gt; by Trine Tsouderos and Pat Callahan of the Chicago Tribune demonstrated the depths of autism quackery driven largely by anti-vaccine ideas, while exposes of the anti-vaccine movement came fast and furious from Chris Mooney for DISCOVER (&lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/jun/06-why-does-vaccine-autism-controversy-live-on/"&gt;Why Does the Vaccine/Autism Controversy Live On?&lt;/a&gt;) and Amy Wallace for WIRED (&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/10/ff_waronscience"&gt;An Epidemic of Fear: How Panicked Parents Skipping Shots Endangers Us All&lt;/a&gt;), leading to the aforementioned misogynistic attacks against Amy Wallace and a recent &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/chris-mooneys-pharmaceutical-influence.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;hilarious invocation&lt;/a&gt; of the “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3212"&gt;pharma shill&lt;/a&gt;” gambit against Chris Mooney. Since 2010 began, not only has Andrew Wakefield been completely discredited that he was forced to resign from Thoughtful House, but the Vaccine Court ruled against the second set of test cases. Meanwhile, later this year Paul Offit is scheduled to release a book about the anti-vaccine movement that paints it in a very unfavorable light. Increasingly, people are (correctly, in my estimation) viewing Jenny McCarthy as a dangerous loon abusing her celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been very critical of the AAP and CDC before. I and many others have been sounding the alarm against the anti-vaccine movement for at least five years now, and the AAP and CDC remained tone deaf to the growing vaccine denialism movement fronted by J.B. Handley and, since 2007, Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey. To me, it seemed that it wasn’t until 2009 (2008, to be generous) that health authorities in the U.S. seemed to wake up to the threat. So, since 2002, the anti-vaccine movement had the playing field to itself by and large. Now it does not. I may be the eternal optimist in this (either that, or I’m bipolar, cycling between extremes of pessimism and optimism), but for the first time since 2005, the year I first started paying attention to vaccine issues in a big way, I sense a positive shift in the national &lt;em&gt;zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt; against the anti-vaccine movement. That’s one reason why I consider it important to mention two things. First, the questionnaires for this survey were administered in January 2009. Second, I’ve sensed this change most strongly beginning in late 2008/early 2009, and accelerating in early 2010, meaning that this survey could indeed represent the high water mark of mistrust of vaccines. I also note that the spectacular flameout of Andrew Wakefield in January and February, in particular as evidenced by the retraction of his 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper, has seriously hurt the anti-vaccine movement, and don’t think they aren’t feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have to thank Mr. Handley though. His article did do more for my already inflated ego than anything since finding out at TAM7 that I’m not just an itty-bitty blogger anymore. I also thank him for laying it  on the line: The goal of the anti-vaccine movement is to spread fear and doubt about vaccines among parents, to “bring the U.S. vaccine program to its knees,” as J.B. so aptly put it. Now that we know that, we know that, for all the disclaimers of “I’m not anti-vaccine” notwithstanding, J.B. Handley and Generation Rescue are anti-vaccine to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t resist pointing out a perfect case of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/crank_magnetism_1.php"&gt;crank magneticism&lt;/a&gt; by an &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/tinderbox-us-vaccine-fears-up-700-in-7-years.html?cid=6a00d8357f3f2969e201310fb46aaa970c#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e201310fb46aaa970c" rel="nofollow"&gt;AoA commenter who left a doozy of a comment&lt;/a&gt; after the post above that amused me greatly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off Keebler count me in the quarter that denies the 18th century evolution theory that even the theorist decried before his death as he turned to God. His theory was just a 4 centuries removed from the 14th century world is flat group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also count me in the group that says global warming is Horse Sh– and the students paper it is based on, the emails that exposed the conspiracy of lies and the revelation that Al Gore used photos from a Hollyweird movie did not have anything to do with my firm conclusion. Anybody who is even remotely aware of the weather man/woman and the accuracy of their predictions clearly knows that the weather cannot be accurately predicted from Monday to Wednesday with any consistency therefore to take the word of these same people that the planet will be warmed significantly from CO2 from SUV’S and cars is beyond laughable. As any grade schooler can tell you the earth has more water than land, almost 72%, and the greatest emission of green house gases is from the ocean, God sort of planned it that way and you can take for granted that he is a wee bit smarter than you are ok genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Keebler the hysteria from people like you screaming that the glaciers are melting and that this will cause floods all over the world is nothing short of histrionics spawned by true ignorance, you see according to Archimedes principal, another high school physics tid bit, when an object displaces water, like ice does, even if it melts the water level does not rise because of the volume displaced by the ice is equal to it’s volume when melted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, water is the ONLY substance that when solid is less dense than when it is a liquid. If this were not true then the plants in the bottom of lakes, rivers and oceans in cold areas would die and not make oxygen and the fish would die and then we would eventually die. Again God planned it that way and when you know everything because you actually created everything it works really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the vaccine scam will come to an end. Physicians and surgeons everywhere outside of pediatrics and psychiatry are telling people not to vaccinate. I stand straight up and tall and look parents in the eye and tell them not to vaccinate and give them my card and tell them to tell their pediatrician to call me if he has the guts to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution denial, anthropogenic global warming denial, and vaccine denial, all in one comment! Truly, we have the crank trifecta!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less amusing is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this scam comes to an end, and it most certainly will come to an end because ALL SCAMS COME TO AN END. I personally am hoping it is through mob violence so I can get my licks in. I am going to have all of these ass wipe fraudulent studies along with the pictures of the authors printed on toilette paper of my choice, with raised lettering( so it catches more fecal material when I clean myself) on double ply paper because I want to be real comfortable when these “peer reviewed” articles and their authors from Pediatrics, Elsevier the CDC and the New England journal of Medicine do their real job. I am certain they will be great at it and that this is what their true purpose in life is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When J.B. talks about “venomous invective,” perhaps he should look at his own blog. Nowhere do I ever advocate (or even just hope for) “mob violence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t hiding in the closet. I just found the closet door.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that means that both the original president of the JREF and the current president of the JREF, two-thirds of the JREF presidents, are gay. Have anything you want to tell us, Phil Plait? Just kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what motivated the sudden public announcement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This declaration of mine was prompted just last week by seeing an  excellent film — starring Sean Penn — that told the story of politician  Harvey Milk, &lt;a title="List of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender  firsts by year" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lesbian,_gay,_bisexual,_or_transgender_firsts_by_year"&gt;the first openly gay man to be elected to public office  in California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a cinephile, I think that’s kinda awesome. What higher compliment can one give a film?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto Simon Singh, the leader of the UK Libel Reform movement who just the other day published his final article in The Guardian. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/simon-singhs-new-baby-what-can-astrology-tell-us/"&gt;Singh just introduced a new future skeptic into the world, his son Hari&lt;/a&gt;. This led Rebecca Watson to get the kid’s astrological information from Alabe.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Alabe.com, the verdict is in: &lt;strong&gt;he’s going to be a  bipolar psychic Libertarian asshole&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t most of that redundant? Anywho, congratulations you too. And keep up the great work.&lt;/p&gt;

Man, oh man, was I a cocky bitch.  I thought I had it all figured out.  My son was about a 1 1/2 years old, adorable and barely mobile, with an inability to talk back.  He still had infant toys and napped for at least 3 hours a day.  I had all sorts of time to do things like &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/08/isiss-super-family-fun-day.html"&gt;make homemade pesto&lt;/a&gt;, make other mommy bloggers feel inferior because I appeared to totally have my act together, and engage in &lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/search?q=recipe+war"&gt;elaborate recipe wars&lt;/a&gt; with drunken faculty from other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, 18 months later, I am the mother of a child who has decided that he is a blue whale.  This weekend, he demanded to be fed nothing but krill.  Thankfully, if you are a three year old blue whale, you can be tricked into believing that popcorn is krill.  Also, krill eggs and chicken eggs are remarkably similar.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/little%20isis%20the%20whale.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="little isis the whale.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/little%20isis%20the%20whale-thumb-300x450-43125.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="450" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: An artist&amp;#39;s rendition of Little Isis, a few hours after birth.  Dr. Isis looked even hotter than this woman after she had been in labor for 48 hours and had given birth to an almost 9 pound baby.  Seriously.  Combed hair and all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, my three year old has enjoyed a nutritious diet of popcorn and eggs this weekend, plus the &amp;quot;ten carrots&amp;quot; he demanded last night at dinner.  Not nine.  Not eleven.  Ten.  This was all hilarious until Little Isis blew red juice out of his blow hole this morning at breakfast.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize, now that I am the mother of a three year old, that I have gone from having Isis's "&lt;a href="http://isisthescientist.blogspot.com/2008/08/isiss-super-family-fun-day.html"&gt;Super Family Fun&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; Day to having Isis&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;For Fuck&amp;#39;s Sake Don&amp;#39;t Lose It and Choke Your Child&amp;quot; Day.  The thing about this kid though, is that just when you think you&amp;#39;re about to lose your mind, he does something so incredibly hilarious that it saves him.  For example, this morning he attempted to wake Dr. and Mr. Isis up at 6 am to go to church.  Eventually Mr. Isis convinced him that church was still several hours aways and he should go play in his room for at least another hour...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/church.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="church.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/church-thumb-400x533-43127.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="533" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2: ...so, the kid went and had church in his room.  Present on his altar made of remnants of Cars wrapping paper are a candle he found in the linen closet, the holy gospel according to. St. Nemo and the &amp;quot;donkey of God.&amp;quot;  When probed about this further, he informed me that he was unable to find his lambie to have the &amp;quot;Lamb of God.&amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; So, he settled for a donkey.  I did not have the heart to tell him that Our Lord and Savior  wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be immortalized as a jackass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, the fact remains that I just cannot keep up with him.  By the end of the day I am simply exhausted.  My gym attendance had plummeted, my general exhaustion level has skyrocketed, and I am no longer the daily blogger I once was.  These days, I am lucky to get 5 days of hilarity up on the interwebz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that this is part of the problem - when we moved to MRU, we bought a house with more than 3200 square feet.  I think we live in less than 1000 of those square feet.   On a daily basis, the Isises inhabit their respective bedrooms, plus the kitchen and adjoining family room.  This leaves us with two completely unused bedrooms, an unused living room, and 1000 square feet of fully finished, uninhabited basement with carpeting, furniture, and a functioning bar and fridge.  Every day the family room adjoining the kitchen basically looks like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/house%201.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="house 1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/house%201-thumb-300x225-43129.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="225" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3: Exhibit A.  Note Little Isis&amp;#39;s tent, toys, and the laundry&lt;/b&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was my house on Saturday afternoon.  It basically looks like this every afternoon.  I spent most of Saturday afternoon and evening cleaning it up.  One hour into Sunday morning, it looked like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/house%203.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="house 3.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/house%203-thumb-300x400-43133.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="400" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 4: Exhibit B.  Still laundry on the hearth, but now there is some kind of major construction project happening at the end of the room involving a bulldozer and some hippos.  Clearly, however, this project is not being done to code because someone isn&amp;#39;t wearing a hardhat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today I decided that I have had enough and that I need some parts of the house that can be more easily managed.  I need some portions of the house that I am not constantly either cleaning myself, or forcing Little Isis to clean.  The solution?  I have banished Little Isis to the basement and we have renamed it his &amp;quot;playroom.&amp;quot;  I have decided that the playroom will be like fight club - what happens in the playroom stays in the playroom.  As long as no one gets cholera, it can be as messy as he pleases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result...&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/house%205.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="house 5.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/house%205-thumb-300x400-43135.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="400" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 5: Exhibit C.  Some semblance of normalcy returns to the family room?  Note, however, that the fucking laundry continues its infestation.  Also, note the new presence of two bottles of wine on the counter.  Only one remains.  I assure you, that is not wine in Little Isis&amp;#39;s sippy cup.  That&amp;#39;s the red juice he blew out of his blow hole.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing I could not convince Little Isis to move to the basement was the tent.  The tent is now on my bedroom floor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/house2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="house2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/house2-thumb-300x400-43131.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="400" width="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 6: And I am sure I'll be hearing from Little Isis at 6 am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I love it when they're wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to be able to sleep in, but if I can't sleep in, I don't mind the sound of tiny footsteps.  After whipping up a batch of heart-shaped Daddy pancakes, the kiddo and I took off for work.  It wasn't looking good out---cloudy, windy, a little bitter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounds were brief, and we had time for a stop at the bookstore before lunch.  PalKid loves to go to our local sushi joint for rice, edemame, and udon soup, and to watch me eat various raw and wriggly things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief rest, the kiddo noticed something---the sun was out, and so were the neighbor kids.  It's funny how in this part of the world everyone disappears for the winter, popping out like crocuses as soon as the snow melts.  We took a couple of turns around the block on the Trail-a-bike with the neighbor girls close behind, and then PalKid was ready---she wanted to take off her training wheels.  Luckily, my neighbor has taught three girls how to ride already, and he lent a hand.  In a little while, she was taking a few yards of road and making them her own---until falling off and skinning her knee, milking the injury for all it was worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was pretty sure we'd be locked inside all day, looking for a good movie to watch.  Seeing my kid take her first---brief and tentative---bike ride beats it hands down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/_fWmeQQaavc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269212481558"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4275">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/51e72f0b3a57e4c0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">KA at Boston Skeptics in the Pub March 29</title><published>2010-03-21T22:01:26Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T22:01:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4275" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yers truly will speak at &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?page_id=248"&gt;Tommy Doyle’s, Harvard Square, Cambridge.&lt;/a&gt; 7:00 PM on March 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implausible Health Claims and Human Studies Ethics: A Collision Course&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broad international consensus regarding protections for subjects in human trials emerged during the 2nd half of the 20th century. It can be summarized in several tenets, most of which pertain explicitly or implicitly to scientific considerations. Recent projects involving human trials of implausible health claims (”CAM”) have been at odds with some of those tenets. I’ll discuss one trial in detail and mention a few others. I will argue that all such trials are likely to be unethical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Guide-Good-Life-Ancient-Stoic/dp/0195374614/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1269208998&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by philosophy professor and Stoic practitioner William B. Irvine. It’s a wonderful book explaining the essence of Stoicism, with an emphasis on how to practice Stoicism in your life, and it’s a very easy-to-read book I’d highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to address the issue of consumerism in my own life and in my articles for some time. I have nothing against reasonably regulated capitalism, and in fact, see it as highly relevant to personal liberty; but my concerns are more on the individual effects of consumerism on a person. There is an element to our consumer based society in the United States today that is not only of concern because of what it means to the environment and our natural resources, but also because of how it effects our freedom and how much control we lend to corporations over our lives and even or very culture. I was therefore struck by what Irvine wrote on the topic because it touched on Stoicism more intimately than I had expected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Stoics, as we have seen, recommend simplifying one’s lifestyle… If you start dressing down, people will notice. Likewise, people will notice if you keep driving the same old car or – horrors! – give up the car to take the bus or ride a bike. People will assume the worst: impending bankruptcy, perhaps, or even the early stages of mental illness… And if you explain to them that you have overcome your desire to impress those who are impressed by a person’s external trappings, you will only make matters worse…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since becoming a Stoic my desires have changed dramatically. I no longer want many of the things I once took to be essential for proper living…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I read that many of my fellow Americans are in deep financial trouble. They have an unfortunate tendency to use up all the credit that is available to them and, when this doesn’t satisfy their craving for consumer goods, to keep spending anyway…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have become dysfunctional as a consumer. When I go to the mall, for example, I don’t buy things; instead, I look around me and am astonished by all the things for sale that I not only don’t need but can’t imagine myself wanting. My only entertainment at a mall is to watch the other mall-goers. Most of them, I suspect, come to the mall not because there is something specific that they need to buy. Rather, they come in the hope that doing so will trigger a desire for something that, before going to the mall, they didn’t want…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why go out of their way to trigger a desire? Because if they trigger one, they can enjoy the rush that comes when they extinguish that desire by buying its object. It is a rush, of course, that has as little to do with their long-term happiness as taking a hit of heroin has to do with the long-term happiness of a heroin addict.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to begin finding ways to simplify my own life in terms of possessions and material needs. My wife and I already do a fair job of living well below our means, but sometimes the amount of ‘junk’ we collect can be a cause of frustration. I also have been thinking about how one might phrase a short collection of simplified principles and behavioral standards that could help guide one away from consumerism and toward alternatives that can be even more fulfilling, especially around times like Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irvine’s book has a lot more about Stoic thought, values, and practices in it a person can use to begin their journey. At times when discussing practice, he seems a bit preoccupied with the danger that others may ridicule you for practicing Stoicism, and this may be colored by his own experiences. But all in all it is a solid read for beginners and philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

Much progress has been made - &lt;a href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/defending-free-speech-keep-libel-laws.html"&gt;the Liberal Democrats have pledged their support to libel reform&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/parliament-endorses-libel-reform-on-day.html"&gt;Parliamentary Select Committee report last month endorsed many of the Campaign's claims&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, with the General Election looming, there remains a &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2010/03/last-chance-for-libel-reform-mass-lobby-of-mps-next-tuesday/"&gt;pressing need to show our representatives that libel reform is urgently required&lt;/a&gt; to preserve our freedom of expression; to ensure that scientific discourse can proceed free of the fear of censure; that journalists can continue to hold those in power to account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you can make it to Parliament on Tuesday, please write to your MP by visiting &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2010/03/last-chance-for-libel-reform-mass-lobby-of-mps-next-tuesday/"&gt;theyworkforyou&lt;/a&gt;, and asking you MP to meet you between 3pm and 4pm in Central Lobby. At 2pm there will be a meeting where leading campaingers will share their experience and prepare for the Mass Lobby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please try and come along if you're able to do so, we really do need to make a strong statement to to MPs from all parties - that we urgently need to reform our libel laws, in the interest of free debate - and we have one last chance to make our voices heard this side of the election.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/488262047686109051-2782361493825511443?l=teekblog.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269204496148"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=9811">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/710800ac4528407e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Adaptations"/><category term="Articles"/><category term="flowers"/><category term="frogs"/><category term="mullein"/><category term="phenology"/><title type="html">March is the cruelest month…</title><published>2010-03-21T20:48:10Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T20:48:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/21/march-is-the-cruelest-month" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Greg Mayer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…breeding mulleins out of the dead land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Mullein along railroad track, Arlington, Virginia, March 12, 2010." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn4598.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mullein along railroad track, Arlington, Virginia, March 12, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a visit to the Washington, DC, area last weekend I made a point of looking at how advanced the spring greening was. Despite  the east coast’s hard winter, and the mild winter in the midwest (and 2010 in general is &lt;a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/?report=global"&gt;starting off quite warm&lt;/a&gt;), things are much more alive (as I expected) in the east, but still pretty gray-brown. In addition to the mulleins above (the greenish ground rosettes, with last year’s meter high flowering stalks still standing in many), a number of flowers (all in cultivation) had also emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Washington, DC, March 17, 2010." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn46551-e1269202772985.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=666" alt="Washington, DC, March 17, 2010." width="500" height="666"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington, DC, March 17, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img title="Suitland, Maryland, March 16, 2010." src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/dscn4645.jpg?w=500&amp;amp;h=375" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suitland, Maryland, March 16, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early emergence is a &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/grsm/naturescience/wildflowers.htm"&gt;key adaptation for many plants&lt;/a&gt;, especially those of the forest understory. Later in the season, the forest floor will be in deep shade from the trees, so many herbaceous and small woody plants take advantage of the photosynthetic opportunities provided by the early spring. The animals were also active– fish crows and mockingbirds on the Mall in DC–, but most noticeably large and loud choruses of spring peepers (&lt;em&gt;Pseudacris crucifer&lt;/em&gt;, a tree frog) in many places in Prince William and northern Stafford Counties, Virginia. I attempted to record a chorus in Dumfries, Virginia, and thought I had, but the file came up blank, so you’ll just have to imagine hundreds of little frogs, all saying “peep” at the same time (or&lt;a href="http://www.dnr.state.md.us/wildlife/northern_spring_peeper.html"&gt; listen here&lt;/a&gt;). When I lived in the DC area, peepers began calling around the same time redwinged blackbirds did, February 15, so they’ve probably been calling for around a month already. No frog calls yet in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

I even wonder if it was to prevent some embarrassment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, the section 127 offence in respect of "menace" (it can also be used for grossly offensive, indecent, or obscene messages) is rarely used; indeed, there is no reported case law.  Even the &lt;a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/#p_13"&gt; CPS's own guidance on section 127 &lt;/a&gt;recommends that the 1977 Act is to be preferred for supposed bomb hoaxes.  And problems can easily occur when an unfamiliar offence is prosecuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third, the section 127 offence still clearly required evidence of an intention to menace; this could be inferred from the House of Lords 2006 case of &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/40.html"&gt; Collins&lt;/a&gt; in respect of offensive messages.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I wrote in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Bad Law&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"Presumably the “menacing” element of section 127(1) would be treated in a similar way [to Collins]....the offence surely still required Paul Chambers to have intended the message to be menacing to whom it related or be aware that it may be taken to be so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accordingly, I warned an injustice was occurring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I now understand that, partly because of my blogposts, a sequence of events led to the case taking a new and more encouraging turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week, after a couple of adjournments, an application was made for the "Guilty" plea to be vacated.  Such applications are exceptional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The district judge accepted the application.  This is even more exceptional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand that the reason was for the court to be able to re-consider the required intention.  It would seem that those involved in the original prosecution had assumed the offence was strict liability and proceeded on that basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the district judge now wants to hear argument as to the required intention for the offence to be committed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, following &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Collins&lt;/span&gt;, there is a clear requirement for the prosecution to prove intention of menace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If so, then it would appear to me that the CPS are perhaps now in a difficult position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8524062.stm"&gt; the BBC&lt;/a&gt; report, the CPS said at the first trial:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"[Mr Chambers] admitted posting the message into the public domain but never intended the message to be received by the airport or for them to take it seriously."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, in a response to a question in my &lt;a href="http://www.thelawyer.com/the-twitter-%E2%80%9Cbomb-hoax%E2%80%9D-case-worse-than-we-thought?/1003651.article"&gt; Bad Law&lt;/a&gt; column, the CPS press office stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;“A more serious charge under section 51 Criminal Law Act 1977 was considered but was not felt to be appropriate as there was no evidence that he intended to induce in the recipient a false belief there really was a bomb.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either of these statements - in my view - would tend to go against any attempt by the CPS to now show sufficient intention of menace for the section 127 offence to be prosecuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, one can not be certain; and it is entirely a matter for the court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We shall find out in May what happens when legal argument is due to be heard.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be that the court holds it is indeed a strict liability offence; or that it holds that the prosecution has shown sufficient intention on the part of Mr Chambers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One can never predict what a judge will do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the vacation of the guilty plea, it is of course nice to feel that any blogpost has some practical effect.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope the vacation of the plea works out and that, in the event of a conviction, Mr Chambers is not worse off than if he had maintained his plea of guilty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it would have been far nicer if the South Yorkshire Police and the CPS had not, in my opinion, over-reacted to a (bad) joke on Twitter, which itself caused no direct inconvenience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, bomb hoaxes should not be taken lightly; that is the reason why Parliament legislated for a specific offence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once it was clear that there could not be a successful prosecution under the 1977 Act, the case should have simply stopped there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It surely would have been in the public interest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-8443432147097382212?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269202936987"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22652">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0ae52b2d8ab868b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="GLBT"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">James Randi Comes Out</title><published>2010-03-21T20:02:50Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T20:02:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/21/james-randi-comes-out/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t evoke any big reaction anymore, but it’s a wonderful thing anytime someone feels comfortable enough to come out of the closet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;81-year-old &lt;strong&gt;James Randi&lt;/strong&gt; has done just that today on &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/914-how-to-say-it.html"&gt;the JREF blog &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href="http://www.forgoodreason.org/james_randi_a_skeptic_comes_out_at_81"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Good Reason&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, here goes. I really resent the term, but I use it because it’s recognized and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should apologize for having used &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt; as the venue to publish this note, an item that is hardly the focus of what we promote and publish here, but I chose the single most public asset I have to make this statement. It’s from here that I have attacked irrationality, stupidity, and irresponsibility, and it is my broadest platform. Here is where I have chosen to stand and fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that I have already won this battle by simply publishing this statement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s absolutely right.  It doesn’t matter his age or his status.  It’s always a powerful, courageous, and difficult statement to make.  I’m only sorry Randi felt he had to wait this long to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time someone comes out, it’s an inspiration for another LGBT person to do the same.  Here’s hoping Randi’s statement gives someone else that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, this means that both Randi and the new president of JREF (&lt;strong&gt;DJ Grothe&lt;/strong&gt;) are out gay men.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Watson&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/james-randi-comes-out-of-the-closet-at-81/"&gt;explains the potential significance of this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… I sincerely hope that this helps highlight the fact that the skeptical community is a diverse one. I also hope this helps a higher profile… organization tackles more gay/skeptic issues, which happily DJ goes into at the end of the interview. Randi agrees that the JREF will take on gay rights issues as they call for it. Awesome.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/crowdsourcing-honesty/" title=""&gt;Crowdsourcing Honesty?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, we are far more likely to be honest when reminded of morality, especially when temptation strikes. Ariely thus concludes that the act of taking an oath can make all the difference.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2010/03/18/craig-newmark-on-the-webs-next-big-problem/" title=""&gt;Craig Newmark on the Web's Next Big Problem&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And what is that? The question of who to trust online, according to Newmark. To solve it, he believes that what the web needs is a "distributed trust network" that allows us to manage our online relationships and reputations. I just happened to have a Flip video camera with me, so I convinced him to let me capture a few minutes of him discussing this concept; I've embedded the clip below.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://emergentbydesign.com/2010/03/20/how-to-spark-a-snowcrash-what-the-web-really-does/" title=""&gt;How to Spark a Snowcrash, &amp;amp; What the Web Really Does&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;All of us have a trust network already "in real life." It's your family and your close friends and colleagues, all those strong ties, and also your extended family, community, and coworkers, your weak ties. These people are crucial, they are your companions day to day. But what about people beyond your real life connections? Is there a way to extend our connections and build trust with strangers who have a diversity of backgrounds, skills, strengths, resources, and knowledge? People who could help us if we needed help? Could we establish a global trust network?

&lt;p&gt;What I discovered through Twitter was that there are people out there who know what community means. Who really, truly know. These people have already internalized what a society could look like based on a cooperative model, and it seems that this is what's really going on on the web. Beyond all the superficial stuff out there, all the mindless entertainment and porn, at the core (or maybe at the periphery) is a community of....thousands?....millions?....of people who have jobs and careers and passions that they carry out "in the real world," but have already embraced the vision of a much different way of life that is based in trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/crowdsourcing_honesty_and_trus.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/kZQdnImgwmU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269202360399"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/chester-finn-on-the-case-for-saturday-school.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1cdaa974850c6c72</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education: Public Schools"/><title type="html">Chester Finn on The Case for Saturday School</title><published>2010-03-21T19:42:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T19:42:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/chester-finn-on-the-case-for-saturday-school.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704207504575130073852829574.html"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that rather than increasing the &amp;quot;time on task&amp;quot; it would behoove school reformers to look at curriculum&lt;a href="http://kitchentablemath.blogspot.com/2010/03/effect-size.html"&gt; effect sizes&lt;/a&gt; first.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269202222405"><id gr:original-id="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/accepting-chronic-pain/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d494a1f3d688c7e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Accepting chronic pain</title><published>2010-03-21T14:21:45Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T14:21:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/jbPaB_BXmo8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://healthskills.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/accepting-chronic-pain/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">How willing are you to have persistent pain?

Even the &lt;a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/communications_offences/#p_13"&gt; CPS own guidance on section 127 &lt;/a&gt;recommends that the 1977 Act is to be preferred for supposed bomb hoaxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third, the section 127 offence clearly required proof of an intention to menace; this could be inferred from the House of Lords 2006 case of &lt;a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/40.html"&gt; Collins&lt;/a&gt; in respect of offensive messages.  Accordingly, I wrote in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Bad Law&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"Presumably the “menacing” element of section 127(1) would be treated in a similar way [to Collins].  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It did not matter if the message was received, which would not count in the favour of Paul Chambers;  but the offence surely still required Paul Chambers to have intended the message to be menacing to whom it related or be aware that it may be taken to be so."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accordingly, I warned an injustice was occurring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I now understand that, partly but not wholly because of my blogposts, a sequence of events led to the case taking a new and more encouraging turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week, after a couple of adjournments, an application was made for the "&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Guilty&lt;/span&gt;" plea to be vacated.  Such applications are exceptional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The district judge accepted the application.  This is even more exceptional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand that the point was about intention.  It would seem that those involved  in the original prosecution had assumed the offence was strict liability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The district judge now wants to hear argument as to the required intention for the offence to be committed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my view, following Collins, there is a requirement for the prosecution to prove an intention of menace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If so, then it would appear to me that the CPS are perhaps now in a difficult position to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8524062.stm"&gt; the BBC&lt;/a&gt; report, the CPS said at the first trial:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;"[Mr Chambers] admitted posting the message into the public domain but never intended the message to be received by the airport or for them to take it seriously."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in a response to a question in my &lt;a href="http://www.thelawyer.com/the-twitter-%E2%80%9Cbomb-hoax%E2%80%9D-case-worse-than-we-thought?/1003651.article"&gt; Bad Law&lt;/a&gt; column, the CPS press office stated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;“A more serious charge under section 51 Criminal Law Act 1977 was considered but was not felt to be appropriate as there was no evidence that he intended to induce in the recipient a false belief there really was a bomb.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either of these statements - in my view - would tend to undermine any attempt by the CPS to now show sufficient intention for the section 127 offence to be prosecuted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, one can not be certain and it is a matter for the court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We shall find out in May what happens when the legal argument is due to be heard.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It may be that the court holds it is indeed a strict liability offence; or that the prosecution has shown sufficient intention on the part of Mr Chambers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One can never predict what a judge will do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the vacation of the guilty plea, it is of course nice to feel that any blogpost has some practical effect.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it would have been far nicer if the South Yorkshire Police and the CPS had not, in my opinion, over-reacted to a (bad) joke on Twitter, which itself caused no direct inconvenience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, bomb hoaxes should not be taken lightly; that is the reason why Parliament legislated for a specific offence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once it was clear that there could not be a successful prosecution under the 1977 Act, the case should have simply stopped there.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published; always use a name for ease of reference by other commenters.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-921564086969030083?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269200277221"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=12886">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d849aef86116190c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">AI: Podcasts</title><published>2010-03-21T19:00:27Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T19:00:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/ai-podcasts/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=5fbe618e00e7572fe179f8952e0d6d2a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Psychics has a new podcast called “The Badcast”, but is also known as the &lt;a href="http://badpsychics.co.uk/thefraudfiles/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1200"&gt;Bad Psychics Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t hiding in the closet. I just found the closet door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randi also mentions in the interview with DJ that the beard wasn’t an attempt to look more manly. It’s just his awesome magical style, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thrilled when DJ was hired as president of the JREF, not only because he’s a talented, intelligent person but also because he’s openly gay. Just as I want to see more interaction between skeptics and feminists, I also love to see overlap between the gay and other civil rights groups with the skeptical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though in the middle of his interview Randi makes clear that the JREF isn’t a “gay organization” now that the top two guys there are out homosexuals, I sincerely hope that this helps highlight the fact that the skeptical community is a diverse one. I also hope this helps a higher profile (than Skepchick, fer instance) organization tackle more gay/skeptic issues, which happily DJ goes into at the end of the interview. Randi agrees that the JREF will take on gay rights issues as they call for it. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats, Randi.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269197702304"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5a5f1e6487210a78</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">How To Say It?</title><published>2010-03-21T17:37:49Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T17:37:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/914-how-to-say-it.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, here goes. I really resent the term, but I use it because it’s recognized and accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From some seventy years of personal experience, I can tell you that there’s not much “gay” about being homosexual. For the first twenty years of my life, I had to live in the shadows, in a culture that was — at least outwardly — totally hostile to any hint of that variation of life-style. At no time did I choose to adopt any protective coloration, though; my cultivation of an abundant beard was not at all a deception, but part of my costume as a conjuror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the general attitude that I’d perceived around me began to change, and presently I find that there has emerged a distinctly healthy acceptance of different social styles of living — except, of course, in cultures that live in constant and abject fear of divine retribution for infractions found in the various Holy Books… In another two decades, I’m confident that young people will find themselves in a vastly improved atmosphere of acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before publishing this statement, I chose to privately notify a number of my closest friends and colleagues — none of whom, I’m sure, have been at all surprised at this “coming out.” I’m prepared to receive the inevitable barrage of jeers and insults from the “grubbies” out there who will jump to their keyboards in glee to notify others of their kind about this statement, which to them will be yet further proof of the perfidy of the rationalist mode of life that I have chosen. Those titters of joy will be unheard over the murmur of acceptance that I confidently expect from my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This declaration of mine was prompted just last week by seeing an excellent film — starring Sean Penn — that told the story of politician Harvey Milk, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lesbian,_gay,_bisexual,_or_transgender_firsts_by_year" title="List of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender firsts by year"&gt;the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California&lt;/a&gt;. I’m in excellent company: Barney Frank, Oscar Wilde, Stephen Fry, Ellen DeGeneres, Rachel Maddow, are just a few of those who were in my thoughts as I pressed the key that placed this on &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt; and before the whole world…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should apologize for having used &lt;em&gt;Swift&lt;/em&gt; as the venue to publish this note, an item that is hardly the focus of what we promote and publish here, but I chose the single most public asset I have to make this statement. It’s from here that I have attacked irrationality, stupidity, and irresponsibility, and it is my broadest platform. Here is where I have chosen to stand and fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that I have already won this battle by simply publishing this statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: To hear an extensive discussion of this issue, please &lt;a href="http://www.forgoodreason.org/james_randi_a_skeptic_comes_out_at_81"&gt;listen to my appearance on &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forgoodreason.org/james_randi_a_skeptic_comes_out_at_81"&gt;For Good Reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Hector Avalos and Robert Price left it because of biblical criticism, both OT and NT respectively. Exapologist left it because of the failed prediction that Jesus was to return in his generation. Ken Pulliam left it because there was no cogent explanation of the atonement. William Dever left it because of biblical archaeology. Bart Ehrman left it because of the problem of suffering. My claim is that people leave the fold for so many different reasons because there are so many different reasons to do so. What other former Christian authors/scholars do you know and why did they leave the fold?

It is of the great facts in the world like sunlight, or springtime, or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon. &lt;i&gt;-Oscar Wilde&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Yesterday was the spring equinox for the Northern Hemisphere, and my city was lucky enough to have a glorious day, clear skies, warm weather, and I spent most of the day outside.  I had the type of day that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Tyminski"&gt;Dan Tyminski&lt;/a&gt; pines for in this song, &lt;i&gt;Some Early Morning&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/URkWZvEF5pc%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yesterday -- the equinox -- was special for another reason that you don't often hear about.  You see, the Earth rotates on its axis, tilted at a fairly severe 23.5 degrees.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/weekend_diversion_a_little_sun/equinox.jpg" width="500" height="421" alt="equinox.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the months April through August, the northern hemisphere gets long days and lots of sunlight, while the South Pole gets nothing but freezing darkness.  On the other hand, from October through February, the southern hemisphere gets the long days, while the North Pole never sees the Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But our equinoxes -- and we only get two per year -- are very, very special.  The Sun illuminates &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; parts of the Earth equally on these days.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/weekend_diversion_a_little_sun/Earth-lighting-equinox_EN1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/weekend_diversion_a_little_sun/Earth-lighting-equinox_EN1-thumb-500x328-43085.png" width="500" height="328" alt="Earth-lighting-equinox_EN1.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the only days of the year where everywhere on Earth has a chance at Sunlight.  Moreover, on the equinoxes, everybody gets twelve hours of Sun (well, they would if the skies were clear) and twelve hours of night.  &lt;i&gt;Everyone&lt;/i&gt;.  North Pole, South Pole, Equator, and everywhere in between.  Starting today and all the days after for the next six months, someone at the South Pole will &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; see the Sun.  Just like for the prior six months, Santa Claus (and everyone else at the North Pole) never saw the Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/weekend_diversion_a_little_sun/Santa_North_Pole.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/weekend_diversion_a_little_sun/Santa_North_Pole-thumb-500x295-43087.png" width="500" height="295" alt="Santa_North_Pole.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spring equinox was not only our switch, it was one of two days a year where everyone got the same amount of daylight.  That's even where the word &lt;b&gt;equinox&lt;/b&gt; comes from: equi = equal + nox = night.  So I hope you enjoyed it, and to those of you in the northern hemisphere with me, we've got six months where things should only get better!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/weekend_diversion_a_little_sun.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269189469843"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=4893">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66032b3d5571a54c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Holford, Burne and homeopathy on the NHS</title><published>2010-03-21T15:39:43Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T15:39:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2010/03/21/holford-burne-and-homeopathy-on-the-nhs/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Jerome Burne posts on Patrick Holford's blog about the need to "Save NHS money on ineffective drugs, not homeopathy".

The Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity were on Facebook pretty quickly, and a flood of other space probes followed suit. Twitter is well-populated by NASA people, including astronaut &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/Astro_Soichi"&gt;Soichi Noguchi&lt;/a&gt;, who has been tweeting tirelessly from orbit recently, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/13/space-tweeting/"&gt;posting one amazing picture after another&lt;/a&gt; of cities, landscapes, and even the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing NASA is careful about is archiving material. They are well aware of the importance of the work they’re doing, and public outreach is a critical aspect of it. That’s why I’m happy to see a new effort on the part of the space agency &lt;a href="https://archive-it.org/collections/1740"&gt;to archive all their social media outlets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s just started, so it’s a bit sparse, but I can see this being very useful to future historians. It may seem silly to have an online record of all the official tweets from NASA people, but in fact there is a wealth of information there. And it’s not just Twitter; it’s also Flickr for pictures, and YouTube for videos. I can see this expanding to Facebook, too, and other social networks. There’s a brief intro to the archive &lt;a href="http://words.nasaimages.org/2010/03/05/archiving-nasa/"&gt;on the NASA images blog&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA does a pretty decent job of being transparent to its stakeholders — that’s you, folks — far better than most other government agencies, despite being online in far larger proportion than them as well.

She will, I hope, be a guest on Point of Inquiry at some point.

Blum weaves a masterful tale of how modern forensic medicine emerged during the era of Prohibition as a doctor-toxicologist team hunt down murderers who use arsenic, mercury, and cyanide, and try to protect the public health from threats like tetraethyl lead, wood alcohol, and carbon monoxide. Move over, CSI Miami--here's CSI 1920s New York. Just amazing stuff; no wonder Blum is at around # 240 0n Amazon right now....</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269185505490"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/animal_rights_and_human_needs_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f3b0ce016e738d18</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Animal Rights"/><title type="html">Animal Rights and Human Needs: Foundations of the debate (Part II)</title><published>2010-03-21T16:23:41Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T16:23:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/iY--dtPmbn8/animal_rights_and_human_needs_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/animal_rights_and_human_needs_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/animal_rights_and_human_needs.php"&gt;Continued from Part 1 ... &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/animal_rights_and_human_needs_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/animal_rights_and_human_needs_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/iY--dtPmbn8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269185088795"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2200">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/911c96dc7cae3c45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Guys</title><published>2010-03-21T15:15:30Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T15:15:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2200" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Erin McKean, "&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/03/21/hey_guys/"&gt;Hey guys! Yes, ladies, this means you&lt;/a&gt;", Boston Globe, 3/21/2010:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the study of peevology, language subdivision, one of the more fertile areas of inquiry is the long list of things that people are annoyed to be called. Not the truly offensive terms — none of which can be printed here, and all of which have a level of discomfort far higher than “pet peeve’’ — but the more general terms, whose offense is often magnified when they’re used by strangers involved in a commercial transaction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Some people hate to be called “honey,’’ or “sugar.’’ A few feel that any use of “hey’’ as an attention-getter is rude (with the classic retort being “Hey is for horses’’). Others believe that being called “ma’am’’ ages them 10 years. But one of the more widespread vocative peeves, at least for women, is being addressed as “you guys.’’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Whether it’s the group e-mail that opens “Hi Guys!’’ or the waiter who says “OK, guys, your table is ready,’’ the use of “you guys’’ for groups of mixed gender (and even for all-female groups) can send the needle on many peeve-ometers into the red.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the article, Erin makes an important point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;J&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;ust to be clear, I’m not saying that anyone, male or female, doesn’t have the right to be offended at being called “you guys.’’ This is America; you’re allowed to be offended by whatever you choose. You can be offended at not being addressed “Commander SnorkelFritz, Hero Third Class of The Loompian Hegemony,’’ and I will fully support your indignation…and not just because I want to see your uniform, commander.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He no longer had insurance, but he had plenty of health problems.  Our office normally doesn't see uninsured patients (we simply can't afford to) but from time to time we make exceptions. I changed his prescriptions to the cheapest possible effective medications and gave him&lt;a href="http://www.needymeds.org"&gt; an online resource&lt;/a&gt; for the meds that did not have inexpensive alternatives.  I referred him to a clinic that has the resources to care for the uninsured and that may be able to help him get his diabetic supplies.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing this, I shifted the cost of this man's care from my small office to a larger entity.  But the money for his care still must come from somewhere.  It's possible that his new clinic may get "disproportionate share (DISH)" dollars from the federal government if they care for many uninsured patients, but it's also likely that the clinic will never completely recoup the cost of his care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The uninsured are an unnecessary burden on our health care system. Treating someone without insurance is the most expensive way to provide care.  Rather than having the cost and risk of their care pooled with others, the cost falls directly on the patient, who cannot afford it, and is taken on by hospitals and clinics struggling to stay open.  Doctors' fees are only a small part of this burden.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the tactics being taken by the anti-health care reform movement is to&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/03/will_health_care_reform_cause.php"&gt; hype the doctor shortage&lt;/a&gt;.  Doctors have been &lt;em&gt;kvetching &lt;/em&gt;about our health care system forever.  When HMOs rose in popularity in the late part of the 20th century, doctors found the increased paperwork, patient loads, and capitated reimbursement unconscionable.  And so did patients.  HMOs have changed dramatically since then partly in response to these forces.  One glaring fact in health care is that it is difficult to make extraordinary profits while maintaining a significant level of customer satisfaction. Health care is about people's lives.  It is not just another commodity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But HMOs didn't kill medicine, and neither will the health care bill likely to pass tonight.  Primary care medicine is not a lucrative profession and most primary care docs are in it for the right reasons.  That doesn't mean we won't quit if practice becomes overly burdensome, but the thought of PCPs quitting &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt; is laughable.  But we are already having trouble &lt;i&gt;creating&lt;/i&gt; enough PCPs.   About four percent of American medical graduates choose primary care.  One of the reasons for this is the enormous debt they incur during their education: close to 200K average.  Primary care medicine simply doesn't pay well enough to manage the debt well.  And primary care is becoming more important as we learn more about medicine.  We have measures of effective care now that should be tracked, such as how often a diabetic receives foot and eye care.  Private insurers have discovered this, and want the data to help reduce costs: prevent progression of diabetes-related diseases, and profit goes up.  Private insurers have started giving "bonuses" for this data, which in effect means withholding money to doctors unless they get the data.  Collecting and reporting this data, without a unique, national database, is a huge burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If health care reform passes, it's unlikely that this would change.  This is coming one way or another---it's good for our health, and we physicians will have to find a way to adjust, as we always have.  But we'll need some rational actions to help us.  Creating a national database, one that is compatible with our own electronic health records; creating interoperability between EHRs; and providing the resources to help physicians track this data is something that cannot be done on the level of individual practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our health care "system" is being hobbled by millions of uninsured and lack of any support for prevention.  If health care reform fixes only the first problem, that's a start.  I love having full exam rooms a crowded waiting room.  Hopefully, we will keep an eye on part two, and make it possible for people to choose to practice primary care, and to do so effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/caWeTpc4BHc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269180057798"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-663424857613211204">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0183513343be8b77</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Benefits of Chiropractic Care?</title><published>2010-03-21T13:23:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T13:23:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/03/benefits-of-chiropractic-care.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;As most of you know, chiropractors in the UK are coming under the gun for making false, unscientific claims. This backlash was prompted by a suit launched by the British Chiropractic Association against &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Singh"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;. Singh&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;crime&amp;quot;?—he suggested in an newspaper article that many claims by chiropractors were bogus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to support Simon Singh and support attempts to fix British libel laws go to the &lt;i&gt;Sense About Science&lt;/i&gt; website: &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/333/"&gt;National Petition for Libel Law Reform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The regulations governing chiropractors in North America are much more lax than those in the UK. Canadian and American chiropractors can make all sorts of claims about their treatment—claims that have no scientific evidence to support them—without incurring any penalties. Whereas British chiropractor websites have been take down for fear of prosecution, those in North America are still going strong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was reminded of this today when a chiropractor posted a comment on &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/11/canadas-new-minister-of-state-science.html"&gt;Canada's New Minister of State (Science and Technology) Is a Chiropractor&lt;/a&gt;. "Dr."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Ross Carter included a link to his website, which advertises his private practice, so I had to delete the comment and replace it with a modified version.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just for fun, here's some of the clams that are posted on &lt;a href="http://www.chiropractorsuwaneega.com/benefits-of-chiropractic-care.html"&gt;GentleDR.com&lt;/a&gt;. According to Ross Carter, chiropractic care can help with a lot of problems such as ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For pregnant women, they are able to deliver much easier.&lt;li&gt;For babies, they have improved developmental abilities and prevent the possibility of acquiring scoliosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For kids, it helps prevent asthma, ear infection, bedwetting, among other things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For adults, they are able to generate more energy and increase productivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For senior individuals, they attain better balance and prevent injury caused by falling off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don't think any of these claims would be allowed in the UK. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The National Governors' Association has just published a draft version  of new &lt;a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Files/K12ELAStandards.pdf"&gt;Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, which are open  for public comment. I'm an education professor in the area of literacy  with a special interest in grammar and related topics, and was wondering  if you or other authors of Language Log would be interested in creating  a post about them, since I know there have often been comments on the  blog about published grammar advice for teachers. These standards are a  big deal, since 48 states have agreed to adopt them. They're likely to  have a big impact on curriculum for the foreseeable future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SW suggests that LL readers may want to read the draft and submit comments, and that some discussion in LL posts and comments may be useful. According to the c&lt;a href="http://www.corestandards.org/"&gt;ommoncore.org web site&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;These standards are now open for public comment until Friday, April 2″.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;José Gumilla was a priest in charge of the sick on the plantation, and when Mary Sabina was about six months old, he happened to see her when she was with her mother.  He discussed the child's extraordinary appearance with Patrona.  Mary Sabina had piebaldism, resulting in the astonishing spotted effect visible in the two portraits of her in the gallery.  Patrona put it down to the fact that she had a pet dog of black and white colouring of which she had become fond whilst pregnant.

(2006) has an excellent table to illustrate where declines in physical activity in daily life may come from.Population-wide declines in physical activity (modified from Brownson et al., 2005)• Leisure-time physical activity: level or slightly increasing• Work-related activity: declining• Transportation activity: declining• Activity in the home: declining; and• Sedentary activity: increasing; therefore, total physical activity is  decliningHills argues that the role of increased energy expenditure  through  physical activity is the key to weight loss and long term  weight maintenance.The paper is available in full here  .  The relationship between decline in physical activity and weight management has been covered in several previous posts.  My own favourite is Obesity in Britain: gluttony or sloth? which examines the calorific intake in the UK diet over a 20 year period and concludes that it has declined.  They concluded that physical activity in everyday life had declined and that this was especially the case for children.Hills, A., &amp;amp; Byrne, N.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hari Singh arrived at 2am. Pisces! If he develops colic, it’s unlikely that we’ll take him to a chiropractor. Mum &amp;amp; baby doing very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Thanks to Simon’s informative Tweet, we’re able to create a rather accurate birth chart for the little guy based on his time, date, and location of birth. According to Alabe.com, the verdict is in: &lt;strong&gt;he’s going to be a bipolar psychic Libertarian asshole&lt;/strong&gt;. Full breakdown after the jump!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;img title="Hari&amp;#39;s Birth Chart" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Hari-250x300.gif" alt="Hari&amp;#39;s Birth Chart" width="250" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising Sign	is in	24 Degrees	Sagittarius&lt;br&gt;
You are known for being open, frank, outgoing and honest. At times, though, you are also &lt;strong&gt;blunt and quite indiscreet&lt;/strong&gt;. Others have to learn not to take everything you say personally, because you usually do not mean any harm. You appreciate living your life in a straightforward and simple manner — &lt;strong&gt;you dislike social niceties&lt;/strong&gt; and consider them to be hindrances to real communication. You have lots and lots of energy and &lt;strong&gt;tend to become quite restless if you feel confined&lt;/strong&gt;. You demand the freedom to do as you choose — you must be self- directed or you feel trapped and anxious. With your abundant energy, you enjoy being outdoors, and you should be attracted to physical exercise or to those forms of sport which can help you burn off some of that excess energy. &lt;strong&gt;Very gregarious, you love to socialize&lt;/strong&gt; — your innate enthusiasm livens up any gathering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(All bolding is mine.) Obviously one part of this is already quite true. Hari was confined in a womb but felt restless, so he demanded freedom and got himself born. It’s a shame that he’s going to be an indiscreet jerk, especially because his love of socializing means he’s going to be spreading that jerkiness around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun is in	29 Degrees	Pisces.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; Extremely sensitive and emotional&lt;/strong&gt;, you absorb the emotions of others (whether positive or negative) like a sponge. Emotionally vulnerable, &lt;strong&gt;you are easily upset&lt;/strong&gt; and tend to cry readily. You are at your best when you can structure your environment in such a way that you are surrounded by positive, upbeat people. You are very helpful and understanding of the needs of others. Indeed, at times this can be a disadvantage, because you can be a sucker for anyone who needs help. Shy, dreamy, romantic in nature, you delight in retreating into your private fantasy world. Just be careful that you do not get lost in it! Trust your intuitions — &lt;strong&gt;you may be quite psychic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy shit people, Simon Singh’s son might be psychic! Forget that now we know he’s a gregarious jerk who bursts into tears the moment anyone tries to get their own back. Psychic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moon is in	17 Degrees	Taurus.&lt;br&gt;
Warmth, comfort, security and familiar surroundings are necessary for you to feel at ease. Very loving and affectionate, you prefer a steady, patterned way of life. Patient, calm and steadfast, &lt;strong&gt;you are not easily upset&lt;/strong&gt;. Others look to you for support. You tend to be a slow starter and a slow mover — others may try to rush you, but they will never succeed. Emotionally, you are quite stubborn — your attitudes about people and things were firmly set in your youth and will change very little as an adult. You are also very cautious and &lt;strong&gt;conservative about spending money&lt;/strong&gt;. It is not that you are selfish, you just need to feel secure. Beware of a tendency to become overly complacent and too self-satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waaaaait just a second. Two seconds ago Hari was “easily upset.” Now he’s “not easily upset.” Could this mean . . . bipolar?? Also: he’s a cheapskate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercury is in	04 Degrees	Aries.&lt;br&gt;
Very quick-witted, you are known for being an independent thinker. &lt;strong&gt;You love to debate and argue&lt;/strong&gt;, and are excellent at repartee and battles of wits. At times, however, you act too fast on hastily formed opinions and thus waste a lot of energy defending your rash and sometimes incorrect conclusions. It is perfectly acceptable for you to defend your beliefs with your usual vigor, but try not to take the opinions of others as personal insults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably refers to the fights little psychic Hari will have with his skeptical parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venus is in	15 Degrees	Aries.&lt;br&gt;
You are a very affectionate person but you hate to be tied down. You are more than willing to be the aggressor in initiating new relationships. Indeed, once you have set your sights on someone, y&lt;strong&gt;ou tend to pursue him or her ardently and passionately&lt;/strong&gt;. But you do &lt;strong&gt;demand your own way&lt;/strong&gt; in a relationship. Try to give in to your partner’s needs and desires once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh good. A stalker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mars is in	00 Degrees	Leo.&lt;br&gt;
You are a very proud person. Strong, bold, courageous and self-possessed, you love to be the one to initiate significant actions. When people expect a lot of you, you respond positively and will work hard in order to maintain their respect. But when your dignity or pride is threatened, you tend to become &lt;strong&gt;sarcastic, arrogant and domineering&lt;/strong&gt;. Try not to take any challenge or resistance that you meet as a personal affront. You are very stubborn about your right to live your life according to your own principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More asshole behavior. Surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jupiter is in	14 Degrees	Pisces.&lt;br&gt;
You are at your best when you give of yourself and what you have — try to avoid being a martyr about it, though. You’re a true idealist, but you must learn not to be upset when life does not cooperate with the way you think things should be. Very concerned with spiritual truth and growth, when you practice what you preach, you make an excellent role model for others. You are so &lt;strong&gt;devoted to altruistic ventures and concerns&lt;/strong&gt; that you tire easily at times. It then becomes necessary for you to go off by yourself to recharge your batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least he’ll give to charity! And then tell everyone about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturn is in	01 Degrees	Libra.&lt;br&gt;
Although you take quite a while to make decisions, you usually consider all sides to a question, all the pros and cons, and the solution you come up with is very often the correct one. &lt;strong&gt;You tend to be very reserved and shy&lt;/strong&gt;, but, once you make a commitment to someone (in either a business or personal relationship), the partnership is forever. You have a strong sense of justice and fair play and greatly respect the laws and institutions by which you are governed. As such, you are outraged when others break laws or show contempt for authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, in paragraph one he was “outgoing,” “gregarious,” and loved to socialize. Now he’s reserved and shy. More indicators of bipolar behavior I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uranus is in	26 Degrees	Pisces.&lt;br&gt;
You, and most of your peers, are extremely idealistic and want to change society by &lt;strong&gt;completely reorienting its highest religious goals and aspirations&lt;/strong&gt;. Just be careful to make sure that your new goal structures are &lt;strong&gt;properly grounded in reality&lt;/strong&gt; so that they have a chance of being accepted by the majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hm, this is promising! Little Hari will grow to overturn the world’s religions and replace it with a reality-based spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neptune is in	27 Degrees	Aquarius.&lt;br&gt;
You, and your entire generation, will idealize and even venerate the ability to r&lt;strong&gt;emain detached&lt;/strong&gt; as well as the ability to &lt;strong&gt;objectively analyze any given situation&lt;/strong&gt;. There will be a concerted effort on your part to cure the ills of society as a whole. But &lt;strong&gt;be very careful to continue to maintain and protect the rights of individuals in the midst of these potentially far-reaching changes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold on. Fiscally conservative (paragraph 3), reality-based (paragraph  9) . . . oh, fuck. A Libertarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pluto is in	05 Degrees	Capricorn.&lt;br&gt;
For your entire generation, this is a period of intense changes in the very fabric of society. Many accepted institutions may pass away or be born anew. The good of the community as a whole will be stressed and &lt;strong&gt;individual rights may come under attack&lt;/strong&gt;. This will possibly be a period of decay that will lead to a &lt;strong&gt;new order&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libertarians, your society needs you! But who will lead you to victory? Who I say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;N. Node is in	18 Degrees	Capricorn.&lt;br&gt;
You rarely get involved closely with anyone unless he or she has something specific and practical to offer you. You tend to be “all business” when it comes to dealing with others. You’re usually so intently focused on a particular goal that you rarely have time for social niceties or casual fellowship. But &lt;strong&gt;you can definitely be counted on&lt;/strong&gt; by others to get things done. &lt;strong&gt;When you say that you’ll do something, you do it&lt;/strong&gt;. As such, you’re a valuable member of any team situation and &lt;strong&gt;will probably rise to a position of leadership within the group&lt;/strong&gt;. Your trustworthiness and sense of responsibility are unquestioned. But do try to avoid the temptation to “use” others to reach your goals — they might come to resent you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ciliates satisfy this weakness really nicely, as they are utterly convoluted and insane in terms of both cell and genomic organisation. Ciliates are bizzare in almost every respect possible, from their sex lives to mitoses to nuclei on crack and extremely complicated morphology, and some are even loaded with epi- and endosymbionts, have parasitic bacteria inside their nuclei and there&amp;#39;s even a couple anaerobes with reduced mitochondria. Hypotrichs are especially weird morphologically and genomically, and many have one other feature that makes them absolutely adorable: They WALK!That&amp;#39;s right, instead of swimming around like a normal flagellate must do, these creatures have thick bundles of microtubules called cirri which they use as little &amp;quot;feet&amp;quot; to walk on surfaces. One such creature, Aspidisca, apparently loves walking so much it rarely ever swims (Banchetti et al. 2003 Can J Zool)!If that scalebar were 10cm rather than 10um, Aspidisca would make such a wonderful pet! One can almost imagine what a wonderful feeling it would be to have cirri gently brush against the palm of your hand... (Rosati et al. 1987 Trans Am Microscop Soc)Aspidisca lives in marine coastal sands, which explains why it doesn&amp;#39;t really need to swim much. Like most other ciliates, it&amp;#39;s a predator, and probably not one you&amp;#39;d like to encounter if it were of our size. Also, like most, if not all, other ciliates, Aspidisca requires sex to make fresh somatic nuclei (Warning: The following figure contains porn.)Porn. Mating Aspidisca. Their macronuclei needed a little refreshing. Yes, that&amp;#39;s their cytoplasm fusion zone/tube between them. I knew you&amp;#39;d like that. (Rosati et al. 1998 Zoomorphol.)Now, hypotrichs aren&amp;#39;t just weird on the surface -- they are also utterly bizzare at heart. To them, having two differentiated nuclei, one resembling a giant bag of linear eukaryotic &amp;#39;plasmids&amp;#39; and not even doing mitosis properly, is mundane and boring. They go the extra mile and scramble their genomes. That&amp;#39;s right, instead of having your regular eukaryotic gene (interspersed with a few introns, of course), they split up fragments of their genes and mix up their order and direction. (This must really scramble the brains of the unfortunate souls forced to do bioinformatics on these organisms!)Before we go into gene scrambling, a very brief primer on ciliate genomes is in order. As you may already have heard, ciliates have a transcriptionally-silent micronucleus (MIC) and a transcriptionally-active massively polyploid bag of short chromosomes called a macronucleus (MAC). The MAC may have a ridiculous number of copies of a single chromosome, such as 9000 for some chromsomes in Tetrahymena (Yao &amp;amp; Chao 2005 Annu Rev Genet). The splitting of such nuclei during cell division is a topic worthy of a few whole posts, although I must point out that ciliates have rather insane regulation strategies for DNA replication due to the variable gene copy number after each mitosis.While the MAC sequences originate from the MIC (right after conjugation), they don&amp;#39;t actually match their MIC counterparts exactly; in fact, certain portions are deleted along their way from the MIC! Furthermore, whether a portion is retained or not depends on its presence in the old MAC, which is already destroyed by this point. There&amp;#39;s a whole epigenetic process of selected sequence deletion that&amp;#39;s also a topic for another time (you can read about it here). Essentially, you have MAC-Destined Sequences (MDS) and Internally Eliminated Sequences (IES), which are retained and excised, respectively. They kind of act like exons and introns on a genomic level. Be very careful though, as it is very easy to begin mixing up IESs and introns -- they&amp;#39;re just so alike in sound and concept, and yet so different...This mechanism of IES excision is very potent at enabling ciliate genomes to quickly fill up with junk where normal organisms wouldn&amp;#39;t tolerate it (and die off). An insertion of a random fragment into a coding region of a gene in the MIC would be non-deleterious as it would be quietly removed when the new MAC is formed. This is actually kind of annoying if one needs to insert foreign genes (eg. for GFP-tagged proteins) - adding them to the MIC would do little good, as they wouldn&amp;#39;t make it to ever be expressed. One has to either also insert the foreign gene into the MAC as well, or tweak the epigenetic IES excision mechanism with miRNAs and such. It&amp;#39;s a mess.This genome-level &amp;quot;intron&amp;quot; situation gets weirder yet: in some species, the expressed gene fragments (MDSs) are not arranged in a sensible order in the MIC! That is, if you have gene fragments 1-2-3-4 normally, you can sometimes get 2-1-3-4 or even 3-1-4-2, or some other permutation thereof. The MAC sequence remains correct: 1-2-3-4 (otherwise, the organism would die!) Furthermore, those MIC fragments can even be reversed (see above figure)! How do we get from a huge mess in the germline MIC to a regular fully functional sequence in the MAC?Unscrambling is still poorly understood, but it seems that in addition to IES removal, some form of recombination happens along the way. Furthermore, errors in the process are somehow corrected before the MAC matures. For Oxytricha ACTIN1, IESs seem to be removed before recombination and translocations (Möllenbeck et al. 2008 PLoS ONE; OA). As scrambling is slightly easier to grasp than unscrambling, a bit more seems to be understood about its evolution. It looks like gene scrambling is a fairly likely result of a system involving intricate sequence excision mechanisms, alternatively known a genome rearrangements.Real examples of scrambled genes, and models of their evolution: Left - ACTIN1 in Oxytricha.

&lt;p&gt;Someone has already PRE-WRITTEN a shopping list on the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go to my post-office box. There is a letter. It is from a fairly-well-known &lt;strong&gt;bank&lt;/strong&gt; in Australia. Nothing much, just credit-card would-I-like-to-have-more-debt nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is someone else’s shopping list on the back. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like they’re about to go on holiday? I hope they remembered their spare undies, despite posting their list to me. Vegemite, chewing gum, beach towel… maybe they’re going to a beach house? I guess it’s better than a nasty iTunes review by someone who didn’t even bother to write more than 140 characters why before they unsubscribed from Skeptic Zone? :p&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(When there’s bad reviews of the podcasts I contribute to, I usually just remind myself calmly that it hardly reflects the majority of our keen, intelligent, considerate, good-humored listeners and say out loud: “&lt;a href="http://www.27bslash6.com/easter.html"&gt;Nowhere in the Bible does Jesus have a sword-fight&lt;/a&gt;“).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? The bank did it? Or the post-master? The people who run the post-office? Why are &lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt; planning holidays when &lt;strong&gt;I’ve&lt;/strong&gt; got a room full of half-opened books, scribbled-on papers and curse-words about Libsyn filling up my Sunday afternoon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardly seems fair, quite frankly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I’ve just completed the second &lt;a href="http://www.tokenskeptic.org"&gt;Token Skeptic podcast&lt;/a&gt; episode for this week, which answers (or at least attempts to) a question posed by the wonderful, Atheist-Convention-attending OzAtheist. That’ll be up soon, called “On Women and Paranormal Belief (Part Two)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jin-ohchoi.id.au/blog/"&gt;Thanks to Jin-oh&lt;/a&gt;, I discovered that episodes one and ten were missing from my iTunes listing as well, so I’ll get moving tonight to at least get ONE of the missing episodes into filling the gap. People are irritated about those missing episodes and I can understand why and I am sorry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, rectifying that now that I am a) not gearing up to head across the country or b) getting over a cold caught on a plane or c) working on completing an article / a paper / a lesson-plan /a spreadsheet – all of which I’ll be going over, revising, starting or just plain completing tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, don’t expect much more in terms of blog-entries for me for the rest of this week, as I’ll be working on all of c).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to help, just email  your shopping lists. &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;  Nasty, unsubstantiated reviews need not apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day &lt;a href="http://www.nycskeptics.org/blog/antivaccine-movements-bad-pr-hits-critical-mass/"&gt;I wrote a lengthy piece on The Gotham Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; that addressed the numerous public defeats of the anti-vaccine movement lately in the media, in the scientific realm, and in the courtroom. And in that piece I expressed the opinion that their movement may have reached their peek last year and has begun the process of decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since writing that story, I’ve at least seen a few mainstream media stories that made me consider whether or not I’d spoken too soon. But I still don’t think that I have. And Age of Autism’s latest post by&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/09/23/age-of-projectionism/"&gt; my old friend &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/09/23/strike-2-for-jake-crosby"&gt;Jake Crosby&lt;/a&gt; seems to reinforce my original contention in the Gotham Skeptic article. If &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/chris-mooneys-pharmaceutical-influence.html"&gt;this hit piece against Chris Mooney by Crosby&lt;/a&gt; is the best they can do and is seriously what the anti-vaxxers view as a well-written and  well-reasoned article, they’re in bigger trouble than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crosby’s piece is blatantly devoid of substance. It’s one of the silliest, most asinine examples of a public hissy fit I’ve ever seen. Once again he return to his famous scare quotes around the word “Science” in name of the popular blog site ScienceBlogs. . .even though even he recognizes that Mooney writes for Discovery, not ScienceBlogs, making the constant references to ScienceBlogs pointless and inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again he makes baseless, potentially libelous conspiracy accusations without any provocation other than Mooney disagrees with him. Crosby also goes out of his way to point out that last time he criticized Mooney, Mooney never bothered to directly respond to him in a way that attempts to suggest Mooney can’t respond to him. Of course what these delusional egotists in the anti-vaccine movement fail to realize is that their empty conspiracy accusations are not worthy of a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Crosby also throws scare quotes around a bunch of other words because that’s his idea of insightful and witty commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to believe. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Crosby is a college student with Asperger Syndrome at Brandeis  University, and contributing editor to Age of Autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bow to Jake Crosby’s amazingly impressive credentials. Why can’t I lack even a Bachelor’s Degree while confidently professing greater medical knowledge than every reputable medical organization on the planet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A college RA puts inspiration quotes on the bathroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone writes on one of the posts, asking why the quotes are always from the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RA doesn’t like the tone of that question and issues a response as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4436714627_dcc39131a7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4436714627_dcc39131a7_b.jpg" title="PassiveAggressiveNote" width="550" height="733"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn… someone took that criticism a little too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the critic could’ve achieved the same result by cherry-picking a less-than-inspirational Bible quote and posting it right next to this one &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

There&amp;#39;s a wonderful paper just out in Science that sheds new light on a mystery of human behaviour: why do people sometimes do good deeds even when they gain nothing from it.Some forms of altruism can be easily explained by evolution, but evolution can&amp;#39;t explain why people are sometimes generous to completely anonymous strangers. This new study may have found a solution: it isn&amp;#39;t something inherent to our nature, but rather something that we learn to do.You might have seen something of it already - it&amp;#39;s featured on several newswires. I&amp;#39;m not going to go into detail on the headline results, because you can find them elsewhere (Wired magazine has a nice write up, for example).What interests me most about this study is the link they found religion. But first, here&amp;#39;s a quick overview of what they did, and the major finding. The heart of the study was a standard battery of economic games designed to test their subject&amp;#39;s understanding of fairness:In the &amp;#39;Dictator Game&amp;#39; Player 1 is given a fixed pool of money (equal to 1 day&amp;#39;s wages), and can share as much (or as little) as she likes with Player 2. In the &amp;#39;Ultimatum Game&amp;#39;, Player 2 is given the chance to reject offers that she feels are insultingly small.In the &amp;#39;Third Party Punishment Game&amp;#39; a third player is given some money as well, and she can spend some of it to punish Player 1, if she thinks that the offer to Player 2 is too small.Now, the logical thing to do in all these games is to hold on to all your money. You have nothing to gain by sharing (the games are anonymous), and all that happens is that you go home with less. However, what usually happens is that people do share some money (usually not 50%, however!).What makes this new study unique is that they&amp;#39;ve put together data from the world over, including the rather marvellous Hadza (you can see the locations on the map). Then they compared how much people contributed with what kind of society they lived in.They found that contributions were smallest in societies that did not have a market economy (e.g. hunter gatherers). And they found that punishment was lowest in societies formed of small groups.This potentially resolves the conundrum! What it suggests is that anonymous altruism is not part of our evolutionary make up, but instead is something that we learn from the society around us. The reason big, complex societies can exist is that we drum it into our kids that they must be fair and kind to strangers (against their natural instincts).So what&amp;#39;s the connection with religion?Well, they also showed that, in two out of the three games, the anonymous contributions were higher in those groups that had converted from tribal religions (in which gods do not enforce morality) to follow a &amp;#39;world religion&amp;#39; (in practice, either Christianity or Islam).On the face of it, this is supports the idea that &amp;#39;world religion&amp;#39; is a cultural adaptation to allow the formation of complex societies. The invention of all-seeing, morally concerned god increases the honesty in anonymous transactions, and thus allowing large, integrated communities to develop.When you look at the history of religions, it&amp;#39;s clear that the development of religious ideas has progressed in tandem with the increasing complexity of society. Robert Wright has written a book on the idea, and in the supplementary material they give a nice summary of the parallels.It all sounds very plausible. However, it&amp;#39;s not quite that simple, for a whole host of reasons.First is the problem that a &amp;#39;world religion&amp;#39; may be a cause, not a consequence, of a complex society. A world religion is essentially one that&amp;#39;s popular over large geographic area. However, the exchange of ideas that always goes together with the exchange of goods will inevitably bring about a convergence of beliefs to create a &amp;#39;world religion&amp;#39;.So you would expect a complex, diverse society to develop some kind of syncretic belief system - a &amp;#39;World Religion&amp;#39;. And that belief system would inevitably encapsulate the social norms of the complex society that created it. People create a god in their image.Suppose, for example, that countries with more parasites end up with more fractured societies that are naturally less trusting of strangers. After all, strangers could bring with them disease. Surprisingly, studies have found that this is exactly the pattern you see - people living in high parasite regions are less open to strangers and have more fractured religions (Fincher &amp;amp; Thornhill, 2008). These societies, with their tribal rather than world religions, would naturally be less co-operative in anonymous games.Perhaps moralising gods moralising gods are not required for complex societies. After all, the Romans and Greeks managed created large, complex societies despite having a pantheon of gods who were not exactly paragons of virtue.And the reality is that, in modern societies at least, non-belief is correlated with less corruption and more trust. Social norms, rather than god beliefs, seem to be of primary importance.As support for the hypothesis that &amp;#39;world religions&amp;#39; promote pro-social behaviour, they quote the work of Shariff &amp;amp; Norenzayan. That was a small study which found that, in a similar economic game, subliminal religious primes (i.e. a quick flash of a religious word) were marginally more effective in believers than non-believers.However, they also showed that non-religious primes were equally effective, and also that without the priming both religious and non-religious were equally pro-social. What&amp;#39;s more, other studies (Randolph-Seng &amp;amp; Nielsen, 2007, Ahmed 2009) have shown that pro-social effects of religion are all about the situation, rather than the beliefs.Put these findings together, and what you get is the strong suggestion that the way to encourage pro-social behaviour is to remind people about their cultural training (religious or otherwise). The more you reinforce a social norm of co-operation, the more people will co-operate.Now, that doesn&amp;#39;t rule out a role of religion in stabilising societies. In fact, I&amp;#39;m inclined to that that there must be a link. But it is fearsomely difficult to prove, and it&amp;#39;s clear that whatever the link is, it&amp;#39;s much more complicated than it appears at first sight.I&amp;#39;m going to leave you with one other niggling anomaly from the paper. Remember that &amp;#39;world  religion&amp;#39; was associated with more pro-social behaviour in only two out of the three games? Maybe you were wondering which was the one out?Well, the game that was the &amp;#39;Third Party Punishment&amp;#39; game. This is the game in which Player 1 should give more money if they fear that Player 3 might spend some cash to punish offers that were too low. It&amp;#39;s a particularly relevant test because third party intervention to enforce the rules is a crucial feature of complex society.Unlike the other two games, being Christian or Muslim had no effect on Player 1&amp;#39;s offers. What makes this doubly fascinating is that this is the only game in which wealth and income affected Player 1&amp;#39;s decisions.The authors suspect it might be that the introduction of a &amp;#39;judge&amp;#39; reduces the intrinsic motivation. In other words, the offers players make depends on what they think the judge will approve of, rather than what they themselves is fair.However, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but be reminded of another study that looked at punishment behaviour in a similar game. They examined a cross-section of relatively high income countries, and found high levels of co-operative punishment, and low-levels of anti-social punishment, in the least religious societies (Copenhagen and Melbourne).Conceivably, if you don&amp;#39;t believe that there is a god on hand to enforce the rules, you might just be motivated to do it yourself!...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

He Can See the Future:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;First and foremost I&amp;#39;m intuitive. I&amp;#39;m using that gut instinct, that third eye that we all have. I just have a heightened sense of intuition.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He can see the future.  (You know where this is going.)  But not only did this psychic douche bag not see his imminent firing, he still even now (that’s after the event, for those playing at home) doesn’t believe it’s happened:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At this time, I am not aware of any change in my business relationship with Heidi Montag&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess he can see the future but &lt;em&gt;not the past&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20120a95c0f11970b-pi"&gt;&lt;img alt="AChase" border="0" height="244" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e201310fc2ff8c970c-pi" style="border:0px none;display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" title="AChase" width="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6 align="center"&gt;Look into my eyes and repeat after me, &lt;em&gt;I have not been fired!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269131868243"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=12873">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8d97941736767ead</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">EXSMELLYARMPITS!</title><published>2010-03-21T00:01:14Z</published><updated>2010-03-21T00:01:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/exsmellyarmpits/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4af58566587f868164f2085bcbfe08d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just tweeted &lt;em&gt;“If I was Harry Potter I’d just do a spell instead of washing. EXSMELLYARMPITS!”&lt;/em&gt; which is funny because it’s a pun on a Potter-world spell, you see. Honestly, it’s funny. Anyway, it made me think of one of my favourite tweets by my bro-in-law &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/stubarb1"&gt;@stubarb1&lt;/a&gt; posted a few weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to point the finger of blame at Hogwarts but what the fuck were the wizards doing 1939 through to 1945?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes an excellent point. So while I was amusing myself thinking of this, I decided to search ‘harry potter’ on Twitter to see what other people were saying about it. Turns out there’s a Potter movie marathon on TV in the USA, so there are lots of tweets. Y’know…I’m not saying that I’m superior or anything, but I did get a giggle from these that I’m sure the authors didn’t intend. From someone called &lt;strong&gt;tresleybossdon&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watchin harry potter…im ashamed エ feel like a lame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dude…don’t watch it then. Or, watch it, feel ashamed, but don’t &lt;em&gt;tweet about it&lt;/em&gt;. That way Harry Potter can be your secret shame. Like wanking when you think about pantyhose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;strong&gt;haiderabbasi&lt;/strong&gt;, a pearl of wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Potter movies are misleading and bisexual. Books FTW!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, books for the win! Like dictionaries! For defining words like ‘misleading’ and ‘bisexual’!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am seriously hoping the extra letter in this confession from &lt;strong&gt;anythingzombie&lt;/strong&gt; is a typo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s all I have to say. Twitter status: Watching Harry Potter ’cause he’s one of my first lovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for this tweet by &lt;strong&gt;Haleighhh&lt;/strong&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese food and Harry Potter movie marathon? Oh yeaah &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…I don’t think I saw that one. Was it the movie before Harry Potter and the Cheesy Pizza? My mistake, it’s the one after this one that &lt;strong&gt;weeblesue&lt;/strong&gt; is watching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;settling in for a long night of Harry Potter and filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JK Rowling really ran out of plot ideas after a while. Fortunately, she can get advice from literary master &lt;strong&gt;mariahlamboy&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;harry potter is so eww mad weird lol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a while deciding who to give the last word to, but I think it has to be this gem from &lt;strong&gt;ANNZac&lt;/strong&gt; because the only bit I understood was ‘jizz’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worst job in the world: jizz mopper at ‘The Wizarding World of Harry Potter’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to being lighter than air, Helium is incredibly useful, scientifically, in its liquid form! With a boiling point of only 4 Kelvin, liquid helium is used to cool some of the most powerful electromagnets on Earth, including those at Fermilab and the Large Hadron Collider.

and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Judge John Deed&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ally McBeal&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;This Life&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It follows that it must be difficult to write a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;good&lt;/span&gt; courtroom drama: one where the actual trial itself provokes the interest, not the agonies or the antics of the lawyers involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And here is where I think &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrow&amp;#39;s_Law"&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Garrow's Law&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;succeeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/S6U94P900DI/AAAAAAAAAQA/7OBftAd-2Es/s1600-h/gl.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:300px;height:243px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6I0Gq-tRRHE/S6U94P900DI/AAAAAAAAAQA/7OBftAd-2Es/s320/gl.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Garrow's Law&lt;/span&gt; takes us away form the comfortable clichés of modern courtroom drama to the Old Bailey trials of the late eighteenth century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As elements of such trials were so different from those with which we are familiar - the prisoner was not able to give evidence on oath, defence representation was rare and limited, the juries conferred in the noisy courtroom and not in a discrete room, and so on - it forces the viewer to pay full attention to the trial itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have never been so engrossed in a legal drama: I watched all four episodes in one sitting last weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it does have its faults.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the characters are stock-pieces: the callow and ambitious apprentice and his wise and grumpy mentor is the central relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The production in no way conveys the bustling and noisy London poised between the ages of Hogarth and Dickens.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, it seems like London was just a park with a courtroom and a prison cell attached, with a small tavern to the side.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within the Old Bailey there appears to be one busy corridor, where somewhat inevitably the characters keep encountering each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the introduction of modern themes - such as the earnest moral majority (the dour-faced "reformation of manners" brigade), the worthy radicals (the nice sorts in the "corresponding society"), the war on terror, corruption by law-enforcers, political cover-ups - is a little clumsy and superficial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the trials themselves are genuinely fascinating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also some extremely good acting, especially &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1264521/"&gt; Aidan McArdle&lt;/a&gt; as Silvester, who can convey with a slight glance what a scriptwriter could waste a page on.  &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1203457/"&gt; Lyndsey Marshall&lt;/a&gt; also makes a good fist of playing a near-bluestocking somehow hanging around with the squares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this, and you get to see a lawyer being shot at dawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMMENTS MODERATION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No purely anonymous comments will be published;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;a href="http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/88466612.html"&gt;500 counter-protesters made a stand&lt;/a&gt; and Westboro was nowhere to be found &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/01/atheist-hits-the-streets-of-new-orleans-during-mardi-gras/"&gt;Doug Stewart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was there and took some great pics (click to expand).  He also brought along a few amusing signs of his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/General.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/General-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="General" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Kitten.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Kitten-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="Kitten" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/The-Bible.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/The-Bible-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="The Bible" width="550" height="413"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What was most amazing wasn’t merely the number of (mostly student) anti-protesters, but the sense of enjoyment, fun and frivolity that their signs portrayed. I applaud the brilliance of counteracting the hateful and nonsensical signs of “Fags Die, God Laughs,” “God Hates America,” “9-11 Gift from God,” “God Blew Up the Shuttle,” and “Pray for More Dead Soldiers,” with equally nonsensical but hilarious signs such as, “God Hates Signs,” “God Hates Homework,” “God is Lady Gaga,” “God Hates Fat Free Mayonnaise,” and “I was Promised Donuts.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug also adds one important comment about the Christians in the group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… Many of the anti-protesters didn’t get the point. Signs such as “God Bless Our Soldiers”… and “Love God, Love Your Neighbor” legitimize the Westboro message as there’s just as much evidence for “God is Love” as there is for “God Hates Fags.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to combat Westboro craziness with tongue-in-cheek silliness to lessen their threat and credibility.  But do you think Doug has a point that the anti-Westboro Christians give cover to the Westboro people by appealing to the same god?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the heels of my last blog about how many practitioners of woo are beginning to see the light of skepticism, last week’s Amazing Cruise was not only a complete blast, the likes of which many of us on board had never seen, it also provided another powerful testimony. We are making big strides. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On board was a once steeped-in-woo New Age healer, channeler and psychic; Maria Myrback.  Maria’s story is one I hope to see and hear repeated over and over in the years to come. For my part in what happened in her case, it showed me that I’m making a difference. One person at a time &lt;em&gt;can make a difference&lt;/em&gt; if we go out and &lt;strong&gt;DO SOMETHING.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit Maria’s website, &lt;a href="http://www.fledgelingskeptic.com"&gt;www.fledgelingskeptic.com&lt;/a&gt; where you can read the whole story in her own words. Maria was a woo goddess. Now she is one of us. Like Karla McLaren, (read my recent post: “Culture Clashing”) who saw my NBC special &lt;em&gt;“Secrets of the Psychics Revealed” &lt;/em&gt;and realized she was doing cold reading which led her to becoming a skeptic, Maria saw my Penn &amp;amp; Teller &lt;em&gt;“Bullshit”&lt;/em&gt; episode, &lt;em&gt;“Talking to the Dead,”&lt;/em&gt;and realized that what she was doing was wrong. She’s now a skeptical convert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:102px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/anita1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="anita" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/anita1.jpg" alt="" width="92" height="116"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anita&amp;#39;s a Skeptic Now Too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is out that one-time $50,000 IIG claimant Anita Ikonen is also in the throes of a skeptical transformation. Those of us who have gotten to know Anita a little will reserve our judgements until more information is available, but in a conversation I had with her over lunch on the day the IIG tested Regan Traynor, she confessed that she was in the process of considering a recantation of her popular book about breatharianism and spilling the beans about what a bunch of nonsense that whole part of her life was (when she was known as “Alenara.”) We are all waiting on that one. Some stripes are harder to change than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When woo gets skeptical, everybody wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Mariame.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Maria &amp;amp; Me" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Mariame-225x168.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria &amp;amp; Me &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take a little time to see the results, but if you are willing to take a stand, skeptics, rational thinkers and even a few on the fence can be effective in changing the mess we are in. There is no doubt in my mind that Karla, Maria and Anita are only the tip of an iceberg that is slowly thawing. Knowing I have been a part of these transformations is uplifting. I’m now re-invigorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Randi.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="Randi" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Randi-225x168.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randi &amp;amp; Maria Exchange Amazements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hear Maria tell me that I inspired this change for the better in her life made the Amazing Cruise even more amazing. This was a week I will remember. The camaraderie and inspiration was tremendous and the promise of fantastic new things to come from JREF, CFI and the grassroots movement was as exhilarating as the bracing sea air and the bright blue waters of Grand Turk Island. Maria gracefully accepted the Silver Ship Award from Jeff Wagg for her detremination and committment to skepticism and all were delieghted by her soft spoken demeanor.&lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/maria21.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="maria2" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/maria21-225x295.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="295"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will comment more on The Amazing Cruise later on down the line. &lt;strong&gt;FORCE ONE &lt;/strong&gt;managed to gain a few more operatives and I found out there are some very interesting underground hush hush deals underway that are extremely provocative. If you are one of the lurkers from the Vent/Browne/Coffey crowd – watch your backs. We are planning on more proactive premptive actions against the bottom-feeders out there and we will be bringing it to their doors, not waiting for them to sign on for a challenge or an investigation. The gloves are coming off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure Brian Dunning will be posting something about it here and there are literally THOUSANDS of photos blossoming all over Facebook and elsewhere online if you look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Wagg’s Rational Alchemy podcast we did on board was a high point for many of us and should be available at &lt;a href="http://www.rationalalchemy.com"&gt;www.rationalalchemy.com&lt;/a&gt; soon. Check it out. It was marvelous.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s very strong, and very green. But is it something more?I used to think so, until I came across this paper taking a skeptical look at the history and science of the drink, Padosch et al&amp;#39;s Absinthism a fictitious 19th century syndrome with present impactAbsinthe is prepared by crushing and dissolving the herb wormwood in unflavoured neutral alcohol and then distilling the result; other herbs and spices are added later for taste and colour.It became extremely popular in the late 19th century, especially in France, but it developed a reputation as a dangerous and hallucinogenic drug. Overuse was said to cause insanity, &amp;quot;absinthism&amp;quot;, much worse than regular alcoholism. Eventually, absinthe was banned in the USA and most but not all European countries.Much of the concern over absinthe came from animal experiments. Wormwood oil was found to cause hyperactivity and seizures in cats and rodents, whereas normal alcohol just made them drunk. But, Padosch et al explain, the relevance of these experiments to drinkers is unclear, because they involved high doses of pure wormwood extract, whereas absinthe is much more dilute. The fact that authors at the time used the word absinthe to refer to both the drink and the pure extract added to the confusion.It&amp;#39;s now known that wormwood, or at least some varieties of it, contains thujone, which can indeed cause seizures, and death, due to being a GABA antagonist. Until a few years ago it was thought that old-style absinthe might have contained up to 260 mg of thujone per litre, a substantial dose.But that was based on the assumption that all of the thujone in the wormwood ended up in the drink prepared from it. Chemical analysis of actual absinthe has repeatedly found that it contains no more than about 6 mg/L thujone. The alcohol in absinthe would kill you long before you drank enough to get any other effects. As the saying goes, &amp;quot;the dose makes the poison&amp;quot;, something that is easily forgotten.As Padosch et al point out, it&amp;#39;s possible that there are other undiscovered psychoactive compounds in absinthe, or that long-term exposure to low doses of thujone does cause &amp;quot;absinthism&amp;quot;. But there is no evidence for that so far. Rather, they say, absinthism was just chronic alcoholism, and absinthe was no more or less dangerous than any other spirit.I&amp;#39;m not sure why, but drinks seem to attract more than their fair share of urban myths. Amongst many others I&amp;#39;ve heard that the flakes of gold in Goldschläger cause cuts which let alcohol into your blood faster; Aftershock crystallizes in your stomach, so if you drink water the morning afterwards, you get drunk again; and that the little worm you get at the bottom of some tequilas apparently contains especially concentrated alcohol, or hallucinogens, or even cocaine maybe.Slightly more serious is the theory that drinking different kinds of drinks instead of sticking to just one gets you drunk faster, or gives you a worse hangover, or something, especially if you do it in a certain order. Almost everyone I know believes this, although in my drinking experience it&amp;#39;s not true, but I&amp;#39;m not sure that it&amp;#39;s completely bogus, as I have heard somewhat plausible explanations i.e. drinking spirits alongside beer leads to a concentration of alcohol in your stomach that&amp;#39;s optimal for absorption into the bloodstream... maybe.Link: Not specifically related to this but The Poison Review is an excellent blog I&amp;#39;ve recently discovered all about poisons, toxins, drugs, and such fun stuff.Padosch SA, Lachenmeier DW, &amp;amp; Kröner LU (2006).

Being new to skepticism (as in active skepticism as opposed to driving his wife around to do skeptical things) and not a seasoned debater, he did his best to hold his own but made some rookie mistakes. He tried to address every red herring thrown at him and within 9 comments the discussion went from Evolution vs. Creationism to murder, morality, Hitler, 9/11, the existence of God and war. I felt dizzy from watching the debate whip around and devolve into what I can only imagine Facebook would look like if Ben Stein’s brain barfed on my friend feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could have been a calm discussion about science and a chance to teach someone the difference between propaganda and fact ended with two friends walking away happily disagreeing on philosophy.

&lt;p&gt;I don’t blame my lover face, though. Years of skepticism and active discussions on the topic of evolution and studying the tactics and talking points of the ID crowd have taught me how to deal with these people, and I don’t even do it particularly well compared to most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What advice would you give an unseasoned debater or a fledgling skeptic for when they unexpectedly encounter The Opposition® in conversation? How would you have handled the situation in Brian’s shoes? And, if you were me, would you have been able to resist the temptation to jump in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.basics-london.org/whatis.htm"&gt;BASICS London &lt;/a&gt;is a group of doctors who give immediate, on the spot care to victims of accidents, medical emergencies, and disasters. The service is voluntary and unpaid, and we are on call 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Over the last 25 years we have built up a very close relationship with London Ambulance Service, London Fire Brigade, and the Metropolitan Police Service.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The bulk of our work is in helping casualties of road traffic collisions, especially those who are trapped and seriously injured. We are also called to give immediate medical care to people who have become critically ill through medical problems or trauma. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The blogger calls himself RapidResponceDoc (or RRD). He's making &lt;a href="http://basicsdoc.blogspot.com/2010/03/100000-visits-now-its-your-turn_19.html"&gt;a fundraising appeal:

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BASICS-London is a charity. It costs a lot of money to put a doctor on the street, and every penny comes from donations. The doctors themselves get no payment for the work they do, and pay for the extra fuel, insurance and wear-and-tear on the vehicle out of their own pockets. Each doctor needs blue light driver training (£1000), modifications to their car (£1500), personal protective equipment for themselves (£1200) and the necessary medical equipment to save lives (over £10,000). All of the doctors currently on the road have the first 2, most cadge some form of protective equipment, and few have all the necessary equipment needed. There are currently 15 active doctors in London and the surrounding regions. Many more are standing in the wings, waiting to be trained and equipped.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recall that this foundation was set up by Francis Collins and its mission is very clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The BioLogos Foundation is a group of Christians, many of whom are professional scientists, biblical scholars, philosophers, theologians, pastors, and educators, who are concerned about the long history of disharmony between the findings of science and large sectors of the Christian faith. We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God. We also believe that evolution, properly understood, best describes God’s work of creation. Founded by Dr. Francis Collins, BioLogos addresses the escalating culture war between science and faith, promoting dialog and exploring the harmony between the two. We are committed to helping the church – and students, in particular – develop worldviews that embrace both of these complex belief structures, and that allow science and faith to co-exist peacefully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BioLogos represents the harmony of science and faith. It addresses the central themes of science and religion and emphasizes the compatibility of Christian faith with scientific discoveries about the origins of the universe and life.  To communicate this message to the general public and add to the ongoing dialog, The BioLogos Foundation created BioLogos.org.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Got it? This is a group of people who think that science and religion (e.g. evangelical Christianity, Roman Catholicism) are compatible with science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Ruse's essay fits right in to this theme [&lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/accommodationist-and-proud-of-it-part-i/"&gt;Accommodationist and Proud of It, Part I&lt;/a&gt;] Problem is, Ruse doesn't understand why he's an accommodationist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;And yet, I am excoriated at every turn. Why? Simply, because I am an “Accommodationist.” I think that some kind of intellectual meeting is possible with religious believers, including Christian religious believers. As it happens, I believe that in America it is tremendously important politically to bring evolutionists together with people of religious commitment, but I absolutely and completely would not argue for a position that I thought wrong because it was politically expedient to do so. I would not say that emotion plays no role in my position. It does indeed. That helps me to take a stand that I think right against folk with whom I would much rather be a friend than a scorned enemy. But I think one can make a sound case for the position I have taken and still accept strongly today. In this essay, I try to explain what I believe and why I believe it. Why I am an “Accommodationist,” whatever that might mean, and proud of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please understand: this piece I am writing now is not so much a response as a reaction. What I mean by this is that I don’t want to whine about being mistreated or misunderstood or whatever. As I have already intimated, in a way to respond in such a way would be almost hypocritical, because I rather like the fact that I stir people up so much that they want to strike out as they do. But I think there is some value in trying to see where I have come from, what I believe at the moment, and why I have fallen out (or raised the ire of, because frankly it was not I who started the quarrel) of people who in most respects you would think would be my natural allies. I am going to write this in a rather personal way because above all it is rather personal. I think, however, even those of you who think writers should never reveal anything of themselves will be able to strain through the personal and see the arguments underneath.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh dear! Ruse  is terribly confused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accommodationist term was made up to describe atheists who go out of their way to defend religious beliefs as being compatible with science.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; They claim that religion is a way of knowing separate from science. They claim that science can't investigate the important claim of religion so it's perfectly okay to be a scientist and, at the same time, believe in life after death, miracles, and humans who are the son of God. They are accommodationsts because they pretend there's no conflict between science and many religious beliefs.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accommodationists are NOT defined as people who have Christian friends and who are willing to ally with their friends on common causes like keeping creationism out of the schools. Those are traits shared by those of us who believe that science and religion are incompatible. Believe it or not, I have friends who believe in God and so does PZ Myers and Richard Dawkins. (I suspect Jerry Coyne probably has such friends as well.) Bringing that up only confuses the issue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't believe that Ruse is ignorant of this distinction because he's written many articles about the compatibility of science and religion. Is he being deliberately misleading on the BioLogos website?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps he'll clarify this point and demonstrate that he understands the difference between being an accommodationist and being a friend and ally of people who believe in the supernatural. There are going to be more essays, but you can skip Part II [&lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/accommodationist-and-proud-of-it-part-ii-a-christian-childhood/"&gt;Accommodationist and Proud of It, Part II: A Christian Childhood&lt;/a&gt;]. There's nothing worth reading there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. Michael Ruse complains a lot about being misunderstood. The remedy is not to blame his opponents—although we are rarely blameless—but to try and write more clearly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[HatTip: Jerry Coyne - &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/weekend-accommodationism/"&gt;Weekend Accommodationism&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. They were originally called Neville Chamberlain Evolutionists, as Ruse points out in his article. That term has been dropped but you get the idea. Accommodationists describe otherwise intelligent atheists/evolutionists who compromise their principles when it comes to dealing with the beliefs of some (but not all) believers. They do this in order to maintain the peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-5641268759989610054?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269112008623"><id gr:original-id="http://sciencetrio.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/wolf-recovery-vs-ecosystem-health-2/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62e19a5877732ee9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Wolf recovery vs. ecosystem health</title><published>2010-03-20T14:00:41Z</published><updated>2010-03-20T14:00:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/Uo9stFt-CCU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://sciencetrio.wordpress.com/2010/03/20/wolf-recovery-vs-ecosystem-health-2/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The idea may be exotic to many wolf conservation advocates, but a group of researchers are floating a proposal to introduce very small groups of wolves to small pieces of habitat as a management tool.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; The woman was trapped in her car unconscious for about 20 minutes while firefighters performed an extraction, he said. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;And alert Language Log reader Diane commented: "I had no idea our firefighters were also trained at dentistry!"  She also asked me whether the misleading phrase &lt;i&gt;an extraction&lt;/i&gt; was a dangler (an analog of the dangling modifier that prescriptivists warn against).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It isn't, despite the fact that we are not directly given a logical subject for the implicit reference to extracting. &lt;i&gt;An extraction&lt;/i&gt; is a noun phrase (NP) functioning as direct object of the verb &lt;i&gt;performed&lt;/i&gt;, and a direct object &lt;b&gt;never&lt;/b&gt; needs a predicand (or "logical subject", i.e., an NP it can act as a predicate of). It's only predicative adjuncts that can be danglers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible, though, for a predicative adjunct to consist of nothing but an NP.  That occurs in &lt;i&gt;A skilled fireman, Dan didn&amp;#39;t take long to get the woman out of the vehicle&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;Dan&lt;/i&gt; is the predicand so we understand that Dan is being described as a skilled fireman. But such an NP can also be a dangler, as in &lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;A skilled fireman, things didn&amp;#39;t take long&lt;/i&gt;, which sounds deeply weird because you aren't told &lt;b&gt;who&lt;/b&gt; is a skilled fireman.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane is of course quite right that the sentence in the &lt;i&gt;Citizen&lt;/i&gt; sounds extremely silly.  I actually think it's a case of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=nerdview"&gt;nerdview&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;perform an extraction&lt;/i&gt; must be how fire station record books and regulation manuals would refer to getting trapped women out of crushed vehicles.  A reporter with sense would have translated the nerviewese and said "The woman was trapped in her car unconscious for about 20 minutes while firefighters got her out."&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Chris Mooney’s Pharmaceutical Influence

By Jake Crosby

He is the drug industry’s newer, trendier go-to guy in the media, replacing the role of Arthur Allen, who took a break to write about tomatoes. An ex-patriot of “Science”Blogs who now blogs for Discover, and contributing editor to Science Progress, Chris Mooney is perhaps Pharma’s newest writer who has taken on the task of spoon-feeding its message to the public.
From there it is smears all the way down. You can read the whole thing here. My favorite sentence:
Yet despite the previously described mingling with obvious denialists and plagiarists, Chris Mooney is perhaps most notorious in the autism community....
You complete the sentence. But make sure to include the word "Pharma" at least twice....

PS: Orac has more on Jake Crosby's endeavors.....written pretty kindly, as I think this particular case deserves.&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F03%2F20%2Fdelightful-smears-from-the-anti-vaccine-folks%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269103827265"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/?p=13057">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f86bf4b232bdc54</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Science"/><category term="vernal equinox"/><title type="html">Fakequinox</title><published>2010-03-20T16:30:08Z</published><updated>2010-03-20T16:30:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BadAstronomyBlog/~3/LmYv6AK6TuE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/20/fakequinox/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, March 20, &lt;a href="http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/data-services/earth-seasons"&gt;at 17:32 GMT&lt;/a&gt; (1:32 p.m. EST) — after three months of crawling northward — the center of the Sun will lie on the celestial equator, heralding the moment of the vernal equinox.&lt;/p&gt;

His particular interest is the flow of time, and why it goes from the past to the future. That may seem like a weird thing, but in fact we don’t understand why we remember the past and not the future. Space goes in all directions, but time is a one-way street. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is so interesting, in fact, that it caught the attention of noted scientist and thinker Stephen Colbert, who discussed it (and Sean’s new book, &lt;em&gt;From Eternity to Here&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/03/10/report-from-colbert/"&gt;on his TV show last week&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend taking a look at the clip Sean has on his blog; he’s a great example of not only someone trying to pry open the secrets of everything, but also of someone who enjoys doing it, and does a great job explaining it under what must be the high-pressure gaze of Colbert. My congrats to Sean for joining &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/10/29/cox-on-colbert/"&gt;the long list of my friends&lt;/a&gt; who have been on that TV show, and of course I’m not jealous &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. Really. Not even a little tiny bit. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of times, it’s just a petty scam and people lose only money as a result.  Sometimes, it’s much more tragic and lives are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, it was reported that an Indian couple couldn’t conceive a child, so they went to a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantrik"&gt;tantrik&lt;/a&gt; who told them &lt;em&gt;they needed to &lt;a href="http://www.ndtv.com/news/cities/5-young-children-sacrificed-by-couple-17940.php"&gt;kill 11 children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to fix the problem.  They went to work immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Between December 13 and March 4, five boys aged between two and four years were poisoned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I’m sure there were scientific reasons they couldn’t conceive, they ignored or were unaware of them.  Why?  Maybe because of a lack of education or a misguided trust in religious superstition.  In any case, they instead looked to a deranged hack who told them murder was the solution to their dilemma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Indians are fighting back against this pervasive woo taking over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanal Edamaruku&lt;/strong&gt; has been a leader in this field as head of the &lt;a href="http://www.indianrationalists.blogspot.com/"&gt;Indian Rationalists’ Association&lt;/a&gt;, which now has over 100,000 members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, a “famous tantric guru” said he could kill someone using &lt;em&gt;only his mind&lt;/em&gt;.  So &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7067989.ece"&gt;Edamaruku took him up on the offer&lt;/a&gt;.  On live television, &lt;strong&gt;Pandit Surender Sharma&lt;/strong&gt; was given the opportunity to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
First, the master chanted mantras, then he sprinkled water on his intended victim. He brandished a knife, ruffled the sceptic’s hair and pressed his temples. But after several hours of similar antics, Mr Edamaruku was still very much alive — smiling for the cameras and taunting the furious holy man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the guru’s initial efforts failed, he accused Mr Edamaruku of praying to gods to protect him. “No, I’m an atheist,” came the response. The holy man then said he needed to conduct a ritual that could only be done at night, outdoors, and after he had slept with a woman, drunk alcohol and rubbed himself in ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men agreed to go to an outdoor studio that night — all to no avail. At midnight, the anchor declared the contest over. Reason had prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The immediate goal I have is to stop these fraudulent babas and gurus,” says Mr Edamaruku, 55, a part-time journalist and publisher from the southern state of Kerala. “I want people to make their own decisions. They should not be guided by ignorance, but by knowledge.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just watch this video of the event.  Watch the smile on Edamaruku’s face as he proves the “master” is indeed a fraud:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/NpwCuv_izn4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master’s “mental death waves” somehow included the need for an open knife, water, and physically touching Edamaruku.  And he still failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need more men and women like Edamaruku leading the way to expose these frauds.  Don’t just stop at the obviously crazy people, either.  Expose the monks and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhu"&gt;sadhus and sadhvis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The sooner people realize these “people of god” have no real power, the more quickly the whole country will be enlightened.&lt;/p&gt;

Samanta et al. claimed to have contradicted a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5850/612"&gt;2007 paper by Scott Saleska et al.&lt;/a&gt;, and to have thereby overturned some IPCC conclusions. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis showed why Samanta’s paper did not contradict the IPCC, even if it may have correctly identified an error in Saleska et al.  Now Saleska has written to say that, actually, Samanta et al.’s results do not identify any error in their work: the results agree completely.  With our apologies for the journalistic whiplash, Simon Lewis and I are convinced he’s right.  The more general point though, is that the the balance of evidence shows that the Amazon is sensitive to drought, and the IPCC’s statements about it remain valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is Saleska’s commentary in full&lt;br&gt;
——-&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Guest Commentary by Scott Saleska, University of Arizona&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of the Lewis post (“Up is Down, Brown is Green”) is perhaps even more true than the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/03/up-is-down-brown-is-green-with-apologies-to-orwell/"&gt;insightful commentary by my colleague Simon Lewis&lt;/a&gt; indicates!   The  &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2009GL042154.shtml"&gt;Samanta et al paper&lt;/a&gt; says brown, but in fact their own data (when you dig it out of the supplement) shows green, consistent with (and indeed virtually indistinguishable from) our original findings published in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5850/612"&gt;Saleska et al., 2007&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samanta et al. misrepresents our work on many levels (one of which is to assert, falsely, that we did not filter out atmosphere-corrupted observations when in fact we did), and we intend, of course, to present an appropriate response in the peer reviewed literature, where the technical details of our differences may be evaluated by anyone who wishes.  But for the moment we will, for the sake of argument, accept their analysis at face value and ask:  even if Samanta et al. are 100% correct in their critique of our methods (which we of course dispute), what are the implications?  Does the alternative to our method which Samanta et al. advocate, or the recent update in the MODIS satellite data (to version 5 from version 4), make any difference for the main conclusion of our paper?  With due respect to our friends and colleagues at Boston University, the answer is no, it does not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First:  the actual relevant Samanta et al data (which comes from their Supplement, Table S3) is this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" align="right" width="380" style="margin-left:1em"&gt;

In other words, the Samanta et al data contradict the Samanta et al text and title (which states that Amazon forests did not green up):  not only do forests in the drought region green up, they green up alot, more than any other year since the MODIS satellite sensor was launched.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, how does this compare to Saleska et al. (2007), which Samanta et al claim to rebut?  Here are the numbers (again, taken directly from Samanta et al, Table S3 and Saleska et al., 2007):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraction of valid pixels in the 2005 drought region that are “green” (&amp;gt; + 1 Standard deviation)&lt;br&gt;
Saleska et al. (2007):   34%  (p&amp;lt;0.000001)&lt;br&gt;
Samanta et al. (2010): 32%  (p&amp;lt;0.004)        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that their observed 2005 result (32% greenness) is indistinguishable from ours (34%).  I.e. Samanta et al effectively reproduce the results of Saleska et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summary response, of course, begs some very interesting questions about tropical forest function under climatic variability and change (indeed the most interesting questions of all!):  what caused the anomalously disproportionate green-up in the drought region?   And, even if satellite “green up” does in fact represent an increase in photosynthesis (as we think), could this in fact be a symptom of the trees compensating for the increased stress of the drought?   The bottom line “carbon balance” of a tree depends on both photosynthetic uptake and respiratory losses, and it is almost certainly the case that those losses (which were not seen by the satellite) increased under the hotter and drier conditions of the drought as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the most intriguing idea to me is that the short-term satellite-detected green-up, and the longer term increase in net carbon loss reported in the Phillips et al paper (discussed by Simon Lewis) are not in conflict at all.  It might well be that they represent different parts of a coherent forest response to drought, in which the longer term losses are larger than the satellite-detected attempt to compensate for them by increasing photosynthesis, and in the end, increased tree mortality is the result.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion I would like to reinforce Simon’s point about Samanta et al and the IPCC.  More important than whatever they say about our one short paper, Samanta et al. truly and egregiously misrepresent the implications, of both their work and ours, when they claim that a single paper on short term vegetation response somehow rebuts the IPCC’s review of the large scientific literature on how Amazonia might respond to long-term shifts in the mean climate state.  It is an illogical and misguided claim on many levels, one that is already and deservedly attracting the opprobrium of many of my colleagues, talented scientists who  study Amazon forests and climate (see &lt;a href="http://www.whrc.org/assets/scientists_amazon_response.pdf"&gt;Scientists speak: Amazon “myths” are not debunked&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In sum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Samanta et al data show a drought region green up that is on average indistinguishable from Saleska et al (but they call it NO green up).&lt;br&gt;
– Samanta et al data almost exactly reproduce Saleska et al’s most salient bottom-line result (but they say what we did was not reproducible).&lt;br&gt;
– the Samanta et al paper, based on a three-month drought response, says not one word about long-term climate change scenarios reviewed in IPCC (but they advertise their analysis as “reject[ing] claims” put forward by the IPCC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>eric</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269097142389"><id gr:original-id="http://podblack.com/?p=2866">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/020a6bc427e7116f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All About Me"/><category term="Australia"/><category term="Blogroll"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Events"/><category term="Links Elsewhere"/><category term="Media"/><category term="Podcasting"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="travel"/><category term="Chaser"/><category term="comedy"/><category term="Episode Thirteen"/><category term="interview"/><category term="Julian Morrow"/><category term="libel reform"/><category term="news"/><category term="podcast"/><category term="Simon Singh"/><category term="skeptic zone"/><category term="teaser"/><category term="Token Skeptic"/><title type="html">Lucky Thirteen Token Skeptic Now Out!</title><published>2010-03-20T14:58:52Z</published><updated>2010-03-20T14:58:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PodblackCat/~3/Q3U3Litn8yI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://podblack.com/2010/03/lucky-thirteen-token-skeptic-now-out/"/><content xml:base="http://podblack.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Picture-11.png" alt="" width="293" height="145"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Completely unrelated – but congratulations to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SLSingh/status/10775494685"&gt;Simon Singh and family, with the arrival of little Hari!&lt;/a&gt; After the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/12/simon-singh-goodbye-libel-reform"&gt;tragic news about quitting his Guardian column (’This is Goodbye’)&lt;/a&gt;, this is great news.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I interviewed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Morrow"&gt;Julian Morrow of the Chaser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/julian-morrow/"&gt;, who featured at the Saturday night dinner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chaser"&gt;The Chaser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is an Australian satirical comedian group, most famous for their television programmes on Australian Broadcasting Corporation. &lt;a href="http://www.chaser.com.au/"&gt;The Chaser&lt;/a&gt; originated as a satirical newspaper which was known to push the limits as to what it published and for enacting its mission statement, “striving for mediocrity in a world of excellence”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full interview (since this is only a segment of a larger interview) will feature in a forthcoming episode on the &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Skeptic Zone podcast&lt;/a&gt;. This is just a little thanks to everyone who showed support and to commemorate the wonderful experience I had taking part in the convention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sunday, January 17 at 9-10:05am 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Science online talks between generations&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/blugger" title=""&gt;Beatrice Lugger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/PM_09_Nobel_Laureate_Meeting_2009__Follow_the_Proceedings_Online.AxCMS" title=""&gt;Christian Rapp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: In huge meetings around the world several organizations try to initiate a dialogue between top scientists and young researchers -the &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de"&gt;Lindau Meetings of Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; are one of them providing numerous opportunities for an exchange of ideas and thoughts between young researchers and Nobel Laureates. The idea is to support this dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. We'd like to discuss how one can initiate a continued communication process even between two meetings. Which internet/social web tools might be useful to bridge the communication habits of a younger generation with that of an older generation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is if one can organize such a dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get some impressions of the Lindau Nobel Laureates meeting itself please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/WebHome.AxCMS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, click through the archives, read in the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/MeetingReports.AxCMS"&gt;annual reports&lt;/a&gt; and take a look at the actual list of &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de/PublicParticipants.AxCMS?Meeting=278&amp;amp;Usergroup=6742"&gt;Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; who are expected to join the next meeting (the participation list of young researchers will be online by the end of April 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to promote the scientific communication between generations. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/video/lindau2009/index.html"&gt;Five short films&lt;/a&gt; presented by Nature Video, show some kinds of such a dialogue. Join Laureates and young researchers as they discuss the future of medicine, consider the ethics of nanotechnologies, plan new collaborations, and seek ways to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely there also exists a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/2009/06/exemplifying-apprenticeship-the-lindau-meetings.php"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting and we are acitve on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/LindauNobelLaureatesMeeting"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lindaunobel"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Till now the traffic on these plattforms abruptly drops down after the meetings and grows up some weeks before the next one. We'd like to find new ways to encourage a continuous dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The first is a boilerplate pre-packaged message informing you that I have entered your address on my website as my temporary address for two or three days later this month, and I have let my employers know that people can call me or fax me at your house.  I'm a complete stranger to you, except that you know my name from Language Log; I have obtained your email address from public sources, and pre-emptively set up arrangements to that assume I'll be staying with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second of the two emails is personally addressed, and says that I'll be in your area later this month to give a lecture, and since I'm on a tight budget, would it be all right if I came to stay for two nights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take it you'd be somewhere between insulted and shocked, despite the fact that it is sort of flattering that a famous Language Log writer has singled you out as a person he would like to stay with.  Well the equivalent not only happened to me today; it happens to me every couple of months.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the blue comes an email telling me that my name has been added to a database of manuscript referees — academics who can be called upon to supply donated time reviewing papers submitted for publication. Then shortly &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; that comes a personal message from an editor (often a total stranger to me), asking me if I'd be so kind as to do a favor by reviewing a manuscript that has been submitted on some topic that I know about.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every time my involuntary reaction is the same: repulsion, even anger, at the sheer rudeness of it.  Despite the fact that a famous journal has singled me out as an expert they would like an opinion from.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here&amp;#39;s the latest example, with journal, location, and editor&amp;#39;s name disguised to protect the not-particularly innocent.  First, message number 1:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 20-Mar-2010  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now for message number 2:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;tt&gt; From onbehalfof+xxxxxx.wwwww.yyyy.zz@manuscriptcentral.com  Sat Mar 20 07:27:26 2010&lt;br&gt;Date: Sat, 20 Mar 2010 03:27:19 -0400 (EDT)&lt;br&gt;From: xxxxxx@wwwww.yyyy.zz&lt;br&gt;Subject: Journal of Wwwww - Invitation to Review Manuscript  ID JWWW-2010-0041  &lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 20-Mar-2010  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dear Geoff (if I may):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The above manuscript, entitled "On the snrdpql vbrh of frueqbd sjhdpbc" has been submitted to Journal of Wwwww.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We would be grateful if you would kindly agree to act as a reviewer for this paper.  The abstract appears at the end of this letter… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that the first message was sent off 59 seconds before the second.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The culprit is not necessarily the well-meaning editor Professor Xxxxxx, who I have heard of but not met, or any of the staff of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Wwwww&lt;/i&gt;, which I have seen but am not antecedently involved with.  Quite probably it is a suite of standard editorial software, owned by the huge Thomson Reuters global publishing empire, once called Manuscript Central and apparently now renamed &lt;a href="http://scholarone.com/products/manuscript/"&gt;ScholarOne Manuscripts&lt;/a&gt;. It is "the proven industry leader" in editorial discourtesy, designed as  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; an innovative, web-based, submission and peer review workflow solution for scholarly publishers. Easy-to-configure, it allows for streamlined administrative, editing and reviewing capabilities.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScholarOne serves more than 365 societies and publishers, over 3,400 books and journals, and 13 million registered users.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ScholarOne Manuscripts reduces time to decision, eliminates paper distribution costs, decreases administrative overhead and increases submissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So there are 13 million of us exploited reviewers!  And in almost all cases, it seems, we were first informed that we had been press-ganged and entered into naval personnel records and issued with a sailor's uniform, and only then, a minute later, politely asked by the captain of the ship if we would be prepared to serve the navy as an ordinary seaman for zero pay.  If hardly anyone else in academia has ever been offended by this, then I guess there must be way over 12.99 million people out there who are much more tolerant than I am.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the software would have to do is to ensure that the default behavior is to &lt;b&gt;send the polite request first&lt;/b&gt;, and send out the login name and password only later, after receiving a reply.  That wouldn't seem presumptuous and annoying at all.  I'm prepared to believe that it just might have been Professor Xxxxxx's fault: he could have had two tasks to execute and pressed the buttons in the wrong order.  The reason I suspect the software design is that this has been done to me so often: the defaults must be such that this is the behavior resulting from the most natural way of using the program.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How could anyone design software with defaults so stupid?  How could anyone (let alone a linguist) not notice this gross violation of polite discourse?  You don't tell someone &lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt; that you have already been put in the database and given an account name and assigned some password that they didn't choose, and append a whole lot of terse instructions about what their duties will be in their new non-paying job, and &lt;b&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; ask them to agree to do this favor!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So my policy now (since I really have too much to do, and some things have to go) is that I refuse refereeing requests when they arrive in this way.  And from now on I will do it by sending the editor a link to this post.  I'm sorry if this makes me seem unpleasantly grouchy, but I find these you-have-been-added messages unpleasantly rude. There may be 13 million people out there who tolerate this kind of discourtesy, but they aren't going to include me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[If you would like to comment below, please do so.  Notice that if you have never commented before, you have &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; already been entered into our database of commenters, and &lt;b&gt;you&lt;/b&gt; will choose your own identifying name and supply your email address.  (Don't forget that email address, because I may need to get in touch about coming to stay with you for a few days.)]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added two days later:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For those of you whose reaction is "Oh, what's the big deal, why not just ignore the email?", let me say that (as I expected) I have now had further unwanted correspondence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Professor Geoffrey Pullum:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, we invited you to review the above manuscript, entitled "On the snrdpql vbrh of frueoabd sjhdpbc." we have yet to hear from you about this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This e-mail requests that you respond to the invitation to review. We very much appreciate your help in accomplishing our goal of having an expedited reviewing process.  Thank you for your time and trouble.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agreed: http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/wwww?URL_MASK=3D5h78kQ359×64RHR22Z4  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declined: http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/wwww?URL_MASK=3DFc8jFQ2H8cf3RX5bJ  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will now get emails for the rest of my life bugging me about a job I was never even asked if I would &lt;b&gt;consider&lt;/b&gt; taking on.  It's like a collection agency starting to bug you about an unpaid bill for a purchase you were never even invited to make.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/accommodationist-and-proud-of-it-part-i/"&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; is an extended whine on Ruse’s mistreatment by people like Richard Dawkins, P. Z. Myers, and me.  He’s still harping on the moniker that P.Z. hung on him: “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/06/in_which_andrew_brown_gets_eve.php"&gt;clueless gobshite.”&lt;/a&gt; (Ruse must have mentioned this a dozen times in the last year–see &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/02/atheism-dawkins-ruse"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/why-i-think-the-new-atheists-are-a-bloody-disaster.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for example). I won’t go as far as P.Z.  The clueless gobshitery is not incessant—it’s evident mainly when Ruse is discussing science and faith, which is only about 65% of the time.  Like this time. From his essay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, I am excoriated at every turn.  Why?  Simply, because I am  an “Accommodationist.”  I think that some kind of intellectual meeting  is possible with religious believers, including Christian religious  believers.  As it happens, I believe that in America it is tremendously  important politically to bring evolutionists together with people of  religious commitment, but I absolutely and completely would not argue  for a position that I thought wrong because it was politically expedient  to do so.  I would not say that emotion plays no role in my position.   It does indeed.  That helps me to take a stand that I think right  against folk with whom I would much rather be a friend than a scorned  enemy.  But I think one can make a sound case for the position I have  taken and still accept strongly today.  In this essay, I try to explain  what I believe and why I believe it.  Why I am an “Accommodationist,”  whatever that might mean, and proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand: this piece I am writing now is not so much a  response as a reaction.  What I mean by this is that I don’t want to  whine about being mistreated or misunderstood or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he doesn’t want to whine, why is he always doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part II deals with his &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/blog/accommodationist-and-proud-of-it-part-ii-a-christian-childhood/"&gt;“Christian Childhood.”&lt;/a&gt; And, unfortunately, there will be more parts.  &lt;em&gt;BioLogos&lt;/em&gt; loves this kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of going downhill, the Center for Inquiry, whose &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/"&gt;stated mission&lt;/a&gt; is “to foster a secular society based on science, reason, freedom of  inquiry, and humanist values,” seems to have one foot on Templeton Avenue.  Its latest production is &lt;a href="http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/the_problems_with_the_atheistic_approach_to_the_world/"&gt;a particularly poorly written and edited piece&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., “the  &lt;strong&gt; thir &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; d argument &lt;/strong&gt; against the march of organized atheism is it’s tendency toward an angry, uncompassionate line  of attack”), called “The problems with the atheistic view of the world,” by Michael De Dora, Jr.  De Dora, executive director of the New York CfI, is described as a “public voice for science, reason, and secular values,” as well as an erstwhile newswriter and editor at FOXNews.com and CUNY.  You couldn’t document either of these qualifications from this essay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Dora is apparently an atheist, but his post is a masterpiece of extended concern trolling. Here are his “arguments,” if you can call them that (see an earlier dissection on &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notes.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Butterflies and Wheels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. This is the  &lt;strong&gt; first argument &lt;/strong&gt; against atheism. It is not a philosophy or a worldview, it is a lack of  a specific religious belief, and that isn’t enough to carry us forward  in any meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that a problem?  And, really, isn’t it “carrying us forward” to sweep away false beliefs that hold us back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. This brings us to the  &lt;strong&gt; second argumen &lt;/strong&gt; t: [sic] atheists tend to view religion as either the problem, or the cause  of the problem, even when other problems are apparent. But while theism  is  &lt;em&gt; a &lt;/em&gt; problem, it is not  &lt;em&gt; the &lt;/em&gt; problem, and while atheism might be correct, atheism is not  &lt;em&gt; the &lt;/em&gt; answer. As the philosopher Massimo Pigliucci has noted, the larger  predicament we face is uncritical adherence to ideology — a problem  that spans more than just religion (5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True.  Nonetheless, religion is the biggest and most pervasive (and dangerous) source of “uncritical adherence to ideology.”  And not all atheists devote all of their time to attacking faith.  Many of us also deal with other types of unreason: homeopathy, climate-change denial, and the like.  Would De Dora just have us go after “irrational ideologies” in general &lt;em&gt;without mentioning religion&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The  &lt;strong&gt; thir &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; d argument &lt;/strong&gt;[sic] aginst the march of organized atheism is it’s [sic] tendency toward an angry, uncompassionate line  of attack. . . However, there is something to hearing these men [Dawkins and Hitchens] speak, and reading certain of their writing, that sends the message they have a short temper for religious belief (and the occasional believer). This attitude has trickled down, as well: for their followers, too often pride has led to arrogance — and not arrogance about the specific position on religion, but general intellectual arrogance at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the old arrogance argument again.  It’s not what we say, but our &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt;.  We’re arrogant and uncompromising.  When you can’t address the argument, attack the tone. Sheesh!  If anyone is arrogant, it’s the believers who are &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt;, in the face of all evidence, that a loving and beneficent God’s in his heaven, Jesus is his messenger, and if we’re good, one day we’ll disport ourselves with Ceiling Cat.  I wonder what De Dora would say about the advocates of civil rights in the ’60s.  Did they have a “short temper” for segregation?  Do advocates of gay rights have a “short temper” for homophobia? I remember, again back in the 60s, when people told freedom riders and other “uncivil” activists that they were hurting their cause by their in-your-face tactics.  That was garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s Dan Dennett’s take on “incivility” in &lt;a href="http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1001"&gt;an interview with Julian Baggini &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The Philosopher’s Magazine&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I listen to all these complaints about rudeness and intemperateness,  and the opinion that I come to is that there is no polite way of asking  somebody: have you considered the possibility that your entire life has  been devoted to a delusion? But that’s a good question to ask. Of course  we should ask that question and of course it’s going to offend people.  Tough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to De Dora:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. This brings us to the  &lt;strong&gt; fourth argument: &lt;/strong&gt; this view of the world divides people rather than bringing them  together. This is a symptom of the atheist tendency to see the world  through religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t De Dora recognize that advocating &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; cause that isn’t universally popular will divide people?  How about civil rights, or gender equality?  How about opposing the Catholic Church’s attitude toward AIDS, condoms, and homosexuality? Oh dear—so divisive!  Does De Dora, like his colleague Mooney, thinks we should shut up in the interest of universal harmony?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.  The  &lt;strong&gt; fifth argument &lt;/strong&gt; against using “atheist” is that atheists already face is that people  have the tendency to see the atheist approach as “against” and not  “for.” Of course, one cannot debunk or be against anything without  really being for something. We are seemingly only able to critique if we  have something to weigh the critiqued belief against. When Hitchens  rips apart a religious idea, he is surely tearing something down — but  he is doing so because he values evidence, reason, critical thinking,  science, democracy, and more. The term atheism doesn’t tell others the  reasons for critique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is weird. De Dora starts out by saying that his article is about “arguments against atheism,” but here he seems to be attacking only the term “atheism.” Personally, I don’t think that when we criticize it’s incumbent on us to suggest a replacement.  Isn’t it enough to decry the systematic cover-up of child abuse by the Catholic Church without having to outline what kind of church it should become?  When we go after astrology, do we have to suggest other ways for people to read their future? Steve Gould once published an essay (which I can’t locate) arguing that it’s worthwhile &lt;em&gt;in itself &lt;/em&gt;to get rid of nonsense. He’s absolutely right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And besides, many atheists &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; concerned with positive accomplishments.  Most of us recognize that faith fulfills certain needs that might be met in other ways. In &lt;em&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/em&gt;, Sam Harris talked about non-God-based replacements for spiritual needs, like meditation.  In his 2009 book &lt;em&gt;Living with Darwin&lt;/em&gt;, Philip Kitcher outlined ways that secular communities might be organized to meet the need for  “community” that religion currently satisfies.  But until this happens, and despite the clueless gobshitery of people like De Dora, we’ll keep fighting the grip of religious irrationality on our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has happened to the Center for Inquiry?  First M&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;oney, now this?  Has the CfI made a conscious decision that the best way to “foster a secular society” and promote “reason, freedom of inquiry, and humanist values” is to criticize atheists and cuddle up to the faithful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks and writings of Dawkins, Dennett, Harris and Hitchens are the best thing that’s happened to atheism in decades.  These guys have publicly raised the question, “Have you considered the possibility that your entire life has been devoted to a delusion?”  And people have listened, as witnessed by the millions of books sold and thousands of people turning out for debates and lectures. And yes, some people have even c&lt;em&gt;hanged their minds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jessop was convicted Wednesday on allegations that he illegally married and fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl while living at the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Schleicher County in 2006.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was sentenced to 75 years in prison and has to pay a $10,000 fine for sexual assault of a child.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in addition to impregnating an underage girl, he also lied about it — saying she was 18 when she wasn’t — and really doesn’t seem to think he did anything wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion gave him a cover for his criminal actions, but the jury didn’t let him get away with it.  They need to be applauded for that.&lt;/p&gt;

That paper's abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The organization of taking turns to talk is fundamental to conversation, as well as to other speech-exchange systems. A model for the turn-taking organization for conversation is proposed, and is examined for its compatibility with a list of grossly observable facts about conversation. The results of the examination suggest that, at least, a model for turn-taking in conversation will be characterized as locally-managed, party-administered, interactionally controlled, and sensitive to recipient design. Several general consequences of the model are explicated, and contrasts are sketched with turn-taking organizations for other speech-exchange systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the recent IEEE ICASSP meeting in Dallas, one of the papers that caught my eye was Chi-Chun Lee and Shrikanth Narayanan, "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CLeeICASSP2010.pdf"&gt;Predicting interruptions in dyadic interactions&lt;/a&gt;", ICASSP 2010. Their paper starts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;During dyadic spontaneous human conversation, interruptions occur frequently and often correspond to breaks in the information flow between conversation partners. Accurately predicting such dialog events not only provides insights into the modeling of human interactions and conversational turntaking behaviors but can also be used as an essential module in the design of natural human-machine interface. Further, we can capture information such as the likely interruption conditions and interrupter’s signallings by incorporating both conversation agents in the prediction model (we define in this paper the interrupter as the person who takes over the speaking turn and the interruptee as the person who yields the turn). This modeling is predicated on the knowledge that conversation flow is the result of the interplay between interlocutor behaviors. The proposed prediction incorporates cues from both speakers to obtain improved prediction accuracy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work comes out of &lt;a href="http://sail.usc.edu/shri.php"&gt;Shrikanth Narayanan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://sail.usc.edu/index.php"&gt;SAIL&lt;/a&gt; ("Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory") at USC, where a &lt;a href="http://sail.usc.edu/aigaion2/index.php/publications"&gt;lot of interesting work&lt;/a&gt; is done. But before going on to tell you a little more about this work on interruption-prediction, I want to note the curious lack of communication between the disciplinary configurations represented by these two quoted passages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the two passages, an outsider might think that the researchers responsible for them were working on the same range of problems, and even in the same general disciplinary tradition, modulo the changes to be expected over a timespan of 35 years. But in fact, they come from two radically different traditions, which may or may not be mutually intelligible, but in any case are almost entirely without any direct communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/schegloff/"&gt;Manny Schegloff&lt;/a&gt; is still an active researcher, in the sociology department at UCLA, roughly ten miles away from USC. I suppose that Schegloff and Narayanan must know of one another's existence. However, in documents on SAIL's website, Schegloff is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsail.usc.edu%2F+Schegloff&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;never cited or mentioned&lt;/a&gt;. (This is not an indexing problem, since e.g. Liz Shriberg is cited &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsail.usc.edu%2F+Shriberg&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;gs_rfai="&gt;49 times&lt;/a&gt;, as well she should be. ) And the lack of communication is apparently mutual — Narayanan is apparently &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=BPr&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;channel=s&amp;amp;as_q=Narayanan&amp;amp;as_epq=&amp;amp;as_oq=&amp;amp;as_eq=&amp;amp;num=10&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_filetype=&amp;amp;ft=i&amp;amp;as_sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sscnet.ucla.edu%2Fsoc%2Ffaculty%2Fschegloff%2Fpubs%2F&amp;amp;as_qdr=all&amp;amp;as_rights=&amp;amp;as_occt=any&amp;amp;cr=&amp;amp;as_nlo=&amp;amp;as_nhi=&amp;amp;safe=off"&gt;not mentioned in any of Schegloff's publications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't normally comment on this sort of thing, but I couldn't quite resist the irony of two researchers working on communicative interaction, at institutions less than ten miles apart, without any communicative interaction. Still, I should make it clear that this is not a matter of personal relationships, as far as I know, but rather the typical circumstance of disciplinary isolation. The world of speech and language research could be described as a sort of intellectual Balkans, except that the norm is not so much mutual hatred as mutual ignorance. There are at least half a dozen major cultures, and dozens more minor ones, all living and working more or less as if they were separated by impassable mountains and unfordable rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, back to Lee and Narayanan's interesting work on interruption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We used the &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/gg5715k54l151272/"&gt;IEMOCAP&lt;/a&gt; database for the present study. It was collected for the purpose of studying different modalities in expressive spoken dialog interaction. The database was recorded in five dyadic sessions, and each session consists of a different pair of male and female actors both acting out scripted plays and engaging in spontaneous dialogs in hypothetical real-life scenarios. In this paper, we are interested in the spontaneous portions of the database since they closely resemble real-life conversation. During each spontaneous dialog, 61 markers (two on the head, 53 on the face, and three on each hand) were attached to one of the interlocutors to record (x, y, z) positions of each marker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what the marker positions were like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LeeFig1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The basis of the study was a comparison of 130 interruptions and 252 "smooth transitions": In total, we annotated 1763 turn transitions in which 1558 were smooth transitions and 215 were interruptions. Since the distribution of these two types of turn transitions is highly unequal, we downsampled the data by including only three sessions (six subjects) of the IEMOCAP database with three dialogs chosen for each recording session. Subjects and dialogs were selected to include a majority of the annotated interruptions. In total, there are 382 turn transitions annotated with 130 interruptions and 252 smooth transitions used as our dataset in this paper. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in classifying transitions as "interruption" or "smooth", the baseline performance is what you get by always guessing "smooth", namely 252/382 = 66%. Using  the face and body-gesture features of the interrupte, and various acoustic features of the interruptee, both taken during a one-second period prior to the transition, Lee and Narayanan were able to do a bit better than this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LeeTable1.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LeeTable1.png" alt="" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logistic regression got them to 68%, and a "hidden conditional random field" model, with some special attention to feature selection, got them nearly to 71%. (The "Precision" and "Recall" values mean that in their best-performing model, 57% of the transitions predicted to be interruptions actually were interruptions, while 51% of the interruptions were predicted to be such. And they used a cross-validation approach, so that the numbers are not inflated by testing on the training set.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking fact about this result, it seems to me, is that interruptions turn out to be so hard to predict, at least in this particular collection of interactions. I wouldn't have predicted that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also tried predictions based only on one side or the other of the interaction. Here again, the results are a bit surprising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LeeTable2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, when they try to predict interruptions solely from the interrupter's face and body kinematics, they do a bit worse than chance. Predicting solely on the basis of the interruptee's audio features, they do somewhat better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new research suggests the ability to regenerate isn’t based on  something newts and flatworms have that we don’t; rather, it’s something  we do have that’s keeping us from regenerating tissues.

On Tuesday, skeptics in the UK will test the power of this lobby by organizing at the House of Commons to demand libel reform. Of course this is an issue that is not only serious for residents of the UK but everyone who criticizes advocates of bad ideas on the internet because from what some have told me, they too are potential targets of libel suits.&lt;/p&gt;

He left a voicemail with the superintendent and contacted the ACLU. . .and it worked. The school is no longer performing the prayers. A job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

Taitz, who refuses to budge on her irrational belief that Obama is not a natural born citizen despite undeniable evidence to the contrary, continues to fight the $20,000 fine issued on her for  making frivolous filings. And now she runs the risk of actually being disbarred. We can hope right. Of course it’s pretty silly that she even gets to call herself a lawyer given her pathetic credentials. Of course her lawyer is pushing the conspiracy angle and calling this a “witch hunt” but really, if she was an actual threat to the evil president’s position and they’d gone this far to cover up his origins, don’t you think they’d find a far more efficient way of getting Taitz out of the way. And you just know that whatever the outcome, she’ll just insist that the Bar Association is in on the evil conspiracy. So since she’ll attack them no matter what they might as well throw the book at her and make sure she’s never allowed to practice law again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Boy Scouts of  America has long kept an extensive archive of secret documents  that chronicle the sexual abuse of young boys by Scout leaders over the  years.The “perversion files,” a nickname the Boy Scouts are said to  have used for the documents, have rarely been seen by the public, but  that could all change in the coming weeks in an Oregon courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer for a man who was molested in the 1980s by  a Scout leader  has obtained about 1,000 Boy Scouts sex files and is expected to  release some of them at a trial that began Wednesday. The lawyer says  the files show how the Boy Scouts have covered up abuse for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well what do you expect from a cult who once had a leader named “Brigham Young”? Still the BSA are lightweights compared to the Catholic Church, which is known for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5JmpfG0RvY&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;having raped at least over a half million kids&lt;/a&gt;. And keep in mind that that’s only that we know of and the Church has proven capable of keeping this stuff secret for decades.&lt;/p&gt;

In the &lt;a href="http://www.courant.com/news/education/hc-evolution-haddam-school-boar.artmar15,0,4249837.story" rel="external "&gt;Hartford Courant newspaper article&lt;/a&gt; on Harris is quoted as saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I sort of got stuck on one thing with [the science teachers], which was basically the teaching of evolution in the schools and how it tends to ride roughshod over the fact that various religions – Christian, Hebrew, Muslim – hold a theistic world view,” Harris said one morning during a break from his job driving a school van. “Evolution is basically an assumption that there is no God.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right.  Just what Connecticut needs: A school bus driver leaning on science teachers about evolution in aid of the Abrahamic religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a school administrator weighed in with the usual spinelessness of such apparatchiks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles J. Macunas, principal of Haddam-Killingworth High School, attended the meeting and characterized it as “very pleasant, not the least bit adversarial.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a new board member, he was just trying to get a handle on content that’s taught in an area he’s very passionate about,” Macunas said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like the brave superintendent of the Dover Area School District.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disco ‘Tute spokesweasel Casy Luskin weighed in, too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People should weigh the evidence and draw their own conclusions,” said Casey Luskin, a policy analyst with the institute. “We’re talking about one of the most foundational questions of humanity: Where did we come from? There are credible scientists that challenge Darwinism. It is unconscionable to censor those views from students in the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the Disco ‘Tute is described as “…a think tank in Seattle that funds research into alternative theories of human origin,…”.  Sure it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Disco Dancers had better get a leash on Harris, though.  He is quoted as saying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not going to be fighting for the overthrow of any one way of doing things because we’ve gone past that,” he said. “It’s time for balance. … And I just want to be there so there’s a voice that says there’s room for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Balance”?  Someone should refer Harris to &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwards-v-aguillard.html" rel="external "&gt;Edwards v. Aguillard&lt;/a&gt; for some legal background on that “balanced treatment” idea.  Between his listing of the Abrahamic religions as part of his talk with science teachers and his “balance” comments, he’s already blown the gaff.  Lenny Flank’s rule still holds.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s also true that the LHC has &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; conducted  proton-proton collisions at greater than TeV levels (up to about 2.36  TeV, it seems)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#Current_results"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#Current_results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite this fact, we’re all still here.  Of course, I expect the   scare mongers to come back with something like “But we don’t know that   the planet won’t be destroyed at the next energy level!”  By that same   token, we don’t know that the Earth won’t be destroyed if we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; turn the damn thing on, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arguments from ignorance can be used in such silly ways.  ‘Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—————————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt; (LHC) is the largest, most complicated piece of machinery ever created by humanity.  This humongous particle accelerator also just recently broke, once again, the world record for achieving the highest-energy artificial particle collisions ever in history.  Of course, there are some &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Conspiracy_Theory"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;-minded scare mongers out there who maintain that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_particle_collisions_at_the_Large_Hadron_Collider"&gt;the LHC is going to somehow destroy the Earth&lt;/a&gt;, presumably because – &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/three-reasons-why-the-large-hadron-collider-will-not-destroy-the-earth/"&gt;despite multiple reasons to the contrary&lt;/a&gt; – there will be some unknown, magical mechanism by which these artificially-achieved energy levels will kill us all.  In short, with no evidence or coherent theory of physics behind their claims, they’re making an &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Argument_from_Ignorance"&gt;argument from ignorance&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; saying this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/demo-hadron_collider.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="demo-hadron_collider" src="http://skepticalteacher.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/demo-hadron_collider.jpg?w=508&amp;amp;h=407" alt="" width="508" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think not – it didn’t happen in May 2008, and it won’t happen now.  As I said, the LHC recently broke that supposedly world-ending energy barrier once again, and we’re all still here.  The news is outlined in &lt;a href="http://m.yahoo.com/w/ynews/article/science/0?url=http%3A%2F%2Fxml.news.yahoo.com%2Fus%2Fnews%2Frss%2Frichstoryrss.html%3Fu%3D%2Fap%2F20100319%2Fap_on_sc%2Feu_big_bang_machine&amp;amp;.ts=1269033203&amp;amp;.intl=US&amp;amp;.lang=en"&gt;this Yahoo News story…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operators of the world’s largest atom  smasher on Friday ramped up their massive machine to three times the  energy ever previously achieved, in the run-up to experiments probing  the secrets of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The European  Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, said beams of protons  circulated at 3.5 trillion electron volts in both directions around the  27-kilometer (17-mile) tunnel housing the Large Hadron Collider under  the Swiss-French border at Geneva.
&lt;p&gt;The next major development is  expected in a few days when CERN starts colliding the beams in a new  round of research to examine the tiniest particles and forces within the  atom in hopes of finding out more about how matter is made up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  collider in December had already eclipsed the record of the next most  powerful machine, the Tevatron at Fermilab outside Chicago, which has  been running just shy of a trillion electron volts, or TeV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  extra energy in Geneva is expected to reveal even more about the  unanswered questions of particle physics , such as the existence of dark  energy and matter. Scientists hope also to approach on a tiny scale  what happened in the first split seconds after the Big Bang, which they  theorize was the creation of the universe some 14 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CERN  has reported a series of successes since the collider was restarted  last year after 14 months of repairs and improvements following a  spectacular failure when scientists initially tried to get the machine  going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CERN improved the machine during a 2 1/2-month winter  shutdown to be able to operate at the higher energy .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting  the beams to 3.5 TeV is testimony to the soundness of the LHC’s overall  design, and the improvements we’ve made since the breakdown in September  2008,” said Steve Myers, CERN’s director for accelerators and  technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be interesting to see how the scare mongering &lt;a href="http://skepticwiki.org/index.php/Pseudoscience"&gt;pseudoscientists&lt;/a&gt; rationalize away this one, but I’m sure they’ll find some way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like its anti-creationist partner, the Skeptical Science app is well laid-out and indexed, making it a handy reference for those on-the-spot conversations that demand an immediate correction or rebuttal.  In addition, it’s free &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the front page of the website states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific skepticism is healthy. Scientists should always challenge  themselves to expand their knowledge and improve their understanding.  Yet this isn’t what happens in global warming skepticism. Skeptics  vigorously criticise any evidence that supports man-made global warming  and yet eagerly, even blindly embrace any argument, op-ed piece, blog or  study that refutes global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this website gets skeptical about global warming skepticism. Do  their arguments have any scientific basis? What does the peer reviewed  scientific literature say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I expected a lot of push-back on my critical views of mirror neurons, and I wasn&amp;#39;t disappointed. One of my major points of emphasis is and has been that if the mirror neuron system is really important for action understanding, then damage to action execution should result in action understanding deficits. I have pointed out that this prediction doesn&amp;#39;t hold, either in apraxia or with more force in aphasia.  A typical response to this argument is that &amp;quot;the mirror system&amp;quot; involves lots of areas working together (George Lakoff, who was at the UCSD lecture even seemed willing to include the STS in this network) and so it is no surprise that damage to fronto-parietal areas doesn&amp;#39;t result in the expected action understanding deficits. Along these lines, some folks pointed out that mirror responses have now been found in lots of brain areas, not just the frontal and parietal areas where they have been documented in monkeys.  In other words, the mirror system is expanding.  At this point in the talk, Pat Churchland, who was my host, jumped in and said (and I paraphrase here), &amp;quot;Now wait a minute. If mirror neurons are all over the brain then don&amp;#39;t they lose their explanatory power? Aren&amp;#39;t we now just back to our old friend, the How Does the Brain Work Problem?&amp;quot;  Very true, I think.I ran into this same issue in my debate with Fadiga at the Neurobiology of Language Conference in Chicago.  I said, here are several examples of preserved speech perception in the face of an absence of speech production ability, and the mirror neuron proponents said basically, it&amp;#39;s a large system that&amp;#39;s too complicated to succumb to the loss of the motor system.A new review by Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia (2010) also pushes back against some of the critiques that have been raised lately. One concerns the observation that mirror responses in a TMS paradigm can be re-trained such that they no longer mirror and dissociated from understanding. RS: &amp;quot;The reason is that, in the task, there was nothing to understand: the investigated movements were meaningless.&amp;quot; Another is the &amp;quot;surprising&amp;quot; claim (mine) that damage to the fronto-parietal motor system should be associated with deficits in action understanding. RS:&amp;quot; As clearly shown by electrophysiological mapping, there are motor sectors in the monkey inferior parietal lobule (and even in area PFG) with and without mirror neurons. Thus, dissociations between motor deficits and action understanding deficits can and do occur.&amp;quot; Wait, I thought the mirror system got is magical powers from being part of the motor system. If the motor system is functionally disrupted, shouldn&amp;#39;t the action understanding system also be disrupted? Or is there a parallel mirror motor system that can&amp;#39;t control movement but can understand action (kind of sounds like a sensory system to me).  I think the mirror neuron folks have a serious problem on their hands: there is apparently no empirical result that can falsify the theory. If a mirror neuron shows up in an unexpected place, it is a new part of the mirror system. If a mirror neuron&amp;#39;s activity dissociates from action understanding, it was not coding understanding at that moment. If damage to the motor system doesn&amp;#39;t disrupt understanding, it is because that part of the motor system isn&amp;#39;t mirroring. Can someone from the mirror neuron camp come forward and provide us with an example of what kind of empirical result would falsify the theory?  Because if you can&amp;#39;t falsify it, it&amp;#39;s no longer a scientific theory, it&amp;#39;s religion. Rizzolatti G, &amp;amp; Sinigaglia C (2010).

Kwala, the dog Mark taught to &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000164.html"&gt;sing&lt;/a&gt;, the dog who &lt;a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/"&gt;ate exams&lt;/a&gt;, died this morning, aged fifteen.  In addition to Mark's musical collaboration with her, Kwala has a claim to Language Log mention for another reason: in her young and vigorous days, she accompanied me to my Intro to Language class when the topic was animal language (or animal "language").  I ordered, ROLL OVER!  And she rolled over.  I ordered, BOWL SNOVER!  And she rolled over.  I ordered, SNIG BLIVVER!  And she rolled over.  Finally a clever student pointed out that the intonation was the same on all three utterances, and she could've been going by that (since she obviously wasn't responding to the actual words in the utterance).  He may well have been right; or maybe it was just that she refused to learn any other tricks.  She was smart: she was the only dog I've ever had, for instance, who would consistently backtrack around a pole when she was on the leash and we found ourselves on opposite sides of the pole; but she always considered it beneath her dignity to do tricks, no matter how many treats she got for doing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that she's gone, we'll probably have to retire Rich's Kwala Lexicon, which enshrined her independent (read: disobedient) spirit.  But here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KWALITY: any bad trait or characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KWALIFY: to bite another dog.  As in: Rich: &amp;quot;I hope your walk in the park was an unkwalified success.&amp;quot; — Sally: &amp;quot;Not really; she acted as if she wanted to kwalify just about every dog in the damned park.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DISKWALIFY: to remove the dog hair from.  As in: "I had to diskwalify the guest-room bed again."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INEKWALITY: the condition of having to sleep on a dog bed.  As in: "Kwala snapped at me when I insisted on her inekwality."&lt;/p&gt;

This is my last day writing before my spring break begins, and I'm hoping for some great weather as I prepare to head to the Oregon coast.  Warm weather, clear skies... I can picture it now.  In my dreams, it looks something like this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/oregon-coast-sunset-79.3.jpg" width="500" alt="oregon-coast-sunset-79.3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes me think about global warming, the greenhouse effect, and whether this is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; cause for concern or not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, it's definitely true that heating the planet up by even a few degrees will have catastrophic effects on our sea levels as the ice sheets over Antarctica and Greenland melt, displacing hundreds of millions of people and causing worldwide changes in the production of our food supply.  For example, if the sea level rises by just 60 meters (that's a &lt;i&gt;partial&lt;/i&gt; melting of those ice sheets), all of the areas in red on the map will go from being (mostly habitable) land to being underwater.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/flod60c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/flod60c-thumb-500x250-43017.jpg" width="500" height="250" alt="flod60c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click to enlarge, of course, and note that huge sections of the U.S., India, China, England, and coastal Europe will be &lt;b&gt;underwater&lt;/b&gt;.  So that's one hand.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, could changes to the atmosphere really be the &lt;b&gt;cause&lt;/b&gt; of changes in temperature?  In all honesty, it's hard to answer that question just from looking at Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/695552819_8f3e14bdff.jpg" width="500" height="458" alt="695552819_8f3e14bdff.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we have some other, nearby worlds to help shed light on our situation.  Let's take a look at the planets of the inner Solar System: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/Terrestrial_planet_size_comparisons.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/Terrestrial_planet_size_comparisons-thumb-500x217-43020.jpg" width="500" height="217" alt="Terrestrial_planet_size_comparisons.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercury is the closest to the Sun, and gets awfully hot, topping out at about 450 Celsius (840 Fahrenheit) during the hottest part of the day &amp;amp; year.  And as you might expect, of the four rocky planets we have to look at, Mars is the coldest.  But if you look at the &lt;a href="http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q2681.html"&gt;hottest part of Mars&lt;/a&gt; during the hottest times, it can get all the way up to about 27 Celsius (81 Fahrenheit), which isn't too bad, considering how much farther away it is!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you'd expect, Earth is cooler than Mercury but warmer than Mars.  And I bet that you'd expect Venus -- being closer than Earth but farther away than Mercury -- would have temperatures in between Mercury's and Earth's.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/venus.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="venus.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well.  It turns out that Venus has an &lt;b&gt;average&lt;/b&gt; temperature of about 460 Celsius (860 Fahrenheit), with &lt;i&gt;no significant differences&lt;/i&gt; between day and night temperatures, even though a day on Venus lasts about 117 Earth days!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What gives?  Venus is about twice as far from the Sun as Mercury, and therefore receives only about &lt;i&gt;one-quarter&lt;/i&gt; of the energy from the Sun for each square mile of its surface as compared to Mercury.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/planet_orbits-inner.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/planet_orbits-inner-thumb-500x497-43024.gif" width="500" height="497" alt="planet_orbits-inner.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what gives?  Why is Venus so hot?  If you really want to know, all you have to do is look at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus"&gt;Venus' atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;.  Take a look at the swirling clouds in the atmosphere, and you'll immediately know something fishy is up.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/Venuspioneeruv.jpg" width="500" height="536" alt="Venuspioneeruv.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venus has an atmosphere that's something like 93 times as thick as Earth's, and over 96% of that atmosphere is &lt;b&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/b&gt;.  That thick atmosphere lets lots of Solar Radiation (visible and ultraviolet light) in.  When the planet tries to get rid of it -- just like Earth does -- it re-radiates that energy in the infrared.  But carbon dioxide doesn't let infrared light through very well, it &lt;b&gt;reflects&lt;/b&gt; it back onto the planet's surface.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how a greenhouse works, and that's why it's called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect"&gt;the greenhouse effect&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on/greenhouse_effect1.14494704_std.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="greenhouse_effect1.14494704_std.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a real effect, it really happens, and everyone agrees that &lt;b&gt;this is the cause for why Venus is as hot as it is&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If everyone can agree on this, then the question &lt;i&gt;isn't&lt;/i&gt; whether putting carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is going to cause a greenhouse effect: &lt;b&gt;it does&lt;/b&gt;.  (And people contending otherwise, &lt;a href="http://www.nov55.com/gbwm.html"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;, are wrong, and now you know why.)  The real question -- the only one up for debate -- is this: &lt;b&gt;how much&lt;/b&gt; of an effect will adding carbon dioxide to our atmosphere cause?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientifically, it is no longer a question of &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; global warming happens when you increase carbon dioxide in your atmosphere: &lt;b&gt;it does&lt;/b&gt;.  It's now a question of how much carbon dioxide will lead to an unacceptable level of warming for Earth, and what -- as the only species on the planet capable of doing something about it -- we're &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; going to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/one_thing_we_can_all_agree_on.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269043597306"><id gr:original-id="http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/03/calorie-restriction-reduces-lipofuscin-buildup-is-good-for-nerves.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75a00fef9e437676</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Calorie Restriction Reduces Lipofuscin Buildup, is Good for Nerves</title><published>2010-03-19T19:08:51Z</published><updated>2010-03-19T19:08:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/JOa2ahtf94A/calorie-restriction-reduces-lipofuscin-buildup-is-good-for-nerves.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/03/calorie-restriction-reduces-lipofuscin-buildup-is-good-for-nerves.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">The long-term practice of calorie restriction has been demonstrated to slow almost every aspect of age-related change and degeneration in those mammals most exhaustively tested (i.e. mice and rats). So far the primate and human studies are producing the same sorts of result, but it will be another decade or more before the present research community has covered all the bases in humans. Still, the evidence to date is very compelling: regular exercise and calorie restriction kept up over the years have a far more powerful positive effect on general health and longevity than any medical technology presently available. I noticed a paper today that demonstrates another benefit of calorie restriction in rats: it reduces lipofuscin buildup and the consequent damage to lysosomes, the cell's recycling units. This buildup of unwanted biochemicals that the body cannot break down is one of the fundamental contributions to age-related degeneration of the body, and less of it is better for you.

&lt;p&gt;Todd has given organization-changing gifts to the &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://secular.org"&gt;Secular Coalition for America&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://atheists.org"&gt;American Atheists&lt;/a&gt; in the past year.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Last week, he donated $20,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi so it could sponsor a high school prom after the Itawamba County School District canceled the dance rather than allow a lesbian to bring her girlfriend as a date.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonat Shimron&lt;/strong&gt;’s article explains why Todd has made atheist activism his passion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stiefel wants to create a culture in the United States in which secularists — be they atheists, agnostics or humanists — are respected…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… Stiefel has made it his mission to raise the profile of atheists and lower the volume of hostility directed at them. He acknowledges that some atheists have been outspoken, perhaps even intemperate, and he says he’d like to lend them a softer, more diplomatic image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… more than anything, Stiefel is interested in dispelling the notion that atheists don’t believe in anything and are therefore capable of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re equally capable of being ethical as people who are religious,” he said. “We just want to be good for goodness’ sake.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to top it off, he’s just a really nice guy.  He’s a donor, yes, but he’s also one of the most active volunteers I’ve ever met.  People like him don’t come around very often, so we’re fortunate he’s on our side.&lt;/p&gt;

It is always interesting to watch the reactions of visitors to this curious fact. Adult men, for instance, sometimes seem unsettled by the thought of male pregnancy, but the reproductive reversal among the fish is often seen as kinda cute ("How sweet. A fishy dad taking care of his kids!"). As shown by a study by Kimberly Paczolt and Adam Jones published this week in Nature, however, there can be a dark side to male pregnancy.

Amnesty International is calling on Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah to stop the execution of a Lebanese man sentenced to death for "sorcery."

&lt;p&gt;In a statement released Thursday, the international rights group condemned the verdict and demanded the immediate release of Ali Hussain Sibat, former host of a popular call-in show that aired on Sheherazade, a Beirut based satellite TV channel.&lt;br&gt;

Mr. Zane, what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic  things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent  response were you even close to anything that could be considered a  rational thought. Everyone watching this video is now dumber for having  listened to it. I award you no points, and may the Flying Spaghetti Monster have mercy on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t heard incoherent rambling like that since Miss North Carolina:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;   &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/lj3iNxZ8Dww%26rel%3D1%26fs%3D1%26showsearch%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean good Zeus.

And are there even lead characters in film and television who aren’t going through transitions in their lives? That’s sort of the definition of drama and narrative, Billy. But bravo on that vacuous answer to the god question. There’s a whole lot of brain dead morons out there who eat that stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also makes a great example of what’s the harm in nonsense. Billy Zane helps only one charity and it’s going towards total garbage that helps no one. Good job, Billy.&lt;/p&gt;

He became the world's first professor of complementary medicine. He wrote (with Simon Singh) the excellent book &lt;em&gt;Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine&lt;/em&gt; as well as other books and innumerable articles for the media and for scientific journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years Ernst has led one of the world's leading centers for alternative medicine research, The Centre for Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter in the UK. Among other things, this center has done many rigorous systematic reviews of the literature. These reviews have acknowledged that there is good evidence for a few things (like St. John's wort for mild to moderate depression,) but they have found no evidence to support the majority of alternative medical treatments. Where the evidence is lacking, they are not afraid to conclude that these things don't work; whereas the NCCAM (National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) in the US has been unwilling to discredit any treatment and instead consistently calls for "more studies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/medicine/article7047382.ece"&gt;A recent article in &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that Ernst's research center will close next year unless a new financial backer can be found. Ernst believes that he has become a persona non grata since he attacked a report that was commissioned by HRH Prince Charles. In an e-mail comment on the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article he clarified "the complaint letter was not on the foundation's but HRH's letterhead and that my VC does not even respond to my letter raising the issue of the missing £1.5 million."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope that other funding sources will be found to continue this valuable work. If his university doesn't come through, perhaps the skeptical community can find a way to help.&lt;/p&gt;

Christianity is growing in the southern hemisphere and Asia, while Islam is growing in Europe. What alarms me is that in maybe in 50-100 years Europe will be dominated by Muslims while the southern parts of the world will be dominated by Christians. If so there could be wars. America is following in the footsteps of Europe by becoming more secular. If America steps in between them she will have to deal with the might of Europe aimed at the Christian tribes in the south. Then all hell will break loose with another World War. And in this war these countries will have more advanced weapons of warfare. It could happen.

But rather than just supposing that this is the result of football&amp;#39;s cultural status and importance, researchers have also suggested that it is the result of natural selection - not the survival of the fittest, as modern medicine and cultural systems ensure that in the Western world at least, most people have the chance to live, but perhaps the success of the fittest.The argument runs like this. In prehistoric times, humans were subject to both natural and sexual selection. Sexual selection works in two ways. Firstly, there is mate choice (intersexual selection), which may be expressed by one or both sexes - i.e. either men or women or both may select their mates according to certain criteria of judgement. Secondly, within a sex (usually males) there may be competition for resources, particularly those which enable access to mates or successful child-rearing. This second form of selection, called intrasexual selection, is what produces fighting between the males of many species. Many Western societies now frown upon direct competition in terms of fighting, but the characteristics which make for good fighters likely remain - and may be expressed as prowess in sports which require high levels of spatial judgement, speed, endurance and strength. Football may be one such sport.If this was the case, we might expect to see correlations between the levels of the male hormone testosterone, often associated with strength and other typically male characteristics, and football ability. Testosterone has also been linked to the formation of an efficient cardiovascular system in men, making it potentially even more important for fighting and/or football playing, although its action upon these systems occurs before birth (pre-natally), and therefore cannot easily be measured for large samples of football players. To test for a link between football (or sporting) abilities and testosterone levels, then, researchers have to be a little more creative. The paper I have recently read on the subject, published in 2001 by Manning and Taylor, for instance, looks for correlation between sporting abilities in football players of various standards and the ratio of the second digit (the index finger) and the fourth digit (the ring finger). This ratio, written as 2D:4D, is typically lower in men than in women. That is, men tend to have shorter index fingers relative to the length of the ring finger while women have the opposite. This ratio has been explicitly linked to testosterone levels during foetal development, and does not change after a child is born (barring accidents involving the fingers), making it a good proxy for prenatal testosterone levels (Manning and Taylor 2001).Manning and Taylor, therefore, carried out three studies looking for a link between the 2D:4D ratio, sporting ability (particularly in football) and visual-spatial judgement, thought to be an indicator of high &amp;quot;fitness&amp;quot; in men. The first two of these studies used participants from sports centres and libraries, and asked them to rank their sporting abilities on a scale from 10 (&amp;quot;I have represented my country&amp;quot;) down to 0 (&amp;quot;I do no sport&amp;quot;). The first of these studies found a link between 2D:4D ratios and sporting scores such that the higher the score a participant gave the lower the digit ratio was, and hence the higher their pre-natal testosterone exposure likely was. The second found a similar link between visual-spatial judgement scores and 2D:4D ratios. Both these relationships were quite variable (with participants at a particular sporting level having varying digit ratios), but were statistically significant, that is, highly unlikely to have arisen due to chance alone.The third study, meanwhile, examined footballers specifically and ranked them according to their league and coach references. It also involved a &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; group of non-footballers, for comparative purposes. It found that there was not only a difference in 2D:4D ratio between footballers and controls (footballers had lower average digit ratios), there was also a decrease in digit ratio the higher up the sporting scale the footballer was. So international players had lower 2D:4D ratios than players in the premier league, who had lower ratios than first division club players, and so on. Coaches, interestingly, fell between internationals and premier club players, suggesting (as is indeed the case) that they would have been highly successful footballers themselves (Manning and Taylor 2001).So, all this suggests that footballers, and sporting professionals in general, are successful because they are some of &amp;quot;the fittest&amp;quot; in an evolutionary sense; they have high pre-natal testosterone levels, and hence well developed &amp;quot;fighting&amp;quot; skills which can be transferred into sports. Manning and Taylor also note that there are two possible explanations of this high fitness. Firstly, as study two suggested, there may be a link between visual-spatial awareness and pre-natal testosterone levels. Alternatively, or as well, the role of testosterone in the development of the cardiovascular system may be important. Both hypotheses are supported by some evidence (for example, that exposure of male foetuses to female hormones in the womb can lead to both digit anomalies and malfunctions of the cardio-vascular system), but we cannot yet discriminate between them. Still, if the great social institution and economic phenomenon that is international football could have arisen as the result of selection for male fighting abilities, we may be looking too hard for direct evolutionary explanations of other modern human traits like culture and language. Perhaps they, too, as some researchers suggest, were in part the by-products of selection for other features.ReferencesManning JT, &amp;amp; Taylor RP (2001).

&lt;p&gt;And what do they learn? Surprisingly little, it seems. The ignorance drips from every quote &lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/2010/03/creationists-museum-facts-evolution/"&gt;of this article&lt;/a&gt;, so let’s analyze it, in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They plan to become doctors, researchers and professors, but these students from Liberty University, an evangelical school, also believe God created the Earth in a week, some 6,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, a group of biology students at the Christian university based in Lynchburg, Virginia, travels to the Natural History Museum in Washington to learn about a theory they dismiss as incorrect — Darwin’s theory of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bit is fascinating, they go every year, yet every year, they seem to fail to grasp it. I wonder why…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young “creationists” examined a model of the Morganucodon rat, believed to be the first and common ancestor of mammals that appeared some 210 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no “first” mammal; it also is probably like the common ancestor, but most likely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the actually common ancestor, although it may be similar. All “true” mammals (eutherians) share a common ancestor much more recently than Morganucodons, but I digress. There are no “firsts” of any group. It may be similar to a common ancestor, but if you’re going by when &lt;em&gt;mammary glands &lt;/em&gt;(from which mammals get their name) first developed, you’ll likely have to go back to the therapsids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Dunn, 19, a second-year biology student, was unimpressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprising, cognitive dissonance usually does that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“210 million years, that’s arbitrary. They put that time to make up for what they don’t know,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, so radiometric dating, temporal use of the specific stratum to which these organisms are found, and molecular genetic techniques do not constitute evidence? Fascinating, truly fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathan Hubbard, a 20-year-old from Michigan and a first-year biology major who plans to become a doctor, regarded the model with suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the only shocking part about this is that this individual &lt;em&gt;plans&lt;/em&gt; to become a doctor; I suppose evolution of bacterial and viral strains don’t count as evolution….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no scientific, biological genetic way that this, this rat, could become you,” he said, seemingly scandalized by the proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not, it’s dead! It also, more than likely, is similar to the ancestral organisms (read: &lt;em&gt;of ancestral type&lt;/em&gt;) but not an ancestor. That organism of course did not “become” anything other than, perhaps, an ancestor and a fossil. Moreover, every single organism from our common ancestor to modern humans would have looked so similar to one another as to be considered “the same” as its parents and offspring. We are talking about being &lt;em&gt;millions&lt;/em&gt; of generations separated from this organism. The changes from one generation to the next never deviated from the range of morphologies of the ancestral generation. In other words, the diversity within a population was always within the diversity of the previous generation. New traits may have arisen, but these new traits would not diverge far from the previous generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty University is the most prominent evangelical university in the United States, with some 12,000 students who adhere to strict rules and regulations regarding moral conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “evangelical university” seems like an oxymoron to me…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its biology curriculum includes a course on “Young Earth Creationism”, which juxtaposes Charles Darwin’s “Origin of the Species” with the Book of Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if they read this, complete with &lt;em&gt;both &lt;/em&gt;creation myths which are mutually exclusive; which one do they use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to be the best creationist, you have to be the best evolutionist you can be,” said Marcus Ross, who teaches paleontology and says of Adam and Eve: “I feel they were real people, they were the first people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, you must understand the straw man to which you oppose. Similarly, there were no “first” people (see above), there were ancestral individuals which could be described as &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, but there is no “first” human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;David DeWitt, a Liberty University biology professor, opens his classes with a prayer, asking God to help him teach his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a neat idea, but I don’t think it’s working; pray less, study more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I pray that you help me to teach effectively and help the students to learn and defend their faith,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, defending one’s faith is more important than understanding the world around them, that’s so cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strongly-expressed faith is not unusual in the United States, a country where 80 percent of the population claim to believe in God and ascribe to established religions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, sad fact, but appeals to the majority don’t constitute evidence…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polls taken in the last two years found that between 44 and 46 percent of Americans believe that the Earth was created in a week, somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationism, an increasingly popular theory in the United States and elsewhere in the world, rejects Darwin’s theory that all living species evolved over the course of billions of years via the process of natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing? Really? I think it’s more of a case of how the question is phrased, e.g. “the guidance paradox.” If you include the possibility of “divine guidance,” the number goes up to 60%, while the excluding divine guidance, the number is closer to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school of thought has adherents among Jehovah’s Witnesses and some fundamentalist Muslims, but in the United States it has won most converts in the evangelical Christian community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these groups are growing faster than the evangelical Christians?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former president George W. Bush, a born-again Christian, is among those who say evolutionary theory does not fully explain the Earth’s creation, though the ex-president also noted he is not a “literalist” when it comes to the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creationist belief has implications for the way people understand a variety of fields, including biology, paleontology and astronomy, but also impacts questions about climate change and educational debates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, bacteria don’t evolve, so just use that same antibiotic for MRSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Smithsonian Institute, among crowds of weekend visitors, the Liberty University students visited the evolution exhibition,.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And didn’t learn anything…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Darwin’s explanation for why giraffes have long necks — that they evolved over time so they could reach higher foliage — and displays of fossil evidence failed to sway them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I surprised? Of course not, the level of rationalization reaches ridiculous heights among many evangelicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creationism and evolutionism have different ways of explaining the evidence. The creationist way recognizes the importance of Biblical records,” said Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, explain the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the structure of the circulatory system, and the vertebrate eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He teaches his students that dinosaurs were wiped from the face of the Earth some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago during the Biblical flood that Noah survived by building an ark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to millions of years ago…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says carbon-dating techniques that have been used to suggest the Earth is in fact billions of years old are simply not reliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dating? Really? Carbon dating isn’t used beyond 60,000 years or so. That’s cool, though, that it was somehow used to prove the Earth is billions of years old even though it’s &lt;em&gt;extinction&lt;/em&gt; takes less than 80,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t reject one prominent theory that dinosaurs were wiped out by a massive asteroid that collided into Earth, but suggests the collision coincided with the Biblical flood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…and humans were alive then? That’s so cool, because not a single fossil human is found in the same stratum. I mean, find a single fossil anachronism. Find one fossil that is found before it could have evolved. Find Haldane’s “fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Ross acknowledges that the United States is among the most welcoming environments in the world for creationists, he said it can be difficult to convince people to take him and his beliefs seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, there is a reason for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The attitude is when you are a creationist you are ignorant of the facts,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, pretty much. Just because you know all these fossils exist doesn’t mean you know the facts which the modern evolutionary synthesis explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were the quotes epic failures of science, but this article doesn’t even respond to the blatant errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I'm glad to report that electricity has been restored to the Chu-Carroll
household. So now I'm trying to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; During the outage, I got a bunch of questions about the latest news coming
out of the big financial disasters. A major report came out about the failure
of Lehman Brothers, and one thing that's been mentioned frequently is
something called &lt;em&gt;repo105&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The whole repo105 thing is interesting to me, not so much because of what
it actually means, but because of how it's been reported. The term has been
mentioned everywhere - but trying to find any information about just what the
hell it means seems to be next to impossible. It's absolutely amazing how many
places have reported on it without bothering to explain it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/03/financial_shenanigans_the_repo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/03/financial_shenanigans_the_repo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/DG6q-dFBfNo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269025482242"><id gr:original-id="http://www.esa.org/esablog/ecology-in-policy/the-plight-of-hawaiian-birds/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f5a19e87c4fa9f8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The plight of Hawaiian birds</title><published>2010-03-19T14:10:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-19T14:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/gAD4M1PbT78/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.esa.org/esablog/ecology-in-policy/the-plight-of-hawaiian-birds/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Just last week, two Hawaiian bird species from the island of Kaua’i and their respective habitats were put on the endangered species list along with a Hawaiian fly and 45 types of Hawaiian plants.

They thought it was okay for students to recite Christian prayers over the public address system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a young man (who wishes to remain anonymous) &lt;a href="http://www.annistonstar.com/view/full_story/6753350/article-Alexandria-HS-stops-morning-prayers-after-student-complains?instance=home_lead_story"&gt;to challenge the practice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Every day in the morning we would have student-led prayer over the PA system and I looked this up. It’s illegal,” the student said. “It wasn’t just me; there were a bunch of other students who wanted it stopped.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He said he demanded it stop in a voicemail sent to Superintendent Judy Stiefel. He also contacted the American Civil Liberties Union by e-mail and by hand-written letter to complain about the issue.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student requested he not be named in this story because he expected his classmates would not react well to his actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student said he was motivated to take action because he didn’t think it was fair for the student body, which he described as overwhelmingly “fundamentally Christian” to subject all students to Christian prayers and Bible verses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What bothered me about it is that it’s illegal and I don’t want the school breaking the law like that,” the student said. “I want to stand up for fairness. I’m a person that embraces all religion and I love everyone.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure the students know who it is, but that’s besides the point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All it took was one complaint (and the full effect of people who know the law) to get this changed.  Anyone could’ve done it.  You have to wonder why no teacher made it happen (including the tenured ones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments on the &lt;a href="http://www.annistonstar.com/view/full_story/6753350/article-Alexandria-HS-stops-morning-prayers-after-student-complains?instance=home_lead_story"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anniston Star&lt;/em&gt;’s website&lt;/a&gt; are scary.  People think their religion is being trampled upon.  Of course they’re wrong.  Students can pray before school, after school, or even during school as long as they are not disruptive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other students should not be subject to their religious practices.  Public school is not the place for kids to hijack an intercom so they can out-Jesufy the other Christians.  It’s a practice that needs to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

This value is consistent with a variety of experimental measurements, notably the rate in Y chromosomes [&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/08/human-y-chromosome-mutation-rates.html"&gt;Human Y Chromosome Mutation Rates&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A recent paper in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; attempted a direct measurement of the mutation rate by comparing the complete genome sequences of two offspring and their parents. They estimate that each offspring had 70 new mutations (instead of the predicted 130) for a mutation rate of 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; per haploid genome per generation (Roach et al. 2010).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This value is only half of the rate expected from previous results and John Hawks is pretty concerned about that: &lt;a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/genetics/divergence/roach-family-quartet-mutation-rate-2010.html"&gt;A low human mutation rate may throw everything out of whack&lt;/a&gt;. If it's true then the time of divergence of humans and chimps would have to be set at 9 Myr and a lot of studies of recent human evolution could be off by a factor of 2. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think there's any cause for concern because the measured rate in these sequenced genomes is not nearly as reliable as you might think. Most people imagine that it's merely a question of adding up all the differences between the genomes of the two offspring and their parents. Problem is, that number came to 49,720 potential mutations and that's certainly wrong. What to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors checked their data and did a bunch of re-sequencing to confirm the differences. They ended up with 28 confirmed differences in the two genomes. That's too low, so they went back over the data to see if they could find false negatives. After some careful analysis they were able to estimate the false negative rate and adjust the final tally to 70 new mutations in each diploid offspring. (Recall that the calculation based on known DNA replication error rates was 130 mutations per diploid genome per generation.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is how they arrived at their final value of a mutation rate. Given the possible sources of error in the genome sequence data, I don't think we should get too excited about this number. After all, it's only a bit lower than previous estimates. We should be celebrating the remarkable consistency of the data and not the variability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John, you don&amp;#39;t need to re-write your grant—at least not for that reason. &lt;img src="http://bioinfo.med.utoronto.ca/~lamoran/wink.gif"&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roach, J.C., Gustavo Glusman, G., Smit, A.F.A., Huff, C.D., Hubley, R., Shannon, P.T., Rowen, L., Pant, K.P., Goodman, N., Bamshad, M., Shendure, J., Drmanac, R., Jorde, L.B., Hood, L., and Galas, D.J.

&lt;p&gt;As I was explaining at my recent Humanist Contemplatives gathering, it  has occurred to me that one way we can classify spiritual paths (be they  religions, philosophies, traditions, etc) is on how they deal with the  issue of desire and the fears we have about them. After all, if a  spiritual path is about anything it is about obtaining ultimate  happiness, whether you believe that is salvation, nirvana, eudaimonia,  or so on – and a big part of happiness is finding some way to deal with  the discrepancy between what we desire, and what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ways are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can have your cake and eat it too&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These paths tell you that, yes, you can have what you’re wanting most.  One example of this is the so-called &lt;em&gt;Law of Attraction&lt;/em&gt;, as  referred to in Rhonda Byrne’s “The Secret” among many other places.  According to this path, it is claimed that whatever you desire will come  to you if you focus on it positively and strongly enough. This  allegedly happens, not simply because a person who is positive will  perform better, bounce back from misfortune, and not give up. Rather,  the Law of Attraction tells us that our thoughts and attitudes actually  somehow alter the universe so that good things come our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another path that falls into this category are the ‘prosperity gospel’  teachings of preachers like Houston’s Joel Osteen at Lakewood Church.  According to Osteen, Jesus came to the earth so that you might have a  balanced checkbook, and have it more fully filled with funds. He also  came so that you won’t have to suffer the pains of sickness or injury.  Basically, if you believe hard enough and you ask for Jesus’ help, you  will allegedly have material prosperity in this life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More traditional Christians shake their finger at Osteen saying that God  didn’t guarantee an easy life, but came so that your soul might be  saved in the afterlife. Interestingly enough, we find that even old time  Christianity (as well as Islam and many other religions, though not  all) also fall into this category. For those more concerned about their  grave than their gold, these paths guarantee the true adherent  fulfillment of the ultimate desire: immortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, many of these path highlight the importance of various  activities which are designed to help us control the things around us we  may wish to. Perhaps they say we must chant to ward off whatever causes  pain and suffering, or we must pray to ask for favors from powerful  being/s. The desire to control those things we fear are out of our  control is a strong one, so any path that claims to empower us in that  way will always seem appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the major Western religions, and many of its New Age  offshoots, tell their members they can have what they desire most, and  escape what they fear most. One unfortunate side effect of this approach  is that when people fail to get their desired outcome, they are often  left blaming themselves (“I wasn’t faithful enough, didn’t focus enough,  didn’t do x or y”). As far as their delivery of these paths, results  any large number of people can verify range from unknown to  questionable. Either they lie beyond the veil of death and verification,  or they have produced little statistically meaningful evidence of  success. Surely, many report being happy with these reassurances,  depending one one’s definition of ‘happiness’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a second category under which other paths fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can eat your cake, but you can’t have it&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These paths tell us that we live in a vast, turbulent, ever-changing,  and often unpredictable flux of interdependent causation, often outside  of our control. Rather than offer us ways to control it, or offer us  what we desire, these paths address the reasons why we fear our reality,  and help us come to terms with it. They focus on getting us to accept,  internalize, and even see beauty in such a cosmic circumstance. They  attempt to teach adherents how to ‘let go’ of clinging, attachment, and  the myth of permanence and see through the delusions our desires often  create for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to control, rather than offer us rituals, trinkets, or  other methods to know the unknowable and direct the unpredictable, they  work on our ability to ‘go with the flow’ and adapt to the unpredictable  changes that will inevitably happen in life. As for our desires, they  do not attempt to offer us what we desire most, but instead seek to free  us from that desire that we may live without fear of loss or its  unfulfillment. When it comes to blame, these paths seek to assign us  responsibility only for what we truly control, which is our own internal  judgments, priorities, virtues, and choices – not externals which are  the results of many causes beyond ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not difficult for any reader to have guessed which of these paths  this author finds more fruitful. Examples of this second path include  Stoicism and some branches of Buddhism, among many others – much of them  Eastern, but not always. This is one reason I tend to focus on these  philosophies in my own contemplative journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my fellow geeky readers, these influences in the Jedi of Star Wars  fame are well known. Yoda tells Anakin, “Attachment leads to jealousy.  The shadow of greed, that is… Train yourself to let go of everything  you fear to lose…”. Why? As Yoda explained previously to Anakin, “Fear  leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.”  But it  was Yoda’s predecessors who provided many more jewels than this. The  founder of Epicureanism, “Master” Epicurus, revealed this ‘secret’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If thou wilt make a man happy, add not unto his riches but take  away from his desires.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;*****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To my readers: I have been out for a while but it’s good to be back,  thanks for reading! This post has been a quick commentary, just  something I was thinking about recently, but I am working on a better  piece regarding “Stoic Compassion” I hope you will find interesting and  worthwhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A recent article in the New Scientist shines some light on this issue;


    Obesity kills, everyone knows that. But is it possible that we&amp;#39;ve been looking at the problem in the wrong way? It seems getting fatter may be part of your body&amp;#39;s defense against the worst effects of unhealthy eating, rather than their direct cause.


While the article goes on to discuss some interesting new research, I feel the author misses an opportunity to really challenge the overwhelming dogma that too much fat, per se, is the cause of metabolic consequence of obesity. From my experience, it is much easier to get the point across by investigating the obvious anomalies or outliers to the often thought direct relationship between excess adiposity and disease....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image shows some of the numbers of insects estimated to be on public transportation, as reported in a &lt;img title="PIDOMA" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/bullshit.jpg?w=327&amp;amp;h=138" alt="" width="327" height="138"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23811475-cockroaches-and-bedbugs-found-on-trains-and-buses.do"&gt;newspaper &lt;/a&gt;that picked up on a (&lt;a href="http://www.rentokil.co.uk/news/2010-news/news_407418.html"&gt;now expunged of fake numbers&lt;/a&gt;) press release by the company Rentokil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/12/no-bugs-harmed-infested-trains"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; was on the case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“After a bit of prodding, its PR company, Brands2Life, explained: no  buses or trains were studied.&lt;br&gt;
How did people get the wrong end of  the stick? I have no way of knowing, as Brands2Life and Rentokil both  declined to show me what they had sent to journalists but, in any case,  contrary to what was said earlier, these numbers did not come from  measurements and counts – they are based on a “theoretical model.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ben goes on to explain, the assumptions that were made to generate those numbers included an unlimited food supply, completely unchecked reproduction, and survival of roach offspring at 100%.  Which, as anyone who knows anything about biology, is &lt;strong&gt;complete and utter shite&lt;/strong&gt;.  Public transportation is regularly cleaned and fumigated. And they are not filled with an infinite food supply, nor do stampeding commuters never create mortality for little creatures that are trampled.   Any introductory biology class covers &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth"&gt;exponential growth&lt;/a&gt;, and how it is the potential for living populations–but very rarely the reality!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole fiasco was a shameful attempt by either the company, the company’s PR agency, or both, to drum up entomophobia. And, by extension, business.&lt;img title="Zombie Roach" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2007/12/roach-copy.jpg?w=142&amp;amp;h=128" alt="" width="142" height="128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, roaches and bed bugs are a reality. But no, there are not &lt;strong&gt;50 bedbugs&lt;/strong&gt; on the average bus in London!!!  Cripes.&lt;br&gt;
There is an acronym I learned in the dot.com world when I worked there: PIDOMA.  It stands for “Pull It Directly Out of My Ass.”  This is where these numbers came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Rentokil have a history of changing things after the fact, I took screen-shots of their &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/4445169181/in/photostream/"&gt;current blog post&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/4445169207/"&gt;news story&lt;/a&gt;; you can find them at Flickr.  They get a zombie roach, since clearly something has eaten their  brains.  I hope that the &lt;a href="http://www.pestworld.org/"&gt;National Pest Management Association&lt;/a&gt; will issue a statement strongly condemning this company and it’s PR mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also: &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;BEN!&lt;/a&gt; DUDE! Why did you not invite me to the UK to help out with this?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Kristy Anderson (the co-founder of Bruins for Animals), Ashley Smith (the president), and Jill Ryther (the group's advisor) &lt;a href="http://bruinsforanimals.org/?p=violence"&gt;posted a critical response to my post&lt;/a&gt;.  In the spirit of continuing dialogue, I'd like to respond to that response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They write: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
AR activists can rightly accept praise and credit for encouraging the two sides to come together in what was an unprecedented public and civil dialogue. However, one glaring and rather twisted irony too often overlooked is the fact that those very same participants who speak against aggressive campaigns against the animal experimentation industry and who are quick to praise AR advocates' stance on nonviolence are themselves engaged in (or are supporters of) violence and intimidation towards sentient beings on a daily basis.

&lt;p&gt;I’m a high school student, and while my parents know this, my Christian mother insists on sending me to church Youth Group every Friday. It doesn’t really bother me, but submitting to church feels as though I’m submitting to my mother. She believes that this is a “phase” and that it will “disappear” if I keep going to church. Some of my friends know that I’m atheist, but my church friends/acquaintances have no clue. I don’t like telling people about my beliefs because of all their misconceptions and prejudices about atheism. I’ve been struggling with whether I should stop going to church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being an atheist and I’m proud of my beliefs. I feel like I’m a coward for not coming out and continuing to go along with my mother, but being a teenager makes it difficult for people to take my beliefs seriously. I’m a bit scared of how my peers will react and how my mother will react. My church has “presentations” for the preteens, which I used to have to attend. They basically make atheists out to be people in denial who are in a conspiracy to fool the rest of the world into believing in evolution. Needless to say, I didn’t really want to come out then. My mother has always had a tight control on the big decisions in my life (I’m an only child) and I’m afraid that this might elicit a bad reaction from her. She makes it a point to pray for me, pointedly mention God and church in front of me, and leave Christian magazines around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I stop going to church, I feel as though I should come out of the closet, especially because I don’t want to allow my church friends/acquaintances to continue to believe that I’m Christian. I know that word of my atheism will spread throughout the church community and make my family “look bad” in the words of my mother. (My church community is very conservative, and appearances are very important.) I don’t feel that my church acquaintances will understand my beliefs and will either attempt to distance themselves from me after they fail to convert me or take me on as a project of sorts. My church also has a policy that you “cannot be good friends with atheists or gays” lest we “lead good Christians astray onto the path of sin”, so I am afraid that the adults in my church community will discourage their children from speaking to me or getting too close to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my question is: Should I stop going to church? If so, should I come out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br&gt;
Diplomat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Diplomat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a familiar paradox in life, repeatedly portrayed in literature, poetry and song.  Young people, who have a great deal of time before them, are generally impatient, in a hurry to get what they want right now, while older people, whose time is dwindling, are generally very patient, willing to wait for what they want.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that part of the explanation for this is that the older people have learned, often the hard way, that the consequences of getting something you want &lt;em&gt;too soon&lt;/em&gt; can be worse than not getting it at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have received many letters from people of high school age who are eager to “out” themselves to their parents and their communities.  In so many of these letters, they build a very convincing case for the storm of fear, anger, hurt, accusations, slander, unwanted proselytizing, ostracization, persecution, abuse, and financial or even physical abandonment that they will bring down upon their own heads if they announce the simple fact that they don’t believe in the local god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like really good reasons to keep their mouths shut, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other side of their quandary, they say things like, “It’s tearing me up inside to not tell them,” or “I hate feeling like a liar,” or  similarly to your remarks, “I don’t want them thinking I’m still a believer.”  They all share this burning impatience to get it out &lt;em&gt;right now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop for a moment, take a few deep, slow breaths, and take a long, skeptical look at  this imperative urge to bring down the avalanche of trouble that you have so believably described. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From early childhood to around mid twenties, people go through a process called differentiation.  Gradually, children discover that they are not just an extension of their parent’s bodies and minds.  Step by step, they realize that they have their own bodies and minds which can move and think in different ways than those of their parents.  In the teen years this becomes acute, and sometimes those young developing selves seek out controversial ways of asserting their independence just for the sake of asserting it.  It’s natural for them to do this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that your atheism is just a teenage rebellion. I’m sure that it is a firm and real part of your intellect.  It’s the impatience and immediacy I’m asking you to question.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given your mother’s heavy parenting style, I can understand your desire to be free, but don’t sacrifice wisdom in the headlong pursuit of freedom. Your differentiation is progressing along and is inevitable.  There’s no need to get unnecessary bruises in a process that will run its course anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming out as an atheist is what is called a precipitous action. Precipitous as in precipice, as in cliff, as in jumping off.  You set into irreversible motion whatever consequences will happen. You’ll land safely or not, but the thing is done before you land.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like those cliff divers in Acapulco watching the incoming waves, good timing can make a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you really need to take this precipitous step right now?  To come out now, before you have enough financial, social, educational and personal independence firmly established, before you have resources upon which you can fall back, is like jumping out of an airplane without having completely strapped on your parachute or having learned how to operate it.  The plane is not crashing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, every person’s situation is different, and so I’m not advocating a blanket &lt;em&gt;“Wait!! Don’t do it!”&lt;/em&gt; response for all young atheists.  I’m saying have your eyes wide open, and your mind very clear, and your feelings well understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the question you should ask: There are clearly bad consequences for coming out too soon. What would the bad consequences be, &lt;em&gt;if any at all,&lt;/em&gt; for coming out too late? When would “too late” be, if ever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like stopping church attendance is an option for you that will not result in much serious difficulty. If that is correct, then take it. Just don’t link that to coming out to the whole community as an atheist. There’s no logical necessity of the one requiring the other. If people ask you why you’re not attending, you need say nothing more than “It’s just not for me,” or “I’m not interested any more,” or “I’m done with that,” or “It’s time to move on.”  Don’t give them any bait, and they’ll leave you alone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an atheist living in a hostile environment, you don’t “owe” telling this truth about yourself to anyone.  You tell it if, when and to whom it pleases you for your own self interests, period.  If someone assumes you’re a believer like them, so the hell what?  If and when you want to face the slings and arrows that out atheists often do,  then come out and kick ass.  If you don’t want to, there’s no cowardice involved in using discretion.  You’re doing nothing more than taking care of yourself, and no one can condemn you for the strategy that you choose, and you should not condemn yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the reason isn't his vastly greater influence in the skeptical community than mine, his podcast &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org"&gt;The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, or the fact that he gets called a lot more for commentary when something involving quackery versus science-based medicine comes up. He's earned that, having been at this a lot longer than me and under his own name. No, what irritates me is that he somehow manages to get homeopaths to make videos like this trashing him:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funniest thing I’ve ever heard a patient say had to do with fibroids. When I saw the fibroids while ultrasounding her, I pointed them out and started answering her questions. I mentioned that fibroids were more common in African American women and she said (this is a direct quote), “I’m not trying to be funny, but do you think that’s because our men’s penises are so big?” I consider my crowning achievement in life the fact that I did not laugh out loud. When I said I would be skeptical of that, she asked if anyone had every done a study to test that and suggested that I should do the research- she was willing to be a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I’m more inclined to believe the large penis theory or the angry vagina theory. I’ll defer to my tried and true experience: when in doubt, blame the penis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269013852683"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1708757959612295978">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3f8d21f7768dcdc3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Introduction to "The Curious Disconnect"</title><published>2010-03-19T15:02:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-19T15:02:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2010/03/introduction-to-curious-disconnect.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> &lt;br&gt;This is the first of a series of postings by a guest blogger, Arlin Stoltzfus.

He is a Research Biologist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology. Much of his current work focuses on software and databases for evolutionary analysis, in collaboration with an international group of peers interested in improving interoperability. He also does basic research on evolution, and has contributed to our understanding of the history of introns, the origins of complexity, and the role of mutation in evolution. When he isn't doing science or spending time with family, his favorite diversions are playing the piano, bicycling, and martial arts.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction to The Curious Disconnect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arlin Stoltzfus, ©2010 &lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a longish introduction to a series of postings that will be released over the next 6 months or so.  A version of this document with corrections and updated links will be maintained at &lt;a href="http://www.molevol.org/files/cdblog/intro.html"&gt;http://www.molevol.org/files/cdblog/intro.html&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Striking a chord&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The title of this series—The Curious Disconnect—comes from a 2002 article by eminent evolutionary geneticist Allen Orr (Orr 2002), who had broken new ground by developing predictive models of adaptation, and was reflecting on why such models weren&amp;#39;t developed long ago, referring to &amp;quot;a curious disconnect between the verbal theory that sits at the heart of neo-Darwinism and the mathematical content of most evolutionary genetics&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That struck a chord with me. Since the 1990s, I had struggled with a &amp;quot;disconnect&amp;quot; that emerged while I was digesting a think-piece by paleontologists Elisabeth Vrba and Niles Eldredge (Vrba and Eldredge 1984). Among other things, Vrba &amp;amp; Eldredge made the startling suggestion that a key theme of &amp;quot;evo-devo&amp;quot; was that &amp;quot;bias in the introduction of phenotypic variation may be more important to directional phenotypic evolution than sorting by selection&amp;quot;. By 1999 when Constructive Neutral Evolution  appeared (Stoltfus 1999), my thinking had shifted noticeably toward emphasizing 1) the mechanistic distinction between the process of introducing variants and the (separate, subsequent) process of reproductive sorting (selection and drift), and 2) a research program of accounting for non-randomness (in evolution) by invoking both bias in the introduction process, and bias in the sorting process. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;This way of thinking suggested that mutational-developmental bias in the introduction of variation was a general cause of evolutionary bias or direction.  That contradicted two things I knew about evolutionary thinking. First, I knew that the notion of "internal" variational causes of direction, called "orthogenesis", had been rejected as a heresy. Second, I knew that, among contemporary researchers, mutation bias was not seen as a general bias on the course of evolution, but as a special aspect of neutral evolution, incompatible with selection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was confident that Vrba &amp;amp; Eldredge were headed in the right direction, but when I surveyed the theoretical literature, I could not find proof.  Instead, Fisher, Haldane and Wright—the canonical founders of theoretical population genetics—all argued &lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt; a causal link between mutation and the direction of evolution, on the grounds that "mutation pressure" would be overcome by opposing "selection pressure", as in their mutation-selection balance models. Later, when "neutral" thinking became popular, this "opposing pressures" schema was interpreted to mean that mutation-biased evolution is possible, but only when selection "pressure" is absent. This was the conventional wisdom, but I knew it was wrong. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Thus, a few years later, when Lev Yampolsky and I (2001) used computer simulations to demonstrate that bias (mutational or developmental) in the introduction of variation is a possible cause of direction in neutral or adaptive evolution, we were showing a causal link that is both 1) a basic principle of population genetics, and 2) a heresy at odds with the professed views of the founders of population genetics. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;What a "disconnect"! Indeed, the first premise of this blog series is that the "disconnects" in evolutionary biology are not just curiosities, but important  challenges. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deeper into the "disconnect" &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually I came to see these two "disconnects" as parts of the same syndrome. The retarded development of what Orr sees as predictive models of "Darwinian adaptation" is due mainly to the fact that the models are not properly Darwinian. These models (like many used in molecular evolution) treat evolutionary change as a recurring origin-fixation process in which new mutant alleles are introduced, and then individually face acceptance or rejection according to a probability function representing the effect of reproductive sorting.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  Our Darwinian ancestors rejected this kind of "lucky mutant" or "mutationist" framework as anti-Darwinian. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Instead, they were committed to a view in which adaptation takes place at many loci simultaneously on the basis of infinitesimal variation so abundant that the process does not depend on the rate of new mutations. Given such a view, "evolution" can be reduced to shifting the frequencies of alleles already in the "gene pool".  When evolution is redefined in this way, the introduction process disappears and its effects become inaccessible.  This explains the retarded development of the Yampolsky-Stoltzfus model.  &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;Notice that this is not just a matter of &amp;quot;verbal theory&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;mathematical content&amp;quot;. Vrba &amp;amp; Eldredge had a verbal theory that suggested a way to combine causes, and Yampolsky &amp;amp; Stoltzfus demonstrated its implications formally with computer simulations; Wright, Haldane and Fisher had a verbal theory of combining causes that drew on mathematical treatments of mutation-selection balance.  These two conceptions of evolution lead to two different predictions on a major issue. &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;This suggests that there are different theories about the role of variation in evolution, and indeed, there are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having different theories is not a bad thing. In a healthy scientific discipline, one expects different theories to compete with each other for success in prediction and explanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is that this healthy sorting-out process isn't happening. The disconnects mentioned above go back generations. The problem is not that we haven't solved them already, but that we are not consciously and openly engaged in solving them. Rather than having a rigorous and decisive debate to resolve these and other troubling issues, we are bogged down in confusion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wrong Turn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How did things get so muddled? I have a possible explanation. I don't expect you to believe my explanation just yet, because it depends on a lot of arguments that I have not presented yet. However, I need to present this historical hypothesis anyway to provide a context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;The main reason, in my opinion, that the process of science has gone so badly off track in evolutionary biology is the success of the Modern Synthesis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The main reason, in my opinion, that the process of science has gone so badly off track in evolutionary biology is the success of the Modern Synthesis. The Modern Synthesis was simultaneously both a reactionary theory of evolution- lets call it "Darwinism 2.0"- and a progressive socio-political campaign to establish Evolutionary Biology as a discipline with a unifying "modernist" narrative (a claim to subsume all relevant phenomena).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a scientific theory, the Modern Synthesis replaced Darwin's fictional process of "fluctuating variation" with a verbal theory of the "gene pool". Like software engineers trying to re-design a popular application for a new operating system, the architects of the Modern Synthesis re-engineered the mechanistic "back end" of Darwinism to fit Mendelian genetics, but they left the "front end" the same, in order to preserve the familiar "look and feel" of Darwinism 1.0.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mechanistic secret to Darwinism 1.0 was &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;variation on demand&lt;/span&gt;: "altered conditions of life" automatically turn on the flow of variation, producing abundant infinitesimal hereditary fluctuations precisely when (due to the "altered conditions of life") they would be leveraged by selection to build adaptation. Genetics refuted Darwin's theory of fluctuation (along with Lamarck's theory). The "gene pool" theory in Darwinism 2.0 held that Mendelian populations act as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;dynamic buffers of genetic diversity&lt;/span&gt;, so that abundant infinitesimal Mendelian variation is "soaked up like a sponge" and even "maintained", ensuring its constant availability. Thus, in Darwinism 2.0, the evolutionary engine comes with a tank full of fuel that automagically keeps itself full; in Darwinism 1.0, there is no storage tank, but fluctuating variation supplies fuel on demand, directly to the engine. Either way, the abundance of formless infinitesimal "raw materials" ensures that selection may spring into action to build anything, anywhere, anytime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the "gene pool" idea was ingenious, no such reconciliation of Darwinism and genetics was necessary. A century ago, upon the discovery of genetics, scientists began moving rapidly toward a fresh and credible framework combining Mendelian genetics with reproductive sorting. While Darwin had rejected a role for "sports" or mutants on the grounds that they violated his principle of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;natura non facit salta&lt;/span&gt; (nature does not make leaps), early geneticists had no such doctrinal allegiances. With minor exceptions, they were ready to follow the evidence wherever it seemed to be leading, happily embracing dramatic saltations, and just as happily embracing tiny increments of change, depending on where the evidence seemed to point. They did not need to reconcile genetics with Darwinism, only with evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that was not enough for some. And that is when we took The Wrong Turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within a generation, the leaders of the new discipline of Evolutionary Biology were all marching under a flag of unification—and there was no turning back. In hitching itself to Darwinism 2.0, the newly minted discipline of Evolutionary Biology had mortgaged its future to purchase the theoretical analog of a baroque castle. The proud new owners of this castle were not about to knock down any walls, much less to sell the place for something brighter and more open. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science seeks consilience, and gets . . . muck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Science is driven by ingenuity, but its also driven by our aversion to cognitive dissonance. Uncovering and addressing "disconnects" or contradictions or paradoxes results in consilience, e.g., consilience between our intuitive verbal thinking, our mathematical theories, and our experimental results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprises and contradictions invariably emerge in any discipline, and so this process of seeking consilience did not stop just because we underwent a mass conversion to monotheorism. The process continues, not by rejecting inadequate conceptual structures and building new ones, but by treating every challenge as a superficial problem that can be patched up with formless globs of conceptual mud- think of feckless notions like "constraints" or "contingency" or "molecular evolution". "Contingency" is a clumsy attempt to adapt a teleological and deterministic world-view to fit dynamic indeterminism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The notion of "constraints", likewise, is a kludge to adapt an idealized view in which selection chooses from among all that is possible, to fit more closely to the reality that the process of variation renders some possibilities more likely than others. Ideally, we would have a theory that treats variation not as a static precondition, but as a process with kinetics that impose biases on the process of evolution. What we have instead is a concept of "constraint" that, if interpreted literally, is inadequate to cover all but the most extreme cases of variational effects (which typically are not rigid restrictions, but mere quantitative preferences), and if interpreted vaguely enough, can cover anything. Recasting the role of variation in terms of dynamic processes would require major renovations to the baroque castle, and who has time for that? Rather than developing a new view, we have opted for the vagueness and flexibility of "constraints".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, under healthier conditions, &amp;quot;molecular evolution&amp;quot; would have brought down the castle. Remarkably, in the 1970&amp;#39;s, the same clique of influential thinkers (Mayr, Simpson, Dobzhansky, et al) were both 1) congratulating each other for having unified biology—&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;not just evolution, but all of biology&lt;/span&gt;—in the Modern Synthesis (Mayr and Provine 1980), and 2) waging a deliberate campaign to convince biologists that results from molecular comparisons that seemed to fly in the face of this Modern Synthesis were not a direct challenge, because &amp;quot;molecular&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;organismal&amp;quot; represented different &amp;quot;levels&amp;quot; of organization with different metaphysical leverages, one for addressing ultimate &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; questions, and the other for mechanistic &amp;quot;how&amp;quot; questions (Dietrich 1998). Darwinism 2.0 survived due to our willingness to embrace a vapid new catechism: molecular evolution is different (but &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;we still have one theory&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "curious disconnect" is like a major rift or canyon, but its so full of mud that some pandits survey the state of evolutionary biology, and see only solid ground:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any criticism of the synthetic theory that turned out to have some substance was subsumed in a modified version of this theory.  Instead of being a weakness, this ability to change is one of the chief strengths of the synthetic theory of evolution" (Hull, 2002)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is the process of reconciliation at work, and as you can see, sometimes the result is a steaming pile of offal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, the second premise of The Curious Disconnect is that, in the absence of a rigorous reconciliation of "disconnects", what we got instead is just a muddled, non-rigorous reconciliation. As this process continued decade after decade, we got bogged down in the muck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The last "Synthesis" we'll ever need, or want?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Importantly, when I refer above to The Wrong Turn, I do not mean merely that a weak theory emerged with enthusiastic support. That might have been easy to fix-- by simply discarding the theory later-- had it not been for a more subtle shift by which we came to believe that our discipline required a single formalism to encompass everything we do and to provide all the answers to The Big Questions of evolution. We decided that, in order to be legitimate, we had to have an "ism".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One indication that we feel this way is that every few years, one of my colleagues notices that we've outgrown our ism, leaving some embarrassing bits exposed, and proposes to remedy this by calling for a "Newer" or "Extended" Synthesis, or calling on us to "finish" The Unfinished Synthesis. Not only do these proposals imply that 1) we used to have a comprehensive synthesis, and 2) such a synthesis continues to be possible and desirable, they also tend to suggest 3) the next synthesis really is here already, and just needs to be acknowledged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I disagree with all of this, for reasons that I'll explain in subsequent posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For now, I just want to note that this doctrine of monotheorism is an anchor weighing us down. It sets an unachievable standard. It leads us to be embarrassed about the "disconnects" that we have, and to imagine that one new "synthesis" paper is going to set things right again, as though we already have agreed on a new set of answers and all it takes is for someone to state them out loud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contradictions, conflicts and "disconnects" are inevitable. The healthy approach to them is not to pretend that they don't exist, or shouldn't exist, but to confront them, beginning with the process of developing deep awareness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, I'm not going to propose another "synthesis". My primary goal is to raise awareness of problems and to achieve intellectual clarity, not to propose solutions. Once we are aware of the problems, we might all agree on the answers, but I doubt that the answers will be so obvious. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whats ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This posting is just an introduction. I've tried to make three points. The first point is that there are deep "disconnects" or problems in the structure of evolutionary thought that have persisted for decades. Some of these diconnects relate to the role of variation in evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second point is that decades of attempts to rationalize conflicts and rescue decrepit doctrines and prop up the reputations of dead authorities have left us bogged down in confusion. This is not because the scientific issues are necessarily hard (though in some cases they are). Its because of the baggage we are carrying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third point is that a key part of this baggage is the belief that at every point in time all our work has to be subsumed by one great theory that is central to our identity as a discipline. I hope to convince you to reject this way of thinking. &lt;i&gt;The realization that there are major problems to be solved ought to be exhilarating, not embarrassing.&lt;/i&gt; In my view, we should be starting a dialog, not calling for a resolution as though the problems were known and the answers were obvious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, when we wade into the "curious disconnect", we are going to be up our ears in muck that has accumulated for generations. But, we are not going to get bogged down, because we understand the nature of the problem and we aren't going to solve it all at once. We got into this mess primarily by a kind of shallow historical conservatism, preserving old doctrines and old ideas at the expense of conceptual rigor. To get out of this mess, we have to believe that, in science, its better to be clear than to be right. Our rule is going to be "if in doubt, toss it out". For instance, I truly believe that evolutionary theory would be better off if we all stopped invoking "random" and "constraint", immediately, today. "Random" is a constant source of confusion due to evolutionary biologists who are wedded to the doctrine "mutation is random" but who aren't committed to using a standard meaning of "random", and who simply devise a special definition to rescue this doctrine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that sort of muck-raking sounds interesting to you, I hope that you will follow The Curious Disconnect as it unfolds. Below is a list of whats coming up (in no particular order, and subject to change): &lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In a 4-part series, we'll explore &lt;em&gt;The Mutationism Myth&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;     &lt;li&gt;We'll see how a simple verbal ambiguity can cloud our thinking in &lt;em&gt;theory(I) vs. theory(II)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;And we'll go further in this vein in &lt;em&gt;Are there "mathematical" and "verbal" theories?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;       &lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Render unto Selection&lt;/em&gt; we'll practice some ways to make causal attributions when multiple causes are at work &lt;br&gt;       &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creativity and Gradualism&lt;/em&gt; will introduce the topic of Big Questions &lt;br&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Then, in &lt;em&gt;The Big Questions&lt;/em&gt;, we'll consider the scope and explanatory power of evolutionary theories (and be humbled by the results)&lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Mutation and Randomness (and other forms of domness)&lt;/em&gt;, we'll learn how repeating a phrase will keep it alive even if no one knows what it means &lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;What's your favorite popgen?&lt;/em&gt; we'll compare the 3 frameworks that have dominated theoretical evolutionary genetics&lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;I'll discuss Orr's particular "curious disconnect" in &lt;em&gt;When "Darwinian" Adaptation Isn't&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;We'll reject linguistic tyranny in &lt;em&gt;Confronting Your Inner Fascist: what you "must" do&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;You'll learn why I'm not yearning for another "synthesis" in &lt;em&gt;The Last Synthesis We'll Ever Want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;We'll study ways to misinterpret evolutionary biology's simplest and most elegant theory in &lt;em&gt;Misunderstanding the Neutral Theory&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;4 Neutral Theories and 1 Big Misunderstanding&lt;/em&gt; we'll consider the neutral theories of biogeography, molecular evolution, paleontology and ecology&lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, you're saying its all just random?&lt;/em&gt; explains Constructive Neutral Evolution, and some curious responses to it &lt;br&gt;      &lt;li&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Scientific Creationism&lt;/em&gt;, we'll poke fun at the recurring phenomenon of scientific origin theories that push all the interesting stuff so far back in time that the theory has no useful implications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. This origin-fixation framework rose to prominence in the context of "molecular evolution" and the Neutral Theory, but can be traced back to the early work of geneticists such as TH Morgan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. For the sake of simplicity, I'm leaving out the theory originally known as "neo-Darwinism", which we could think of as "Darwinism 1.2". This view, championed by Wallace and Weismann, preceded the Modern Synthesis as well as many early discoveries of genetics, and it particularly emphasized the abundance and universality of infinitesimal variation. While Darwin's original view included acquired effects (a la Lamarck) and direct effects (a la Buffon), neo-Darwinism had only the mechanism of infinitesimal variation plus selection, which was the core of Darwin's theory and his most distinctive contribution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11619919" name="_ref1" title=""&gt;Dietrich, M.

The possibilities for science are exciting… but at the meeting I attended about these rockets, there was something else going on. And as interesting as the science involved with this will be, there was something bigger on everyone’s mind. At the meeting, the electricity about it was palpable, and it was obvious what it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are at the very threshold of easy, inexpensive access for humans to space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At $200,000, a flight to the edge of space is cheap. That’s well within the budget for a lot of people on this planet. Not me personally (dagnappit) but I know people who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; afford that. And hundreds of human beings across the world have signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t make believe. No, this is quite real. So real, in fact, that Alan Stern and Dan Durda, both friends of mine, both astronomers, and both men with their eyes firmly planted on the skies, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hdmkYtekT4"&gt;created this video&lt;/a&gt;. You really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to see this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/1hdmkYtekT4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWNRTpvxRuM"&gt;a followup video&lt;/a&gt; about the training of the first class of citizen astronauts as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic will probably be the first company to launch private citizens into space. They have already sold 300 seats and have deposited $39 million in advance sales! At the meeting, Steven Attenborough with VG said that they expect Space Ship 2 to do a &amp;quot;drop test&amp;quot; (literally be hoisted up to 50,000 feet and dropped by an airplane for a test landing) in the fall of 2010, and undergo its first power tests by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans will then be loaded up and sent into space in 2011. That’s &lt;em&gt;next year&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always lament that we’re past the year 2000 and we still don’t have flying cars. Personally, I don’t trust 95% of the people driving on the ground, let alone in the air. But it doesn’t matter, because the &lt;strong&gt;future is here&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.  Next year, people will be flying into space. Into &lt;em&gt;space&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is beyond cool. This is fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, scratch that. The base root of that word is &lt;em&gt;fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, and this is as real as it gets. While a lot of people have been whining about how the future never comes, my friends and a lot of others will soon be strapping themselves into rockets and making the dreams of Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, and millions of others come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspection of the article reveals that &lt;em&gt;bow&lt;/em&gt; is a transitive verb meaning "cause to take a bow (of metaphorical introduction)", i.e. "introduce".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causative is a regular formation, and a short verb meaning "introduce" has surely been something headline writers wanted for a long time, so why don't we see this more often?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's because causative &lt;em&gt;bow&lt;/em&gt; retains enough of its root meaning to be uncomfortably close to the more traditional causative uses, such as the one that the OED glosses as "To cause to stoop, to crush (as a load does)", as in&lt;/p&gt;

Sci starts feeling a little more motivated, it's finally warm enough to feel comfortable running outside again (not that Sci ran inside, she was just very uncomfortable outside), and it's asparagus season!

When Sci was wee and her mother would try to feed her asparagus, Sci turned up her little nose at such nonsense.  Why on earth would anyone eat something that was that green and looked like it had hair!?

(You can see my issue here)

I seem to remember as a child thinking that asparagus tasted over green and like unripe corn and I was very unimpressed.  But as an adult I have come a real appreciation of this odd vegetable.  You grill it up with some olive oil and spices on...yum.  And so now I look eagerly for those little green bunches at the store.

And it was when I started eating asparagus that I heard about the pee thing.

So today's Friday Weird Science is something that REALLY makes Sci curious.  I mean, usually I just look for things that make me laugh.  But now I'm on a quest, I want to KNOW!

It's time for some weird and Historical (historical enough) science:

There are preachers who don't believe. That's what Dennett's study explored in a recent study.&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PZ Meyers had this to say:&lt;blockquote&gt;Dan Dennett has been studying the phenomenon of preachers who don't believe what they preach, and the paper and commentary are available at the Washington post. Strangely, the newspaper has headlined it as "Skeptical clergy a silent majority?", which is odd — the work doesn't attempt to quantify how many unbelievers there are in the ministry, but is more of a case study of those they've found…and since they are only describing the in-depth interviews of five people, it's absurd to try and draw conclusions about proportions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's interesting stuff, but utterly unsurprising to atheists. These are people who entered the ministry out of a sincere desire to do good in the world, and as they delved into religious scholarship, they discovered they couldn't believe anymore…but hey, they were still humane and concerned about their fellow human beings. They're also concerned about what will happen to their income if they leave the church, and what will happen to the opinion others have of them. And they engage in some difficult and twisty rationalizations for their situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One other interesting point is that several of them came to their atheism by way of reading books by Ehrman and Spong, and also Harris and Hitchens. These works do make a difference. Unfortunately, we also learn that while they have received enlightenment, they're very, very reluctant to share that shameful knowledge with their congregations, and continue to reassure them about belief in god.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, the Washington Post couldn't just put up Dennett's bombshell on its own: they've surrounded it with a confusing cloud of commissioned articles to answer the question, "What should pastors do if they no longer hold the defining beliefs of their denomination?" Most of them are believers, except for Rebecca Goldstein and Tom Flynn and Herb Silverman, and most of them are making excuses. You just knew that someone would make the inane argument that "doubt is part of faith." No, it's not. Faith is the blunt instrument used to crush doubt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The comments on Dennett's article are also fascinating. There are people who are quite upset about his revelation. And there is even a Cracker Catholic there, claiming that an atheist priest at communion turned a wafer into a hunk of bloody meat — therefore, god, apparently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just watch. This is news that will provoke protests and complaints and lots of excuses. I hope it also encourages more ministers to come out of the closet and face reality, instead of making it their profession to obscure the truth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You can read the study for yourself &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/Non-Believing-Clergy.pdf"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a Washington Post story on it &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/daniel_c_dennett/2010/03/skeptical_clergy_a_silent_majority.html"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8558797228149291364?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, however, owing to budget cuts and staffing cuts and things like that, there will be no science fair at the sprogs' elementary school.  We are wistful about this, especially after the fun we had at their science fair &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/05/friday_sprog_blogging_science_3.php"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sunday, January 17 at 9-10:05am 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Science online talks between generations&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/blugger" title=""&gt;Beatrice Lugger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/PM_09_Nobel_Laureate_Meeting_2009__Follow_the_Proceedings_Online.AxCMS" title=""&gt;Christian Rapp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: In huge meetings around the world several organizations try to initiate a dialogue between top scientists and young researchers -the &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de"&gt;Lindau Meetings of Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; are one of them providing numerous opportunities for an exchange of ideas and thoughts between young researchers and Nobel Laureates. The idea is to support this dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. We'd like to discuss how one can initiate a continued communication process even between two meetings. Which internet/social web tools might be useful to bridge the communication habits of a younger generation with that of an older generation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is if one can organize such a dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get some impressions of the Lindau Nobel Laureates meeting itself please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/WebHome.AxCMS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, click through the archives, read in the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/MeetingReports.AxCMS"&gt;annual reports&lt;/a&gt; and take a look at the actual list of &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de/PublicParticipants.AxCMS?Meeting=278&amp;amp;Usergroup=6742"&gt;Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; who are expected to join the next meeting (the participation list of young researchers will be online by the end of April 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to promote the scientific communication between generations. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/video/lindau2009/index.html"&gt;Five short films&lt;/a&gt; presented by Nature Video, show some kinds of such a dialogue. Join Laureates and young researchers as they discuss the future of medicine, consider the ethics of nanotechnologies, plan new collaborations, and seek ways to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely there also exists a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/2009/06/exemplifying-apprenticeship-the-lindau-meetings.php"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting and we are acitve on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/LindauNobelLaureatesMeeting"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lindaunobel"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Till now the traffic on these plattforms abruptly drops down after the meetings and grows up some weeks before the next one. We'd like to find new ways to encourage a continuous dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It is an excellent review of common errors in using and thinking about statistics in science. But it is frustrating because Siegfried frames his article as a problem with “science” – as if his criticisms are criticisms of science itself, rather than the failings of individuals. At times he also writes as if the problems with statistics that he points out are fatal flaws or “some” researchers are just now starting to take into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, from my perspective statistics are a very complex and challenging field. Most scientists I know have a moderately sophisticated understanding of statistics, many know far more of statistics than I, although some apparently less. However, most large studies consult with statisticians who are experts in statistical analysis. The primary difficulty is with interpreting studies once they are published (even when the paper itself gets the statistics correct).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the specific problems Siegfried points out have been widely known for years, and those researchers with a better understanding of statistics have been taking them into account for as long as I can remember. Most of them I learned about in medical school at the hands of researchers and experts in public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all that aside – Siegfried does provide an excellent review of common mistakes interpreting statistics in research, especially medical research. The article is worth a thorough read, but I will give some highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most common error is the misinterpretation of the meaning of statistical significance, often stated mathematically as the p-value. Often the p-value is described as the probability that the results of the study were due to chance alone, so a p-value of 0.05 means that there is only a 5% chance that the study results are a false positive. But this is not an accurate description of p-value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, the p-value says that if we assume the null hypothesis (no effect) what are the odds of getting the results of the study or greater. This may seem like a subtle difference (and it is) but it’s important. This is not the same thing as saying there is a 95% chance that positive results reflect a real effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, statistical significance does not account for the rigor and quality of the study. It assumes no bias or flaws, and it does not account for other statistical flukes that could alter the results (such as poor randomization – see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, the p-value of an individual study was never meant to be the final arbiter of what is true in science. Kimball Atwood has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=2996"&gt;already written an excellent review&lt;/a&gt; of this question over at Science-Based Medicine. You should give that a read as well – but quickly, the point is that a Bayesian analysis is more appropriate. In other words, we begin with a prior probability of a claim being true based upon all existing research. We can then add to that the results of the current study to arrive at a post-probability. So a study with a 95% significance may still only increase the probability of a treatment working from 5% pre-probability to 10% post-probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to look at this is that you cannot interpret a single study in terms of whether or not a treatment works, and Siegfried makes this point as well.  You have to put in into the context of prior research (sound familiar?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other common problems in statistic as well. Siegfried points out the common problem of multiple analysis – if you look at 20 variables, one of them will achieve a p-value of 0.05 on average even if we assume the null hypothesis. But this is an old problem, long ago solved by using statistics designed to account for multiple analysis. In fact readers of this blog and SBM have likely encountered this before as a criticism of uncritical analysis of some studies. The take home lessons is – always ask yourself, how many different comparisons did the researchers do (different variables, different points in time, different outcome measures) and did they cherry pick those that were positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is randomization – this is an important aspect of clinical trials. Randomization means that people were assigned at random to either the treatment group or the control group. The purpose of this is to avoid selection bias, but also to average out as many variables as possible. So you want to get equal numbers of people with red hair in each group, and randomization should take care of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Siegfried points out that there is no guarantee that randomization will do this – it may be unlikely, but you can still flip 10 heads in a row. If you think about all the unknown variables, chances are some of them will be unequal in the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly why we are so concerned with the size of trials – how many subjects were in the trial. Because randomization gets more and more effective with larger and larger numbers (you may flip heads 10 times in a row, but not a thousand times). Multiple trials also help – chances are random flukes won’t be the same across multiple trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, there is a process called stratification – with known variables, like age, sex, and race, you can make sure equal numbers get into each treatment group and not rely upon randomization. (But we have to rely on randomization for unknown variables.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis is just another tool of modern science – it is part of the technology of science. And like all things, there is a wide variation in quality and understand across individuals, and what filters down to the public is generally oversimplified to the point of being wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I applaud efforts to educate the public about the proper use of statistics, and to educate scientists and professionals for quality control. But Siegfried could have framed his article more as – here are some common mistakes to avoid and how to fix them, rather than – science is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit this can be challenging. I lecture on how to interpret the medical literature, where I cover many of these points, and often I get questions from the audience such as – “So you’re saying that most of science is wrong?” When actually what I am saying is that many individual studies are wrong, and studies are often misinterpreted. And further you have to base conclusions on the literature, not individual studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the technology of scientific studies is used properly, they work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1269007252055"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/friday_cephalopod_not_as_cute.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d9b778ceeafc8ee4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Not as cute, but deadlier</title><published>2010-03-19T13:17:40Z</published><updated>2010-03-19T13:17:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/CT05YXj6LtE/friday_cephalopod_not_as_cute.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/friday_cephalopod_not_as_cute.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So maybe you need a fix of the real thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://newhumanist.org.uk/1530/sanal-edamaruku"&gt;Sanal Edamaruku&lt;/a&gt; wrote about &lt;em&gt;Death on air – the night a guru tried to kill him live on Indian TV:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even if you don’t live in India it is possible you have seen my encounter with supreme tantrik “power” in March. Since it was broadcast it has been posted on YouTube and has had a good many views. “More than the candidates of the presidential election,” joked the reporter from US National Public Radio when I was interviewed the other day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The YouTube video that was originally linked no longer features. You can, however, watch a differently hosted version of the film where &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJVUbpF8Mg"&gt;Edamaruku faces down Pandit Surendra Sharma.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a lousy headline, implying that the above video is new. It isn’t, but some of the following items are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This week India’s most popular yoga master, Baba Ramdev, announced plans to  launch a political party, promising to cleanse India of corruption and  introduce the death penalty for slaughtering cows. Then, on Wednesday,  police arrested a couple in Maharashtra state on suspicion of killing five  boys on the advice of a tantric master who said their sacrifice would help  the childless couple to conceive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The immediate goal I have is to stop these fraudulent babas and gurus,” says  Mr Edamaruku, 55, a part-time journalist and publisher from the southern  state of Kerala. “I want people to make their own decisions. They should not  be guided by ignorance, but by knowledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Dido Green of Tel Aviv University’s School of Health Professionals developed an innovative yet remarkably simple series of therapeutic exercises for children and young adults based on sleight-of-hand tricks used by professional magicians.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bioacoustician &lt;a href="http://www.wildsanctuary.com/"&gt;Bernie Krause&lt;/a&gt; has recorded the amazingly rhythmic vascular systems of thirsty trees!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;He discovered that the cells in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylem"&gt;xylem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phloem"&gt;phloem&lt;/a&gt; of the tree fill with air to try to maintain the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure"&gt;osmotic pressure&lt;/a&gt; that’s usually produced by the sucking of water up through the roots.  At a certain point the cells burst. Krause adds “When they pop, they make a noise: we can’t hear it, but insects can. And when insects hear multiple cells popping, they’re drawn to the tree because certain ones are programmed to expect sap. And when the insects are drawn to the tree, the birds are drawn to the tree to eat. it’s all a microhabitat formed by sound: The sound of popping cells.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Attention can be focused or it can be diffused. Attentional focus has been shown to be affected by mood or affect; with positive affect leading to a broadening of attentional focus;  and negative affect, in general been shown to be associated with a narrowing of focus.

&lt;p&gt;Cosmopolitan popster Mika is a great showman and tours with a great band. The audience at his gig in Stockholm last night was thoroughly charmed by the friendliness and musical mastery on offer. Mika traces his musical ancestry back to acts like the Beatles, Queen, Elton John and George Michael, which would make for a good concert experience even if the front man didn't say a word. But he also entertained us with effortless improvised stage patter -- part of it in &lt;i&gt;Swedish&lt;/i&gt;, even though he makes only a single stop here on his tour! Psychedelic animated backdrop projections and dancers in outlandish costumes reminded me of of Montreal's stage show. And Mika's studio-heavy pop translated beautifully to the live format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audience was unusually all-ages for a pop gig and there was a fine mix of hipsters and everyday Joes like myself. It may have been my imagination or my selective Darwin-determined gaze, but there seemed to be unusually many of the big girls whose beauty one of Mika's hits extols. Myself, I brought 11-y-o Junior and his buddy, and they loved it - which was great since neither of them had been to a pop concert since they learned to walk. Both study music, and it wouldn't surprise me if they ended up on stage at similar events in the 2020s. We're laying the groundwork now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mika has only two albums on his discography so far. But seeing him on stage last night I felt that this guy has it in him to be doing this for decades. A hard-working musician of great talent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up-and-coming Swedish pop act &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/olajoyce"&gt;Ola Joyce&lt;/a&gt; opened together with his 6-piece band, and they did a fine job too. An album is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if Darwin’s theory of evolution – or, at least, Darwin’s theory  of evolution as most of us learned it at school and believe we  understand it – is, in crucial respects, not entirely accurate? Such  talk, naturally, is liable to drive evolutionary biologists into a  rage, or, in the case of Richard Dawkins, into even more of a rage than  usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe Burkeman’s insistence that popular notions about evolution are all wrong is just journalistic puffery.  So what is the new finding that overthrows Darwinism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several definitions of “epigenetics” (it once meant simply “development”), but Burkeman uses the term in its more modern sense as “inheritance not based on coding changes in the DNA.” Burkeman cites a couple of recent studies in which nongenetic, developmentally caused changes in an organism (like alterations in physiology due to starvation) can be passed on to one or two generations of  its descendants.  The offspring of stressed Swedish chickens, for example, have difficulty navigating mazes. He gives another two-generation example of epigenesis from humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thin evidence, apparently, is why modern evolutionary theory is wrong.  And so Burkeman gets in another slap at not only Dawkins, but Daniel Dennett:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As years of bestselling  books by Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and others have seeped into the  culture, we’ve come to understand that the awesome power of natural  selection – frequently referred to as the best idea in the history of  science – lies in the sheer elegance of the way such simple principles  have generated the unbelievable complexities of life. From two  elementary notions – random mutation, and the filtering power of the  environment – have emerged, over millennia, such marvels as eyes, the  wings of birds and the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It not be immediately obvious why this has such profound  implications for evolution. In the way it’s generally understood, the  whole point of natural selection – the so-called “modern synthesis” of  Darwin’s theories with subsequent discoveries about genes – is its  beautiful, breathtaking, devastating simplicity. In each generation,  genes cause random mutations, making offspring subtly different from  their parents; those mutations that enhance an organism’s abilities to  thrive and reproduce in its own particular environment will tend to  spread through populations, while those that make successful breeding  less likely will eventually peter out.  Yet epigenetics suggests this  isn’t the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say to this is: “Profound implications my &lt;em&gt;tuchus&lt;/em&gt;!” There are a handful of examples showing that environmentally-induced changes can be passed from one generation to the next.  In nearly all of these examples, the changes disappear after one or two generations, so they couldn’t effect &lt;em&gt;permanent&lt;/em&gt; evolutionary change.  The proponents of epigenesis as an important factor in evolution, like Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb, always wind up talking about the same tired old examples, like cases of &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v447/n7143/full/nature05913.html"&gt;coat color change in mice and flower pattern in toadflax&lt;/a&gt;.  I am not aware of a single case in which an &lt;em&gt;adaptive&lt;/em&gt; change in an organism—or any change that has been fixed in a species—rests on inheritance that is not based on changes in the DNA. (For a refutation of the pro-epigenesis arguments that Jablonka and Lamb make in their 2005 book, see Haig [2007].)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some examples of “nongenetic” inheritance that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have adaptive significance, such as differential methylation of paternal versus maternal chromosomes, ultimately rest on changes in DNA that promote that differential methylation. And this “inheritance” lasts only one generation, for the methylation profile is reset in each sex every generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the very few cases of one- or two-generation inheritance that cause nonadaptive changes in the phenotype stands the very, very large number of studies in which inherited changes within and among species &lt;em&gt;map to the DNA&lt;/em&gt;.  These include every case of evolutionary response to artificial or human-generated selection, adaptive changes within species (e.g., spiny-ness in sticklebacks), and differences among species in both morphology (e.g., the color differences in fruit flies I study) and reproductive barriers (the many mapping studies of “hybrid sterility” and “hybrid inviability” genes). Burkeman, of course, doesn’t mention these cases: it would ruin his nice story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look just at studies of the inheritance of organismal  changes that have evolved over time (and many of these &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have detected profound epigenetic effects), the score would be something like this:  DNA  757, Epigenesis 0. (I’m just making these numbers up, of course, to make a point.)  If we look at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; “inherited changes”, regardless of their evolutionary importance, we would have a handful of epigenetic changes versus literally thousands of DNA-based changes.  So how can Burkeman say that epigenesis will &lt;em&gt;profoundly&lt;/em&gt; revise our view of evolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m not saying that epigenesis was &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; unimportant in evolution.  Prions (cases in protein shape that don’t reflect changes in protein sequence), for example, could be considered cases of epigenetic inheritance, and might have played a role in the evolution of some species.  What I am saying is that there is virtually no evidence that epigenetic inheritance has been &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; in evolution, and that the phenomenon seems, at this point, seems too infrequent to warrant rethinking the tenets of neo-Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burkeman notes that epigenetic inheritance appears to refute one of the prime tenets of evolutionary psychology: the idea that DNA-based changes in human behavior evolved by natural selection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, if epigenetics and other developments are coming to suggest  that environment can alter heredity, the very terms of the debate – of  nature versus nurture – suddenly become shaky. It’s not even a matter of  settling on a compromise, a “mixture” of nature and nurture. Rather,  the concepts of “nature” and “nurture” seem to be growing meaningless.  What does “nature” even mean if you can nurture the nature of your  descendants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve been a critic of the excesses of some evolutionary psychologists, but it’s simply insane to dismiss that field—and, by extension, the entire field of behavior genetics—because there is some thin evidence for inheritance of acquired traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, Burkeman got wind of Jerry Fodor and Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini’s new book, &lt;em&gt;What Darwin Got Wrong&lt;/em&gt;, a profoundly misguided critique of natural selection. Burkeman notes, correctly, that the book has met with fierce opposition from philosophers and biologists, but insists that it still has value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be jawdroppingly surprising, to say the least, were Fodor to be  right. A safer, if mealy-mouthed, conclusion to draw is that his work  acts as an important warning to those of us who think we understand  natural selection. It’s probably not a bankrupt concept, as Fodor  claims. But nor should laypeople assume that it’s self-evidently simple  and exhaustively true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probably&lt;/em&gt; not a bankrupt concept? &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt; self-evidently simple? (It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;—that’s one of its beauties!) Not exhaustively true? (What does that mean? Is there any explanation for adaptation other than natural selection? Fodor has certainly never given one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burkeman’s article represents the most self-serving, lazy, overblown, and irresponsible strain of science journalism.  He lays out strong charges against modern evolutionary biology, and then doesn’t bother to consult a single expert to see if those charges stick.  He touts epigenesis to the skies, but doesn’t bother to find out whether its proponents may have exaggerated its evolutionary importance. (That wouldn’t have required much digging!)  Burkeman apparently lacks the ability to adjudicate claims and controversies in biology.  Granted, we don’t expect all journalists to be able to do this, but if you don’t know what you’re talking about, you ask the experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Burkeman is not even a science writer—he’s a “features” writer. What business does he have telling the public that everything they know about evolution is wrong? He appears to be motivated far more by an animus against Richard Dawkins, and a desire to write catchy and sensationalistic science journalism, than by a desire to get the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burkeman is an ignorant fool.  He belongs not at the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; but on page 3 of the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;, where he can exaggerate and hyperventilate to his heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;:  The Guardian is backpedaling: there’s been a rebuttal piece posted on the &lt;em&gt;Guardian’s &lt;/em&gt;own &lt;em&gt;Comment is Free&lt;/em&gt; site (for the link, see Matthew Cobb’s comment #15 on this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009775" title=""&gt;The Spread of Sleep Loss Influences Drug Use in Adolescent Social Networks&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Troubled sleep is a commonly cited consequence of adolescent drug use, but it has rarely been studied as a cause. Nor have there been any studies of the extent to which sleep behavior can spread in social networks from person to person to person. Here we map the social networks of 8,349 adolescents in order to study how sleep behavior spreads, how drug use behavior spreads, and how a friend's sleep behavior influences one's own drug use. We find clusters of poor sleep behavior and drug use that extend up to four degrees of separation (to one's friends' friends' friends' friends) in the social network. Prospective regression models show that being central in the network negatively influences future sleep outcomes, but not vice versa. Moreover, if a friend sleeps ≤7 hours, it increases the likelihood a person sleeps ≤7 hours by 11%. If a friend uses marijuana, it increases the likelihood of marijuana use by 110%. Finally, the likelihood that an individual uses drugs increases by 19% when a friend sleeps ≤7 hours, and a mediation analysis shows that 20% of this effect results from the spread of sleep behavior from one person to another. This is the first study to suggest that the spread of one behavior in social networks influences the spread of another. The results indicate that interventions should focus on healthy sleep to prevent drug use and targeting specific individuals may improve outcomes across the entire social network.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009774" title=""&gt;The Young, the Weak and the Sick: Evidence of Natural Selection by Predation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is assumed that predators mainly prey on substandard individuals, but even though some studies partially support this idea, evidence with large sample sizes, exhaustive analysis of prey and robust analysis is lacking. We gathered data from a culling program of yellow-legged gulls killed by two methods: by the use of raptors or by shooting at random. We compared both data sets to assess whether birds of prey killed randomly or by relying on specific individual features of the prey. We carried out a meticulous post-mortem examination of individuals, and analysing multiple prey characteristics simultaneously we show that raptors did not hunt randomly, but rather preferentially predate on juveniles, sick gulls, and individuals with poor muscle condition. Strikingly, gulls with an unusually good muscle condition were also predated more than expected, supporting the mass-dependent predation risk theory. This article provides a reliable example of how natural selection may operate in the wild and proves that predators mainly prey on substandard individuals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009751" title=""&gt;Estimating the Potential for Adaptation of Corals to Climate Warming&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The persistence of tropical coral reefs is threatened by rapidly increasing climate warming, causing a functional breakdown of the obligate symbiosis between corals and their algal photosymbionts (Symbiodinium) through a process known as coral bleaching. Yet the potential of the coral-algal symbiosis to genetically adapt in an evolutionary sense to warming oceans is unknown. Using a quantitative genetics approach, we estimated the proportion of the variance in thermal tolerance traits that has a genetic basis (i.e. heritability) as a proxy for their adaptive potential in the widespread Indo-Pacific reef-building coral Acropora millepora. We chose two physiologically different populations that associate respectively with one thermo-tolerant (Symbiodinium clade D) and one less tolerant symbiont type (Symbiodinium C2). In both symbiont types, pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed significant heritabilities for traits related to both photosynthesis and photoprotective pigment profile. However, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays showed a lack of heritability in both coral host populations for their own expression of fundamental stress genes. Coral colony growth, contributed to by both symbiotic partners, displayed heritability. High heritabilities for functional key traits of algal symbionts, along with their short clonal generation time and high population sizes allow for their rapid thermal adaptation. However, the low overall heritability of coral host traits, along with the corals' long generation time, raise concern about the timely adaptation of the coral-algal symbiosis in the face of continued rapid climate warming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009708" title=""&gt;Putting Culture Under the 'Spotlight' Reveals Universal Information Use for Face Recognition&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eye movement strategies employed by humans to identify conspecifics are not universal. Westerners predominantly fixate the eyes during face recognition, whereas Easterners more the nose region, yet recognition accuracy is comparable. However, natural fixations do not unequivocally represent information extraction. So the question of whether humans universally use identical facial information to recognize faces remains unresolved. We monitored eye movements during face recognition of Western Caucasian (WC) and East Asian (EA) observers with a novel technique in face recognition that parametrically restricts information outside central vision. We used 'Spotlights' with Gaussian apertures of 2°, 5° or 8° dynamically centered on observers' fixations. Strikingly, in constrained Spotlight conditions (2° and 5°) observers of both cultures actively fixated the same facial information: the eyes and mouth. When information from both eyes and mouth was simultaneously available when fixating the nose (8°), as expected EA observers shifted their fixations towards this region. Social experience and cultural factors shape the strategies used to extract information from faces, but these results suggest that external forces do not modulate information use. Human beings rely on identical facial information to recognize conspecifics, a universal law that might be dictated by the evolutionary constraints of nature and not nurture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009506" title=""&gt;Statistical Analysis of the Indus Script Using n-Grams&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Indus script is one of the major undeciphered scripts of the ancient world. The small size of the corpus, the absence of bilingual texts, and the lack of definite knowledge of the underlying language has frustrated efforts at decipherment since the discovery of the remains of the Indus civilization. Building on previous statistical approaches, we apply the tools of statistical language processing, specifically n-gram Markov chains, to analyze the syntax of the Indus script. We find that unigrams follow a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution. Text beginner and ender distributions are unequal, providing internal evidence for syntax. We see clear evidence of strong bigram correlations and extract significant pairs and triplets using a log-likelihood measure of association. Highly frequent pairs and triplets are not always highly significant. The model performance is evaluated using information-theoretic measures and cross-validation. The model can restore doubtfully read texts with an accuracy of about 75%. We find that a quadrigram Markov chain saturates information theoretic measures against a held-out corpus. Our work forms the basis for the development of a stochastic grammar which may be used to explore the syntax of the Indus script in greater detail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009666" title=""&gt;Calculation of Disease Dynamics in a Population of Households&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early mathematical representations of infectious disease dynamics assumed a single, large, homogeneously mixing population. Over the past decade there has been growing interest in models consisting of multiple smaller subpopulations (households, workplaces, schools, communities), with the natural assumption of strong homogeneous mixing within each subpopulation, and weaker transmission between subpopulations. Here we consider a model of SIRS (susceptible-infectious-recovered-suscep​tible) infection dynamics in a very large (assumed infinite) population of households, with the simplifying assumption that each household is of the same size (although all methods may be extended to a population with a heterogeneous distribution of household sizes). For this households model we present efficient methods for studying several quantities of epidemiological interest: (i) the threshold for invasion; (ii) the early growth rate; (iii) the household offspring distribution; (iv) the endemic prevalence of infection; and (v) the transient dynamics of the process. We utilize these methods to explore a wide region of parameter space appropriate for human infectious diseases. We then extend these results to consider the effects of more realistic gamma-distributed infectious periods. We discuss how all these results differ from standard homogeneous-mixing models and assess the implications for the invasion, transmission and persistence of infection. The computational efficiency of the methodology presented here will hopefully aid in the parameterisation of structured models and in the evaluation of appropriate responses for future disease outbreaks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009754" title=""&gt;High Levels of Miticides and Agrochemicals in North American Apiaries: Implications for Honey Bee Health&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent declines in honey bees for crop pollination threaten fruit, nut, vegetable and seed production in the United States. A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007-08 growing seasons. We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60% of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one systemic pesticide, and over 47% had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide. In bee pollen were found chlorothalonil at levels up to 99 ppm and the insecticides aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid, fungicides boscalid, captan and myclobutanil, and herbicide pendimethalin at 1 ppm levels. Almost all comb and foundation wax samples (98%) were contaminated with up to 204 and 94 ppm, respectively, of fluvalinate and coumaphos, and lower amounts of amitraz degradates and chlorothalonil, with an average of 6 pesticide detections per sample and a high of 39. There were fewer pesticides found in adults and brood except for those linked with bee kills by permethrin (20 ppm) and fipronil (3.1 ppm). The 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in mixtures up to 214 ppm in bee pollen alone represents a remarkably high level for toxicants in the brood and adult food of this primary pollinator. This represents over half of the maximum individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. While exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_262.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/KDa9FGVymYE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268998818017"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22536">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c76edf6566b46d5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Interviews"/><title type="html">Interview with Eric Kaufmann, Author of Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?</title><published>2010-03-19T11:00:24Z</published><updated>2010-03-19T11:00:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/19/interview-with-eric-kaufmann-author-of-shall-the-religious-inherit-the-earth/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Religious fundamentalists have a lot of babies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don’t even have to be fundies.  I mean, there’s clearly something in holy water that makes a Catholic woman’s uterus extra-powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;shared an excerpt&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Kathryn Joyce&lt;/strong&gt;’s book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807010707?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0807010707"&gt;Quiverfull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that really haunted me.  It described a patriarch’s long-term plans for his family:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One of Geoffrey Botkin’s catchiest contributions to patriarchy is his branding of the dominion vision in his “two-hundred-year plan for multigenerational faithfulness”: a concept that started as an Excel spreadsheet he put together stretching from his marriage in 1980 to his projected death, in 2038, to the culmination of his vision in 2180.  It has since become a cornerstone of the Vision Forum message and the focus of a new three-day ministry conference teaching Vision Forum followers to emulate Botkin’s ambitious plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Botkin’s personal plan plots major family accomplishments on his Excel sheet — both completed and those they aim for, such as books published, films made, churches planted — and priorities are set out for the family that will unfold over the course of generations: a thorough listing of goals set down for generations of children yet unborn.  The generations themselves are projected as well: Botkin’s sons (still unmarried) are listed with their projected marriage dates, the projected births and number of their children, and their projected deaths.  His grandsons and great-grandsons are charted as well until two hundred years’ worth of Botkin heirs and accomplishments have accumulated.  At the end of his two-hundred-year plan, Botkins estimates that he’ll have been the patriarch of some 186,000 male descendants, all of whom, he is confident, will begin their own two-hundred-year plans modeled on Botkin’s ideals…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(p. 229)

&lt;p&gt;Scary, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Kaufmann&lt;/strong&gt; has been thinking about this problem for a while now.  He believes that religious fundamentalists will grow/breed even more rapidly this century — especially in the West.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new book explaining his theory is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1846681448?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1846681448"&gt;Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent article about the book in the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; (UK) carried the headline: “&lt;a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100029971/atheism-is-doomed-the-contraceptive-pill-is-secularisms-cyanide-tablet/"&gt;Atheism is doomed: the contraceptive Pill is secularism’s cyanide tablet&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaufmann graciously agreed to do an interview for this site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, I ask him whether atheists should be having more babies (because I’d *totally* volunteer to help out), whether his thesis is wrong because studies show &lt;em&gt;increases&lt;/em&gt; in the percentage of non-religious people (at least in the US), and whether this religious baby-making trend will change in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;How did you become so interested in this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My background is in studies of national identity and ethnic conflict. In my previous books, I focused on Canada, the United States and Northern Ireland. In all cases, the changing ethnic makeup of the population is a major issue and has at different times contributed to ethnic conflict. Having lived much of my life in Vancouver and London, I have always been aware of rapid ethnic change. Having said this, assimilation has the power to break down ethnic differences. But with religion, the assimilation process requires secularisation, which is not so automatic. In the US, for example, the pot melted Catholics and Jews with Protestants, but the division between fundamentalists of all religions and seculars remained, and has solidified into the battle lines of the so-called ‘culture wars’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do fundamentalists have so many babies?  Is this a relatively recent trend?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentalists have large families because they believe in traditional gender roles, pronatalism (‘go forth and multiply’) and the subordination of individualism to the needs of the religious community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it recent? Yes. First, when we all lived on the land, had no contraception and poor medicine and sanitation, most people — pious or otherwise — needed to have large families to survive. Now, family size has been freed from material constraints by urbanisation, modern medicine and contraception. So values come to the fore, and seculars express their values in smaller families while fundamentalists resist the trend. Fundamentalists don’t actually have more kids than they used to, but nearly all survive, and their relative advantage over others grows. It’s also worth mentioning that fundamentalism is a modern (post-1850 or post-1900) trend: a reaction against secularism or secularised (read: moderate) religion that has become more intense since the 1960s sexual revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are fundamentalists concerned with the prospect of an overpopulated earth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No — they feel God will provide and consider such concerns ‘anti-people’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any way to convince fundamentalists to have fewer children?  Do you think the trend will change in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are different species of fundamentalist. The more open ones, such as pentecostalists or neo-evangelicals, are only slightly above average when it comes to fertility. So it is really the closed fundamentalists, like the ultra-Orthodox Jews, Salafi Muslims, or even many Mormons and neo-Calvinist Protestants, that one has to worry about. And here I think there is an explicit determination to set one’s face against modernity. So fertility is unlikely to fall. This is something quite different from, say, traditional Catholic or Muslim fertility, both of which were high for ethnocultural reasons but have fallen with integration into mainstream society. I think one can try and lean on fundamentalists by flagging up an ethic of planetary and civic responsibility, but this will probably fall on deaf ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this trend occurring in certain parts of the world only?  Where?  Within certain faiths?  Which ones?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend is more advanced in the developed world, where urbanisation, contraception and modern medicine have reached their height. The pattern is most immediate and intense within Judaism where the ultra-Orthodox are already a significant share (over 10 percent) of the population and have three or four times as many children as liberals and seculars. But even within Christianity and Islam, fundamentalists have twice the family size of seculars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do most of the children born into these religious families remain in the faith?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. First off, stronger religions retain members more effectively than moderate faiths because when you leave a fundamentalist religion, you leave your entire life — family, friends, leisure — behind, not just one compartment. Moreover, retention rates have been rising as fundamentalists have become better organised and began to harness modern technologies of communications, media and record keeping, which help weave a whole world around their members. I use the analogy of nations, which became institutionalised into our contemporary system of nation-states with the delineation of borders, maps, censuses and bureaucracies. That gave them better retention and fixity. So too with fundamentalist religious sects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are atheists having fewer babies than “average” or are we simply not keeping up with the religious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the evidence is pretty clear that atheists have spearheaded the trend toward below-2.1 children which is now universal in the developed world. So it’s a case of everyone having fewer, but the relative gap between religious and secular widening. When the religious have 2 and atheists 1, that’s a 100 percent advantage. 4 versus 3, which might have been the case a generation or two ago, is only a 25 percent advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This trend of “quiverfull” Christian families and large Catholic families (to name a couple) has been around for a while… And yet, the percentages of non-religious people keep increasing according to recent polls.  Does that contradict your thesis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The composition of a population is always a product of the relative pace of secularisation and religious growth. I use the analogy of a treadmill. Seculars are running on a treadmill that is tilting up and moving against them because of their low fertility and immigration. The religious — notably fundamentalists — are standing still or walking backward, but their treadmill is pushing them forward and tilting downhill. So in Europe in the late twentieth century, seculars were running fast enough to overcome their demographic disadvantage and overtook the faithful. But today, secularism is slowing down outside England and Catholic Europe, and is facing a more difficult incline from the treadmill of demography. London is a good example: it is more religious now than 20 years ago despite secularisation, simply because of religious immigration and fertility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should atheists start having more babies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough question. My instinctive answer would be ‘yes’, but this would only be effective if immigration were reduced and religious fundamentalists responded to calls for smaller families, which is unlikely. There is also the matter of global warming to worry about — we don’t want a population footrace with fundamentalism. So in the end, the most promising course is to somehow attract more people away from fundamentalist religion, no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What information do you hope readers take from your book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m interested in generating a debate about the impact of our global demographic turmoil, what &lt;strong&gt;Jack Goldstone&lt;/strong&gt; recently termed the ‘New Population Bomb’, on the ideological direction of our societies. Most people assume that events, policy debates and cultural currents are the main influence on where our societies go. &lt;strong&gt;Francis Fukuyama&lt;/strong&gt; assumes that the end of the Cold War, the failure of socialism and the spread of liberal-democratic values will lead to an ‘End of History’. I don’t discount culture and politics, but in a post-ideological, post-heroic age, slower-moving forces such as demography can come to the fore and generate powerful social changes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At 2pm on Tuesday, 23 March, &lt;a href="http://www.libelreform.org/news/447-libel-reform-campaign-urgent-next-steps"&gt;the Libel Reform coalition&lt;/a&gt; has organized a mass lobby at the House of Commons, and you should be there. I will!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s our best chance to put real, in-person pressure on the government before the election. The more people who show, the better able we’ll be to show MPs that &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?s=libel"&gt;libel reform&lt;/a&gt; has serious support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can just show up and be counted, but the best thing to do is to contact your MP directly and let them know they should meet you there. Here’s all the info from the Libel Reform Campaign . . . I hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Find out who your MP is,&lt;/strong&gt; and their contact details, here: www.theyworkforyou.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Email them or write to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify yourself as a constituent – give your postal address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell your MP: I will be coming to the House of Commons on Tuesday 23rd March at 2 pm for a meeting on libel law reform in Committee Room 15. I would like to meet you at that meeting or afterwards in the Central Lobby between 3 pm and 4pm to find out where you and your party stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Turn up on the day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen on the day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come to the Cromwell Green entrance to the Houses of Parliament. You will have to allow about 20 minutes to pass through security and to get to Committee Room 15 between 2 and 3pm. We will hear from high profile Champions of the campaign on why the political parties need to commit to reform libel laws which are unjust, against the public interest and an international menace and, we hope, from spokespeople for the parties on justice matters. Your MP may be there if you wrote to them. We can ask them en masse what they are doing to get a manifesto commitment for libel law reform or you can ask them personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually your MP will reply to your email agreeing to meet you in central lobby or apologising for not being around (you should ask to meet their researcher in that case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you can come and if your MP agrees to meet you by emailing news@libelreform.org This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it . The House sits from 2 until 10 pm on Tuesday. If you can only come in the evening please let us know – if there is enough demand we will do something then as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The election in the UK is expected to be on Thursday 6th May so Parliament will rise very soon. This is our only chance for a mass lobby to change these archaic, restrictive laws.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*I keep using “UK” to refer to this issue and several people have complained that it is an English issue and Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have nothing to do with it. It’s my understanding that the coalition also needs all UK constituents to pressure their representatives, and that’s why I continue to use the more inclusive term.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268997059834"><id gr:original-id="http://drdeborahserani.blogspot.com/2010/03/brazil-yogurt-is-at-it-again-another.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c337cac423253443</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Brazil Yogurt Is At It Again: Another Fat Campaign</title><published>2010-03-19T06:10:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-19T06:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/PEfEVJwq3Rw/brazil-yogurt-is-at-it-again-another.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://drdeborahserani.blogspot.com/2010/03/brazil-yogurt-is-at-it-again-another.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Fat discrimination seems to be running rampant these days.

Her exact words, if you will recall, were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are groups out there that insist that vaccines are responsible for a variety of problems, despite all scientific evidence to the contrary. We (the office of Secretary of Health and Human Services) have reached out to media outlets to try to get them not to give the views of these people equal weight in their reporting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing offensive there, just a request that the media try not to yield to the temptation to indulge cranks. Now, remember how I described her little screed as being based on a straw man so massive that it could be the set piece for a remake of &lt;em&gt;The Wicker Man&lt;/em&gt;? I think I may have found someone who surpassed her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet Ralph Fucetola, who goes by the 'nym &lt;a href="http://www.vitaminlawyer.com"&gt;Vitamin Lawyer&lt;/a&gt;. See someone who can delve even deeper into the crazy than Wright.

That&amp;#39;s the message from one of the first studies to look at people&amp;#39;s preferences for different forms of advice. Reeshad Dalal and Silvia Bonaccio presented hundreds of students with fictional decision-making scenarios, such as choosing which job to apply for. The students were offered various permutations of advice and asked to say how satisfied they&amp;#39;d be if a friend had given them that advice. The different kinds of advice were: which option to go for; which option not to go for; info on how to make the decision (e.g. use a points allocation system); information on one or more of the options; and sympathy about the difficulty of making a decision. Whilst all forms of advice were positively received, the students&amp;#39; consistent preference was for information about one or more of the options.A second study spiced things up by introducing more varied decision-making scenarios: where to locate a new store; how to lay off excess staff; and how to invest some inheritance. A fresh batch of students were presented with the new scenarios and this time they were to imagine they&amp;#39;d solicited the advice from an expert, rather than a friend, to see if this made any difference to their responses. Information again came out as the most preferred form of advice. However, this time round, specific advice on which option to go for was also particularly well received, especially in the investment scenario. The researchers said past research on advice giving has tended to focus purely on advice in the form of &amp;#39;I recommend option X&amp;#39;, so this study makes a novel contribution. &amp;#39;Across the situational and dispositional variables we examined, decision-makers appeared to want their advisors to provide information about the alternatives,&amp;#39; the researchers said. Advice that says &amp;#39;go for option X&amp;#39; can also be well-received but only in specific circumstances, such as when advice has been explicitly solicited from an expert.When it comes to lessons for real life, Dalal and Bonaccio said more research was needed to see how their results generalise, but in the meantime they advised: &amp;#39;Individuals who are advising decision-makers should at the very least be careful to provide information along with their recommendations.&amp;#39;_________________________________Dalal, R., &amp;amp; Bonaccio, S.

&lt;p&gt;In spite of what the entertainment industry would have you believe, it is extremely difficult to save the life of someone in cardiac arrest.  A few random breaths, slow rocking chest compressions, even the ever-so-dramatic overhand blow to the chest accompanied by the scream “Don’t you die on me, dammit!” are unlikely to successfully resuscitate someone following an arrest, and even if it does, they won’t be in any shape to go chase Locke across the island with Jack and Kate five minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18675023"&gt;properly performed CPR&lt;/a&gt;, started within seconds of an arrest, in a hospital with all the required expertise and support equipment, only roughly half survive their initial arrest event.  Even fewer (25-33%) survive to discharge from the hospital, and ~75% have a good neurologic outcome.  For &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20123673"&gt;arrests out of the hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where there can be huge delays in treatment, mere survival is significantly lower, often measured in the single digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Limitations Of CPR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why doesn’t CPR save more people?  Well, it really isn’t meant to; at least, not on its own.  Cardio-respiratory arrest is the common pathway of death, but it isn’t in itself a diagnosis.  The essential question to be answered is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; someone stopped breathing, or &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; their heart stopped in the first place.  Unless you can answer that question and address the problem, even if CPR manages to restore a heartbeat it’s likely to stop again in short order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clearly unrealistic though to expect a random bystander to diagnose and treat another random stranger who happened to arrest in their vicinity.  The rescue breaths and chest compressions of CPR are therefore primarily designed to buy time, hopefully enough time to get to the EMTs and Emergency/Critical Care team whose job it is to figure out what caused the arrest in the first place and reverse it before permanent damage is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the availability of public CPR training courses and the widespread knowledge of the existence of CPR, most people remain untrained, and the vast majority of those who have been trained (even medical personnel) rarely have cause to think about the skill, much less practice it.  The result is that complete novices in CPR are the first responders to the overwhelming majority of arrests.  Should we be surprised, then, that in no more than half of all arrests is &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8210731"&gt;CPR provided by bystanders&lt;/a&gt;, and that the quality of CPR when it is given is often sub-par?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t mean that as an indictment of innocent bystanders of an arrest.  Simply witnessing an arrest is traumatic enough; to be in such a situation and asked to recognize the emergency, remember distant and somewhat arcane training, to have the initiative and courage to step forward and act, and to do so quickly and effectively is an immense amount to expect from anyone.  Nevertheless, if the goal is to reduce the amount of time a victim of an arrest is without circulation, we needed to find some way to enable more people to provide quality CPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K.I.S.S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to reduce these impediments to good CPR delivery, combined with improved understanding of the physiology of people during arrests and CPR, led the American Heart Association (AHA) to make some significant revisions to its &lt;a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3035517"&gt;CPR guidelines in 2005&lt;/a&gt;.  The revised guidelines were notably more streamlined, focusing less on tools, drugs, and advanced skills used by professionals, and even reducing the emphasis of breathing to focus instead on simply maintaining circulation of blood.  Instead of a variety of age stratified ratios of compressions to rescue breaths, the AHA began to teach a single universal guideline for single bystander CPR: 30 compressions at a rate of 100/minute, then 2 breaths, then repeat until either help arrives or the person is breathing on their own.  Compared to the prior CPR guidelines, it was simpler, easier to remember, and easier to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 this was simplified even further.  For adult cardiac arrests, it was &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378619"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that “compression-only” or “&lt;a href="http://handsonlycpr.org/"&gt;hands-only&lt;/a&gt;” CPR was equally effective to CPR using both compressions and rescue breathing, yet was simpler, even easier to remember, had fewer interruptions, and eliminated the aversion to mouth-to-mouth that some people experience.  All of this is thought to make people more likely to intervene and provide quality CPR, improving the odds of a dire situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it may seem counterintuitive not to provide rescue breaths for someone in cardio-respiratory arrest, the rationale is solid.  “Deoxygenated” or venous blood still has a good amount of oxygen in it (usually about 75% of oxygenated blood), and it carries a lot more than just oxygen.  The blood content of the nutrients that cells require is largely the same no matter whether the blood has been oxygenated or not, and blood flow also removes harmful metabolic byproducts that build up rapidly in its absence.  Though breathing is necessary in the long run, but you can get by without breathing a lot longer than you can survive without blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have confirmed that “compression-only” and conventional CPR are equally efficacious in adult cardiac arrests, and that the “compression-only” method is &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18656300"&gt;easier to learn and remember&lt;/a&gt;.  By reducing the complexity of CPR to something that essentially fits on a bumper sticker, we are likely to improve the overall odds for adults who arrest out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…But Maybe Not &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Simple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have we made it too simple though?  &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19273724"&gt;Children arrest too&lt;/a&gt;, but for very different reasons than adults.  Most kids suffer respiratory arrests that then cause cardiac arrest, not primary cardiac arrests like most adults.  Eliminating rescue breathing from childhood resuscitations could in fact result in worse outcomes.  The AHA and medical community at large are aware of this, which is why the “compressions-only” CPR has not been recommended for children.  Even so, it is likely that in advocating for “compression-only” CPR to benefit adults, some children will inadvertently be subjected to sub-optimal CPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20202679"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; out of Japan and published last month in The Lancet provides some sobering but powerful information that may guide future CPR guidelines.  The investigators examined all arrests of children over a 3-year span in Japan, documenting the type of arrest, presence and type of CPR, and short and long-term outcomes among other measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 5158 childhood arrests, 2719 (53%) had no CPR attempted by anyone prior to EMS arrival.  Survival rates were abysmally poor without CPR at ~7% alive one month after arrest.  Though still depressingly low, CPR significantly improved survival to ~11%.  Of equal importance, those above 1 year of age who did get CPR, &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;type of CPR, also had markedly better odds of having favorable neurologic function at one month from the arrest.  As with the adult experience, an arrest out of the hospital is a dire situation, but any type of CPR is better than nothing, and can have a marked improvement in the (unfortunately small) likelihood of having a positive outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern I had, however, was whether inappropriate “compression-only” CPR was &lt;em&gt;inferior&lt;/em&gt; to conventional CPR with both compressions and rescue breaths, and whether we need to keep this in mind when designing our CPR program for the public.  The authors of this study were able to make just such a comparison.  Both forms of CPR were equally effective when the arrest had a cardiac origin, just as we’ve seen in adults.  However, as suspected, victims of arrests of a non-cardiac origin provided “compressions-only” CPR did no better than those given no CPR; only the combination of compressions and rescue breathing affected a significant benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, of the 2,439 children who did receive CPR, 36% received “compression-only” CPR.  Since 71% of all of the arrests in this study were non-cardiac in origin, this means that 25% of the CPR administered was inappropriate and ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this study has limitations in being observational in design, and there are obvious issues generalizing from the Japanese population to that of the US, among other smaller concerns.  Nevertheless, this study provides a few important lessons to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it shines the harsh light of reality on the overly optimistic expectations of CPR sometimes provided but the news media and frequently by the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it demonstrates the efficacy of CPR in improving both survival and the quality of outcomes from out of hospital arrests, and the potential benefits of further enabling the public to perform appropriate CPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it reinforces the decision of the AHA to restrict “compression-only” CPR to adults with suspected cardiac arrest, and not to apply it to children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it seems to validate my concern that the introduction of “compression-only” CPR &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be detrimental to the pediatric population.  Recall that the two CPR techniques were equally efficacious in adults (and apparently children) with an arrest of cardiac origin.  The AHA has therefore assumed that there was no detriment to the further simplification of the CPR guidelines, while yeilding a theoretical benefit derived from better quality of compressions and a greater percentage of bystanders willing and able to provide CPR.  If, however, “compression-only” CPR is only equal to conventional CPR in the adult population yet generates a negative impact on the quality of CPR provided to children, the AHA may choose to reconsider the wisdom of advocating “compression-only” CPR.  Obviously, this is still an open question, and further studies are needed (and are currently being performed), but I am curious how this information may affect the new guidelines due for release late 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will continue to refine the CPR guidelines to improve the outcomes from out of hospital arrests using the best available science, but the largest area for improvement is in the number of people in the community trained and willing to perform basic CPR.  It’s cheap, it’s easy, and the classes are actually fun.  Though you will hopefully never use the skill, you have the ability to help save a life.  Please, if you are at all inclined, &lt;a href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3012360"&gt;get CPR certified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is going to be a short one. I’ve written about the amazing invisibility cloak media hype before. &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100318/ap_on_sc/us_sci_cloak_of_invisibility"&gt;It’s back in the news again&lt;/a&gt; and again there’s absolutely nothing new to report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Germany’s  Karlsruhe Institute of Technology report they were able to cloak  a tiny bump in a layer of gold, preventing its detection at nearly  visible infrared frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, did they?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tiny bump in a layer of gold?! They turned it invisible?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOW, THAT’S SO INCREDIBLY–hmm, what’s the opposite of exciting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Grimm’s fairy tales to Harry Potter, the cloak of invisibility has  played a major role in fiction. Now scientists have taken a small but  important new step toward making it reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! It IS like Harry Potter. . .only you know, boring. Kids will be thoroughly thrilled about having the ability to cloak  a tiny bump in a layer of gold, preventing its detection at  nearly  visible infrared frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think the all the amazing practical applications that will have. We’ll finally be able to hide pennies! Wait, what? That’s copper? Never mind.&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/yup-its-that-time-a-year-for-another-invisibility-cloak-story/"&gt; Just read what I wrote the last time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is to achieve beams circulating at 3.5 TeV, bringing collisions between protons to 3.5+3.5=7 TeV center-of-mass energy. This would be the highest particle energy ever accomplished by humans (nature somehow routinely manages to produce cosmic rays at energies 8 orders of magnitude higher!). This news is hot off the press: we had a talk today by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyn_Evans"&gt;Lyn Evans&lt;/a&gt;, and he gave us the latest update. He should know what’s going on, since he’s &lt;a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/organigr2007_1EDMS371495.pdf"&gt;project leader of the LHC&lt;/a&gt;. Evans shared some entertaining anecdotes from the last few years of commissioning, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://petermccready.com/portfolio/08082005.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/03/lhc_hall_1.jpeg" alt="LHC tunnel (photo by Peter McCready)" title="LHC tunnel (photo by Peter McCready)" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluid"&gt;superfluid&lt;/a&gt; helium to cool the superconducting magnets. One of the many weird properties of this stuff is that it has zero viscosity. Which means that, if there’s any sort of hairline fracture anywhere in the 27 kilometer long tunnel, the stuff comes spewing out, and very, very &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/09/19/lhc-first-magnet-failure/trackback/"&gt;bad things happen&lt;/a&gt;. Every component, every joint, every one of the tens of thousands of tiny connections has to be perfect. It is this sort of failure which brought the machine to its knees shortly after commissioning, over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnets are kept very, very cold; the superfluid helium is at 1.9 Kelvin (-271 Celsius), or a couple of degrees above absolute zero. We’re not talking a little vial in a laboratory being kept at this temperature. We’re talking many thousands of tonnes of magnets, kept just above absolute zero (using 96 tonnes of liquid helium). As things cool down, they naturally contract. The decks on bridges do the same thing, hence those serrated grills at the ends of bridges to absorb the expansion and contraction due to weather (if you’ve ever motorcycled across a bridge, you know exactly what I’m talking about). There are equivalent serrated joints in the LHC beam pipe to ensure that it doesn’t contract and rip open upon cooling (which, needless to say, would be bad). But upon reheating a section of the LHC, it turned out some of these devices left little fibers in the beam tube. Not good. How to find them, without ripping open the entire collider (costing millions of dollars and setting the project back precious months)? They ended up blowing a ping pong ball (with electronics embedded) down the tube, and tracking where it would get stuck. A simple, elegant, cheap solution to fix a multi-billion dollar enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while during the construction they ended up with roughly a billion dollars worth of superconducting magnets being stored in a parking lot at CERN. For reference, this is comparable to the entire &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)"&gt;GDP&lt;/a&gt; of many small countries (Bhutan, Guyana, Burundi, etc.), sitting out in the rain and snow. Big science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully sometime in the next few days they’ll be running at 3.5 TeV. Apparently it’s been slow going because the system to prevent catastrophic quenching of the magnets (which is what “broke” the machine previously) is on a hair-trigger, setting off all sorts of false alarms (and when it goes off it quenches the magnets [in a controlled manner]). You can keep track of the progress on the &lt;a href="http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/"&gt;LHC webpage&lt;/a&gt; (clicking on the image of the ring gives real-time data on the temperature of the magnets). Although this would be the highest energy ever achieved, it still &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/11/30/the-lhc-surpasses-the-tevatron-in-energy-but-what-about-power/trackback/"&gt;doesn’t significantly surpass the science reach of Fermilab’s Tevatron&lt;/a&gt;, since the latter has run for many years (albeit at a lower energy of 1 TeV+1TeV). Both energy and (integrated) luminosity matter in this game, and the Tevatron has gotten more than 8 inverse fb (femtobarns; one of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_(unit)"&gt;best units in all of science&lt;/a&gt; [think "there's no way to miss it, it's as big as a barn"]). The LHC is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2010/01/29/decision-for-the-lhc-1-inverse-fb-at-7-tev-or-bust/trackback/"&gt;shooting for 1 inverse fb&lt;/a&gt;. All being well, in a few months they’ll bump the energy up to 5 Tev on 5 TeV. This should significantly open up the scientific discovery space, and could conceivably kick off the next revolution in particle physics. Exciting times!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s not enough that smoking causes all manner of cardiopulmonary complications, or that more than 3,000 chemicals and heavy metals have been identified as additives. Now comes evidence that tobacco particles extracted from cigarettes contain markers for hundreds of known bacteria. Lung infections in some smokers may be caused by germs on shredded tobacco, rather than the act of smoking itself.

According to a report by Janet Raloff in Science News, Amy Sapkota and a team of researchers at the University of Maryland screened tobacco flakes from cigarettes for bacterial DNA using known markers. In an online paper for Environmental Health Perspectives, the scientists explored the bacterial metagenomics of cigarettes using standard cloning and sequencing processes. The team provided evidence for the presence of Campylobacter (a cause of food poisoning), E. coli, several Staphylococcus varieties, as well as a number of bacteria, such as Clostridium, which is directly associated with pneumonia and other infections. Fifteen different classes of bacteria in all, with no significant variation from one cigarette brand to another.  

The time has come, Sapkota and coworkers conclude, “ to further our understanding of the bacterial diversity of cigarettes,” given the more than 1 billion smokers worldwide.  Smoking is now recognized as a risk factor for a basketful of respiratory illnesses, including influenza, asthma, bacterial pneumonia, and interstitial lung disease. In light of this, the authors have advanced their study as solid evidence that “cigarettes themselves could be the direct source of exposure to a wide array of potentially pathogenic microbes among smokers and other people exposed to secondhand smoke.”

In 2008, researcher John Pauly and coworkers at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, helped provide early evidence by conducting a tobacco flake assay and publishing the results in the journal Tobacco Control. The scientists opened a package of cigarettes “within the sterile environment of a laminar flow hood. A single flake of tobacco was collected randomly and aseptically from the middle of the cigarette column and placed onto the surface of a blood agar plate. The test cigarettes included eight different popular brands, and these were from three different tobacco companies.”

And the results? “After 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C, the plates showed bacterial growth for tobacco from all brands of cigarettes. Further, more than 90% of the individual tobacco flakes of a given brand grew bacteria.” Pauly believes that “the results of these studies predict that diverse microbes and microbial toxins are carried by tobacco microparticulates that are released from the cigarette during smoking, and carried into mainstream smoke that is sucked deep into the lung.”

In a recent study published in Immunological Research , Pauly and others expanded on their findings, writing that “Cured tobacco in diverse types of cigarettes is known to harbor a plethora of bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative), fungi (mold, yeast), spores, and is rich in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide).” This time out, the researchers conclude that “lung inflammation of long-term smokers may be attributed in part to tobacco-associated bacterial and fungal components that have been identified in tobacco and tobacco smoke.”

Cigarette manufacturers already use antibacterial washes during the curing process in order to reduce infection by fungi and bacteria.

If the findings are sound, they could place the argument over secondhand smoke in a vastly different light—cigarettes smoke may be taking the rap for respiratory infections cause by extant bacteria. With smoking rates in the U.S. holding at a steady 21 percent of the population, the issue is not trivial.

Strangely, the newspaper has headlined it as &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/daniel_c_dennett/2010/03/skeptical_clergy_a_silent_majority.html"&gt;"Skeptical clergy a silent majority?"&lt;/a&gt;, which is odd — the work doesn&amp;#39;t attempt to quantify how many unbelievers there are in the ministry, but is more of a case study of those they&amp;#39;ve found…and since they are only describing the in-depth interviews of five people, it&amp;#39;s absurd to try and draw conclusions about proportions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting stuff, but utterly unsurprising to atheists. These are people who entered the ministry out of a sincere desire to do good in the world, and as they delved into religious scholarship, they discovered they couldn&amp;#39;t believe anymore…but hey, they were still humane and concerned about their fellow human beings. They&amp;#39;re also concerned about what will happen to their income if they leave the church, and what will happen to the opinion others have of them. And they engage in some difficult and twisty rationalizations for their situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other interesting point is that several of them came to their atheism by way of reading books by Ehrman and Spong, and also Harris and Hitchens. These works do make a difference. Unfortunately, we also learn that while they have received enlightenment, they're very, very reluctant to share that shameful knowledge with their congregations, and continue to reassure them about belief in god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the WaPo couldn't just put up Dennett's bombshell on its own: they've surrounded it with a confusing cloud of commissioned articles to answer the question, "What should pastors do if they no longer hold the defining beliefs of their denomination?". Most of them are believers, except for Rebecca Goldstein and Tom Flynn and Herb Silverman, and most of them are making excuses. You just knew that someone would make the inane argument that "doubt is part of faith." No, it's not. Faith is the blunt instrument used to crush doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments on Dennett&amp;#39;s article are also fascinating. There are people who are quite upset about his revelation. And there is even a Cracker Catholic there, claiming that an atheist priest at communion turned a wafer into a hunk of bloody meat — therefore, god, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just watch. This is news that will provoke protests and complaints and lots of excuses. I hope it also encourages more ministers to come out of the closet and face reality, instead of making it their profession to obscure the truth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/priests_who_dont_believe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/mF9F114G5EA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268958170004"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/the_animal_research_experience.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf031ae1baab67b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The animal research experience</title><published>2010-03-19T01:34:39Z</published><updated>2010-03-19T01:34:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/dY2pXUs3eqI/the_animal_research_experience.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/the_animal_research_experience.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Lese of the Ituri Forest raise food in gardens, and they exchange various things for wild animal meat hunted by the Efe (Pygmy) foragers with whom they live in close economic and social association.

The article states that it&amp;#39;s not clear why this seems to be the case. I briefly reviewed the original meta-analytic paper (the pdf can be found here) and saw that the research team accounted for 1) the emotion recognition tasks used, 2) the medication the participants were on, and 3) the existence of depression as possible moderatoring variables for the impairment in emotion recognition. They suggest that &amp;quot;the likely cause of this deficit is pathology in neural circuits involved in emotion recognition, particularly within basal ganglia structures including the ventral striatum and STN.&amp;quot; This tentative speculation is all fine and dandy, but it doesn&amp;#39;t really provide an explanation for why people with PD have this particular deficit in the first place. They rule out comorbid depression and visualspatial impairment, but go on to postulate that Lewy bodies disease, an abnormal amount of protein found inside the nerve cells of many PD patients, may be affecting their visual cortex, therefore affecting their emotion recognition abilities. Too bad there&amp;#39;s no shred of evidence found in the research literature for this hypothesis (they make sure to note this).  What I found surprising what that they made no mention of sleep disturbances&amp;#39; possible moderating role in explaining their findings. Drawing from my previous entry on sleep deprivation&amp;#39;s deleterious affects on emotion recognition, maybe it&amp;#39;s the fact that people suffering from PD commonly have concomitant sleep problems, therefore leading to their emotion recognition impairment. Numerous studies have shown that PD significantly affects rapid eye movement sleep behavior leading to a variety of cognitive impairments (Massicotte-Marquez et al., 2009, Norlinah et al., 2009, Seugnet et al., 2009,). We now also know that REM sleep is crucial in the processing of emotional memory (Nishida, 2008). And like I said before, sleep deprivation takes a heavy toll on emotion recognition functioning (van der Helm, Gujar, &amp;amp; Walker, 2010). Sleep seems to account for much of our emotional life! In light of the aformentioned studies, it makes the most sense that sleep deprivation would be the more likely pathway to emotional recognition impairment in people with PD; not working memory dysfunction as the authors suggest. There may be many potential sources for interpersonal difficulties in PD individuals. Perhaps future sleep treatment can help prevent such difficulties from ever occurring. Just a  thought...

&lt;p&gt;He spoke at the &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org"&gt;Freedom From Religion Foundation&lt;/a&gt;’s convention last November and &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/publications/freethought-today/articles/the-goodness-of-godlessness/"&gt;a transcript of his talk is now available online&lt;/a&gt; in the most recent issue of &lt;em&gt;Freethought Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, he listed (in no particular order) the Top 10 good things about being godless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secularity is on the rise in the U.S. and throughout much of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Godless people and secular people are less sexist, less chauvinistic and much more supportive of women’s rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are more tolerant and accepting of others not like us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are better educated and maybe even a little bit smarter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The godless are less homophobic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are more moral and more ethical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atheists experience and enjoy more oral sex than religious people do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are better parents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there are a lot of us in one place or one nation or one state or one group, the result is societal success and well being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re just better looking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, some of those items are tongue-in-cheek, some are debatable, and some are very serious.

That&amp;#39;s the conclusion that Edbert Hsu (Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions) and colleagues reached after a painstaking trawl of news reports in the world&amp;#39;s English-language media.The real toll is probably even higher, of course, but the data were enough to allow Hsu to work out the characteristics of the most lethal stampedes. They found reports on 215 stampedes, of which 49 occurred at sporting events, 25 at musical events, 38 were political and 41 were religious. The rest (totalling 60) were due to a mixed bag of causes and were mostly spontaneous.And the award for the most lethal type of stampede goes to... religious ones! In simple terms of the number of fatalities per stampede, religious events come out over double that of their closest rival.The simple comparison is not a very fair, however. Religious stampedes take place in different parts of the world (often in the Middle East, which is the most dangerous place to be in a stampede), often in low income nations (also very dangerous), and often outdoors (slightly more dangerous than indoor stampedes).But even when you take all this into account, religious stampedes still come out on top of the lethality stakes - but sporting stampedes are so close as to make it a photo finish.There&amp;#39;s one other factor that contributes to the lethality of a stampede, and that&amp;#39;s the size of the crowd. Unfortunately, Hsu was only able to determine the size of the crowd in 130 cases.But even taking into account crowd size, religious stampedes are still pretty dangerous. When you look at fatality rate (i.e. deaths per crowd member), they&amp;#39;re 6 times riskier than stampedes at sporting events.But with with crowd size taken into account, religious stampedes drop into third place. The riskiest kind of stampede by a long way are the spontaneous ones (because of the lack of crowd control), followed by political ones.The explanation for all this is fairly simple. Religion is the one event that brings together truly massive crowds, often in settings that are poorly controlled.One of the most lethal stampedes in recent history occurred in Iraq in 2005, when nearly 1000 people died when fears of a suicide attack sparked panic. In the same year, over 250 died (out of a crowd of 400,000) when Hindu worshippers set fire to shops.But the biggest contributor is the annual Hajj, which these days draws crowds in excess of 2 million. Five of the  biggest stampedes in the past100 years occurred in Mina Valley, Saudi Arabia, during the Hajj.Over the past 3 decades, nearly 3,000 people have been killed in stampedes during the Hajj - the last big disaster being in 2006. With crowds that big, I suppose the surprise is that there are so few casualties!Hsieh, Y., Ngai, K., Burkle, F., &amp;amp; Hsu, E. (2009).

The crescent-shaped line in the line drawing represents the bite of a large shark, with the red portions representing damage done directly to the bone. From Bianucci et al, 2010.

Shark attacks are events of speed and violence. When they have locked on to a prey item sharks seem to come out of nowhere, and though they can be quite gentle with their jaws (as on occasions when they are unsure about whether something is food or not) their ranks of serrated teeth can inflict a devastating amount of damage. They are not the cruel, vicious, or bloodthirsty villains they have often been portrayed as, but instead are exquisitely-adapted predators which rely on their ability to catch and consume a variety of prey. And, just as it is among present day sharks, so it was among their prehistoric relatives.

Between 19 and 8 million years ago Maryland's Calvert Cliffs were covered by the ocean. Those shallow waters were inhabited by at least fifteen different genera of sharks, and their teeth (typically all that is left of them) are scattered everywhere along the beaches. Indeed, they are abundant enough that paleontologists Christy Visaggi and Stephen Godfrey recently cataloged of 26,000 of them to determine what kinds of sharks lived off the shores of ancient Maryland and in what numbers. 

Their findings, printed in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, reveal that this habitat was home to a mix of both living and extinct shark genera. There were fossils from Hemipristis (snaggletooth sharks), Galeocerdo (tiger sharks), Carcharias (sand tiger sharks), Carcharhinus (a subset of requiem sharks), and Isurus (mako sharks) in addition to the famous superpredator Carcharocles megalodon, most of which came from the time interval between 19 and 14 million years ago. (Teeth from many other genera, such as those related to whale sharks and great white sharks, were also found, but were so rare that they did not constitute a significantly significant sample.) While not exactly the same as their living relatives, these Miocene sharks would have looked very familiar to us, and clearly the area that would become the Calvert Cliffs was a very productive marine ecosystem which could support such a wide array of predators.  Not surprisingly, there was plenty of prey in the water, too. Although not explicitly considered in their study, Visaggi and Godfrey noted that fish, sea turtles, crocodiles, birds, seals, sea cows, and numerous whale species all lived in the same place, and every now and then a specimen of one of these animals is found showing evidence of shark attack.

&lt;p&gt;Here's the situation - science has been very good to me lately, and my salary is currently being supported by a couple of active grants. Before these grants were funded, I was supported by an individual source from a single department that was exempt from &lt;a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/article/20100318/NEWS/100318021/DHS+announces+employee+furloughs"&gt;furlough&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, I have 10% salary support from a source that is subject to the furlough.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that I have to furlough 2.7 hours by the end of the fiscal year.  Today, I had the following email exchange with one of the university administrators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Isis - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a reminder that you have 2.7 hours of Furlough to use ASAP.  You should receive the green Furlough Time Reports.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is for your 10% position.  You can only take 0.7hrs (40 mins) in a week.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call me should you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Administrator - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait.  Are you saying that I can only fulough 40 minutes in any given week in order to get to my 2.7 hours?  I can't furlough all 2.7 at once?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Isis - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Crazy I know, but it's because there is a maximum percent of total furlough time that is allowed in one week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Dr. Isis is feeling like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="redtape.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/redtape.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="320" width="266"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CuucyFreZoo/R7kWfWzMChI/AAAAAAAAAZs/AYmzpBjs9ME/s400/redtape.jpg"&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/a&gt; An artist's rendition of Dr. Isis, tangled in red tape.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Free-Ride had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/08/keep_holy_the_furlough_day.php"&gt;a great post&lt;/a&gt; several months ago about the ethics of furlough in which she wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If the State of California cannot pay for a full academic year of teaching, research, and service activities from us, the State of California will not receive a full academic year of teaching, research, and service activities from us. This is what sharing the pain is about.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I agree completely with Dr. Free-Ride.  And, I realize I shouldn&amp;#39;t be bitching about this because there are some people with 100% furloughable time, but I have no idea exactly how one furloughs 40 minutes a week.  In fact, these 40 minutes feel like a scam.  If I could furlough my time in a chunk, I&amp;#39;d just take half a day off and head to the spa.  Or, I&amp;#39;d pick Little Isis up and go to the park for the afternoon.  But, what&amp;#39;s the likelihood that I am seriously going to furlough 40 minutes per week?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="zero_0.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/zero_0.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="482" width="392"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/zero.0.jpg"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;: About this much...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond that, the administrative effort required to administer this inane policy is simply mind boggling.  How did some bureaucratic asshat not forsee this exact situation and write into the policy &amp;quot;if you have less that XXX hours of furlough remaining, you can take them in a single week&amp;quot;?  Instead, I have to print out that ridiculous green sheet EVERY WEEK, mark &amp;quot;0.67 hours&amp;quot; as my furlough time, find my chair to sign it, and walk my happy ass over to HR to turn it in to the furlough lady.  That takes as much damned time as the amount of time I&amp;#39;m furloughing AND I have to do it many times instead of just furloughing all 2.7 hours at once and going through this process once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has left the domestic and laboratory goddess in a ripe foul mood for the afternoon.  I apologize to Mr. Isis, who I am putting an IV in tonight in the name of science.  I will try to be gentle, but I am cheesed off enough that I can&amp;#39;t guarantee anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jerks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/how_dr_isis_got_tied_up_in_red.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/XYx4tT4tWuw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268946127967"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/mikes_father_died_this_is_his.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cb7da96e3aa1c557</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Mike's Father Died.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian texts right to dump Darwin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by Paul Bynum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how the evolutionists react when their  messiah, Charles Darwin, is ignored or otherwise abused. The very fact that he is not given top billing in Christian-based biology  textbooks for the home-schooling market sends them in an absolute thither [sic]. In an Associated Press story (“Top home-school  texts dismiss Darwin,” Herald, March 7), Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary professor at the University of Chicago, went so  far as to say, “I feel strongly about this. These books are promulgating lies to kids.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lies? I believe that opinion may depend on which side of the creation  coin you come down on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the humanistic, God-denying, evolutionary side, you can tell children  they are nothing more than animals that appeared by mere chance through a prolonged process that began in a  great big explosion that over millions and millions of years now allows them to wonder and care how they got here and what  it might matter in the eons to come. If they are just animals, why not act the part? Why not blow away the other animal  that stole your peanut butter sandwich at lunch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the creation side of the coin, children are told they are created in  the image of a loving God that cares for each and every one of them. Their Christian home-schooling parents do,  indeed, want to give their children religious and moral instruction that teaches them they are more than just another  animal in the evolutionary food chain. In order to give this type of education to their children, textbooks are needed that  are from a godly, biblical-based point of view. Not a Charles Darwin, God-denying view point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why should the evolutionists blow a gasket when textbooks are  released giving a different point of view? They want God totally out of any educational process and bring Christian home  schooling under the state-controlled school system, thereby eliminating free choice of your child’s future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Bynum, Durango&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This letter encapsulates one of the faithful’s commonest objections to evolution: it does away with God-given morality, thereby giving us license to act like beasts.  Accommodationists would have us believe that if Mr. Bynum and his ilk were politely informed that many religious people have no problem accepting evolution, they’d suddenly abjure their views and embrace Darwinism.  The morality argument would vanish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you believe &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, then I have a a Ray Comfort edition of &lt;em&gt;The Origin&lt;/em&gt; to sell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Bynum and his Durago buddy Gary Anderson were involved in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/01/flame_war_in_the_durango_heral.php"&gt;a bit of P. Z. Myers-bashing &lt;/a&gt;four years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, when asked about HCR without a public option (there is no public option in the current legislation), a plurality felt that their own quality of practice and career satisfaction would be unchanged; many thought that their income would drop; many thought medical care would decline, and many thought that physician supply would decline.  Many physicians can form reasonable opinions about most of those measures---but not physician supply.  Nothing I do in my daily practice give me data on physician supply. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Georgia,&amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Bitstream Charter&amp;#39;,Times,serif;line-height:19px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When asked, &amp;quot;How do you think the passage of health reform WITHOUT a public option would affect your professional/practice plans, if at all?&amp;quot; 70% of respondents said, &amp;quot;no change.&amp;quot;  It is not reported in this data, but apparently primary care physicians, who made up about a third of respondents, were more likely to say that they would leave medical practice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Georgia,&amp;#39;Times New Roman&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Bitstream Charter&amp;#39;,Times,serif;line-height:19px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have no doubt that there are unsatisfied physicians out there.  This data, gathered unscientifically, hyped by the survey company, and widely picked up by partisan media, is not a reliable measure of doctors&amp;#39; responses to health care reform.
Thinking about it from a purely practical standpoint, how many primary care physicians can financially afford to retire?  How many can simply pick up and change careers?

Nevertheless, the developing brain accomplishes this feat with remarkable specificity – neurons from each area of the brain send out axons which follow a stereotyped pathway to find their appropriate targets, guided by signpost proteins along the way.  Once in the right general area they have to select specific cell types with which to form a synapse, often limited to a certain layer or sub-region.  Many cells will even form synapses specifically with distinct subcellular compartments of their target cells – on distal or proximal parts of the dendrites or directly on to the cell body, for example.  Specifying this level of connectivity, with the numerical complexity of the mammalian brain, obviously requires a large number of labels that can be used to match synaptic partners (even allowing for some level of combinatorial logic that increases the coding capacity).  One class of molecules that has emerged recently as important in this process are members of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily.  These are secreted or transmembrane proteins which are characterised by a domain called the leucine-rich repeat in their extracellular region.  LRR domain proteins are well known in the immune system, where they recognize a diversity of pathogenic factors.  In the nervous system, these proteins are also involved in recognizing a diversity of factors, but in this case, the factors are protein labels on the surface of other neurons.  A role for these proteins in the process of neuronal target selection first came to light in studies in fruitflies, where different LRR proteins act as labels to match specific motor neurons with their appropriate target muscles.  In parallel, studies in mammals have identified a number of subfamilies of LRR proteins which are capable of inducing one neuron to form a synapse with another one in a cellular assay in culture.  A couple of recent studies have highlighted the important roles of one such subfamily, called the LRRTM proteins in this process.   These studies found that LRRTM2 can induce the formation of a synapse and that it accomplishes this by binding to the protein Neurexin-1 on the opposing cell.      Neurexins were already known to be involved in this kind of process, through binding to a different family of proteins, the Neuroligins.  What makes these studies particularly interesting is not just the identification of the additional role of LRRTM proteins in thise process, but that Neurexins, Neuroligins and the LRRTM genes have all previously been implicated in autism and/or schizophrenia (and in the case of LRRTM1 in the genetics of left-handedness).  Failing to form the right kinds of connections, especially the correct balance of excitatory and inhibitory connections, can, it seems, lead to the kind of dysfunction of neural circuits and networks that ultimately results in psychopathology. The complement of LRR proteins has expanded dramatically over mammalian evolution, and individual members have diverged rapidly in protein sequence (see Dolan et al., below).  These findings, in the light of the functions of various members of this superfamily, suggest that LRR proteins collectively contribute to the complexity of connectivity of the mammalian brain and may have been important in its evolution.

&lt;p&gt;St. Urho (pronounced “oorho”) is a &lt;a href="http://www.sainturho.com/origin.htm"&gt;completely made-up saint&lt;/a&gt;.   Essentially, Finnish Minnesotans were sick of green beer and Irish   hoopla in March, and decided they needed their own holiday on &lt;strong&gt;March   16th&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The legend says St. Urho chased the grasshoppers   out of ancient Finland, thus saving the grape crop and the jobs of   Finnish vineyard workers. He did this by uttering the phrase: &lt;/em&gt;“Heinäsirkka,   heinäsirkka, mene täältä hiiteen” &lt;em&gt;(roughly translated:   “Grasshopper, grasshopper, go to Hell!”). His feast is celebrated by   wearing the colors Royal Purple and Nile Green. St. Urho is nearly   always represented with grapes and grasshoppers as part of the   picture…..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you can now see my interest in this holiday: you get to drink lots of wine and cuss at insects. It’s a holiday made of win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So…If you were going to invent a patron saint for yourself or a favorite activity, who and what would it be? And what would your celebration be like?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

It’s a good story — it was fictionalized in the very cute movie &amp;quot;The Dish&amp;quot; — and he interviews a couple of the men who were there during the whole thing. And if you listen to the whole thing, they mention a familiar name, too…&lt;/p&gt;

href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/18/we-all-end-up-in-the-same-place/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Hayward&lt;/strong&gt; draws the truth: Ultimately, we all just &lt;a href="http://www.nakedpastor.com/archives/4874"&gt;end up in the same place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nakedpastor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/dead.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.nakedpastor.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/dead.jpg" title="Dead" width="550" height="344"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different is that atheists are honest about what happens when we all die.  We don’t make up stories about the afterlife. We don’t claim to have knowledge about something no one has ever experienced.  We accept that death is the end of the line and hopefully we’ve left behind wonderful memories and a positive legacy for those around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side note #1&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the commenters on David’s site alludes to this, but does it make sense for an atheist to have “Rest In Peace” written on the tombstone?  There’s obviously no need to worry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side note #2&lt;/strong&gt;: Tombstone?  What a waste of space. Atheists ought to be giving their bodies to science or being cremated.  (Sure, they’re not around to make that decision, but they can let others know of their wishes beforehand.)  Are others with me on this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side note #3&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re all organ donors, right?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(2009) is a qualitative study on people with non-specific chronic low back pain and examines their exercise adherence.  It examines their experiences of exercise past and present and also how they felt during the research study programme.  Many of the findings are in line with expectations from people who have been unsuccessful at establishing long term exercise behaviour, low exercise self efficacy and feelings of fear and helplessness.  The participants also reported that they felt that they lacked sufficient expertise on gym equipment and all expressed a desire for better instruction and feedback of all exercises.  Its a good qualitative paper with exerts from focus group transcripts which really help to understand how some people with injuries and chronic conditions feel about exercise and physical activity.  The full paper can be found here.Another qualitative paper from a broadly similar population is  Hendry et al (2006) and examines the experience of people with Osteoarthiritis of the knee.  The themes of the focus groups are broadly similar and its good to read the two studies to compare the experiences of the two groups.  The Hendry study can be found here.Slade SC, Molloy E, &amp;amp; Keating JL (2009).

&lt;p&gt;Prominent historical figures are inevitable targets for rumor and intrigue, especially surrounding their personal lives.  It might be easy of those of us living today to think that tabloids and gossip rags are modern inventions, but this is simply not so.  People have always been obsessed with the affairs of the privileged classes, enjoying with special relish a good story of tragedy and downfall; the more debauched, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we will examine the lives and legacies of two such figures, Elizabeth I of England and Catherine the Great of Russia.  Why was Elizabeth able to transcend the malicious gossip of her day, while sordid tales about Catherine still circulate today?  Perhaps the stories that persevere are true, while fabrications fall away as the years go on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, we take a look at these various stories and legends and attempt to determine truth from rumor in the alleged happenings (or non happenings) in the bedrooms of queens.&lt;/p&gt;

This one has more than 120 sessions, with presentations on topics ranging from "Pareto-Optimal Solutions of Nash Bargaining Resource Allocation Games with Spectral Mask and Total Power Constraints" to "Matching Canvas Weave Patterns from Processing X-Ray Images of Master Paintings".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large number of parallel sessions make it impossible for any one person to attend more than a tiny fraction of the interesting papers, but luckily, ICASSP is one of the (many) conferences that now require would-be presenters to submit a paper (in this case, 4 pages),  not just a short abstract.  All accepted papers are then published on a CD given to attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This practice is an enormous step up, in all respects, from the old-fashioned idea of submitting an abstract of a couple of hundred words.  It makes it possible for the program committee to referee submissions on a rational basis.  What is even more important, it means that the conference proceedings become a crucial mode of technical communication. In many subfields,  such conference papers (typically made available for free in reprint archives or on authors' home pages) now play a more important role than journal publication does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I wish that the &lt;a href="http://www.lsadc.org"&gt;LSA&lt;/a&gt; would totter into the 1980s and join this trend…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll illustrate the value of such conference papers with one example that I stumbled across yesterday.  If I have time, I'll blog about some others later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific ICASSP paper that I'm talking about is Athanasios Tsanas et al., "&lt;a href="http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/samp/members/max/publications/tsanas_icassp2010.pdf"&gt;Enhanced Classical Dysphonia Measures and Sparse Regression for Telemonitoring of Parkinson's Disease Progression&lt;/a&gt;". Their abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Dysphonia measures are signal processing algorithms that offer an objective method for characterizing voice disorders from recorded speech signals. In this paper, we study disordered voices of people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we demonstrate that a simple logarithmic transformation of these dysphonia measures can significantly enhance their potential for identifying subtle changes in PD symptoms. The superiority of the log-transformed measures is reflected in feature selection results using Bayesian Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) linear regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this enhancement in the emerging application of automated characterization of PD symptom progression from voice signals, rated on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the gold standard clinical metric for PD. Using least squares regression, we show that UPDRS can be accurately predicted to within six points of the clinicians’ observations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That  "within six points" should be interpreted with respect to the overall range of the metric (which is 0-176 for the total UPDRS, and 0-108 for the motor portion of the scale), and also with respect to the distribution of values among the 42 subjects in this study. This last distribution is not clearly specified in the paper, but we do learn that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The 42 subjects (28 males) had an age range (mean ± std) 64.4 ± 9.24 years, average motor-UPDRS 20.84 ± 8.82 points and average total UPDRS 28.44 ± 11.52 points.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dysphonia measures used were based on subjects' attempts to produce extended steady-state vowel sounds, and included various variations on standard phonetic measurements of jitter (local perturbation in pitch), shimmer (local perturbations of amplitude) , and harmonics-to-noise ratio (breathiness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this table suggests, the core result was simply that these dysphonia measures predicted the clinician's numerical judgments within about seven to nine points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TsanasTable2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper's technical innovations (log transform of the jitter and shimmer measures, and subsequent feature selection) improved this baseline performance by about 7%.  (Let me note in passing that the authors use ten-fold cross-validation and other appropriate techniques in making these estimates. This is worth noting, since researchers in disciplines like psychology and sociology sometimes report regression residuals or similar results without doing this, thus in effect testing on their training material and offering an inflated idea of the quality of their predictions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know enough about the distribution of UPDRS values in the subject pool, or the typical repeatability of clinicians&amp;#39; UPDRS assignments to individual patients,  to evaluate this description of the residuals.  And I don&amp;#39;t know enough about the clinical management of Parkinson&amp;#39;s patients to evaluate how useful this level of prediction would be as a monitoring tool, by itself or in combination with other inputs.  But to my eye — that of someone who understands the speech science and the basic statistical issues reasonably well, and has a superficial understanding of the medical issues — this looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally, I'm convinced that it's possible to quantify many speech- and language-based diagnostic indicators,with sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability that compare favorably with many of the physiological tests in common use today.  And these linguistic tests are totally non-invasive, require no apparatus other than a microphone and a computer, and in many cases can be administered remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering the possible benefits, there's remarkably little research of this kind, overall, and so I was happy to find a specific example of such high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that I could get this far in learning about this conference presentation because  it exists as a coherent document, published in the conference  proceedings and also on the authors' web site.  If ICASSP were run like  the LSA meeting, with a 200-word abstract being the only concrete record  of a presentation, I wouldn't be writing this. And even if the live presentation (in this case a poster) had caught my eye, I might never have remembered to follow up on it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 3/21/2010: — In reference to this post, Athanasios Tsanas writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Your concerns there are right: the distribution of the motor-UPDRS and total-UPDRS scores are not mentioned (roughly these are Gaussian shape like, with a peak almost in the middle of the range of values). Clinically, I got the impression that medics are satisfied with UPDRS estimates within about 5 points of their evaluations - which is the inter-rater variability, i.e. the UPDRS difference that might occur in the evaluation of patients between two trained clinicians. In fact, my latest results suggest we can do considerably better than that, further endorsing the argument of using speech signals to track average Parkinson's disease symptom severity. These new results are derived by using some novel nonlinear speech signal processing algorithms which complement the already established measures, and we are submitting a paper describing all that soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now I do, and I’m very glad I went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/nsrc2010/nsrc20103rd.shtml"&gt;the Next-Generation Suborbital Researchers Conference 2010&lt;/a&gt; (NSRC2010), and its goal was to figure out how best to exploit an upcoming revolution in space travel: private companies making suborbital launches to the very edge of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space, in this case, is defined as being 100 km (62 miles) above the Earth’s surface. There, the atmosphere is incredibly thin, which has obvious benefits for astronomical observations (less turbulence blurring images, darker skies to see faint objects, less air to absorb ultraviolet and infrared light). But perhaps just as importantly, the planned flights will have up to three full minutes of microgravity — what is popularly but inaccurately called weightlessness or &amp;quot;zero g&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where my initial skepticism came in. What can you do with only a few minutes of free fall? Well, it turns out you can do a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. There are a host of biological, engineering, and astronomical experiments that can be run in this environment, ones that would be far too prohibitively expensive to do on, for example, a Shuttle mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/virgingalactic_ss2.jpg" alt="virgingalactic_ss2" title="virgingalactic_ss2" width="610" height="388"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this next generation of rockets from &lt;a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/"&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt; (Richard Branson’s effort with Space Ship 2, a model of which is pictured above), &lt;a href="http://www.blueorigin.com/"&gt;Blue Origin&lt;/a&gt; (Jeff Bezos from Amazon.com), and others will reach a height making a lot of this science possible. The region up to 100 km is too high to reach by balloon, and too low for orbital rockets, which is why it’s been dubbed &amp;quot;the ignorosphere&amp;quot;. But it has its uses…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations of the Sun, for example, may not need much time to do because (you may have noticed) the Sun is pretty bright, so a three or four minute flight is enough to get some good data. The way incoming energy from the Sun couples with the Earth’s atmosphere is not hugely well understood, and a lot of it happens in this region high above the planet’s surface. Effects of low gravity on the human body can be tested, as well as on plants and other biological systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, enough science can be done on these trips that the conference itself brought in &lt;em&gt;250 people&lt;/em&gt; interested in the topic. I was surprised at how many people came, as were the conference planners themselves: they were expecting half that many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a lot of confidence here. Lori Garver, NASA Deputy Administrator, gave a keynote talk, saying that NASA will pledge $15 million per year to this new field of research in the new budget (pending approval by Congress). Alan Stern, an astronomer and conference organizer, announced that &lt;a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/"&gt;Southwest Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, for whom he works, will put up &lt;em&gt;$1 million&lt;/em&gt; of its own money for researchers to fly into space, too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that each flight will cost something like $200,000, this is a pretty decent pool of money to investigate the ignorosphere. That may sound like a lot, but in fact a lot of scientific grants are in this range; a few years back I had my own personal research grant on Hubble that was for more than $40,000, and while I was at Sonoma State University our small team routinely applied for educational grants for $50k and more. Getting $200k for a flight is well within the reach of a lot of researchers. Of course, they’ll need more to cover equipment and such, but compare that to the millions upon millions needed for an orbital flight, or even several million for a sounding rocket, and you start to see that this is a pretty good deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA itself can use this sort of thing as well, testing equipment and new technology to see how it behaves. This is a whole lot cheaper than putting something up on the Space Shuttle (or on the next generation of orbital rockets). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was exciting to sit and listen to all the buzz about this new, intermediate frontier. But as interesting as the science was, there was something more important going on at this conference. Something that, I suspect very strongly, will change the way we look at space travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that will be the topic of my next post on this. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

and &lt;a href="http://abhh547.portfolios.cutlines.org/2010/03/welcome-to-my-new-blog/" title=""&gt;say Hello&lt;/a&gt;. Gozde is a science journalism student with Connie St.Louis (the same class as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_16.php" title=""&gt;Christine Ottery&lt;/a&gt; who many of you met at ScienceOnline2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gozde is interested in many aspects of science communication and journalism and more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, I'll be catapulting into the big world wide web my exploration of the social, cultural and political implications of research in science, medicine and the environment. Also, I'll be blogging about issues to do with science in the media, science education and policy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her first post - &lt;a href="http://abhh547.portfolios.cutlines.org/2010/03/science-journalism-and-the-public-understanding-of-how-science-works-a-suggested-remedy/" title=""&gt;Journalism and the public understanding of how science works. A suggested remedy.&lt;/a&gt;, which nominally is a response &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/03/17/the-science-reader-a-crowd-sourced-profile/" title=""&gt;to this post of mine&lt;/a&gt;, but really addresses more deeply the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article by Toby Murcott that calls for opening peer reviewers' comments to journalists, Gozde begins a series of serious, thoughtful essays on the topic. Go and read it, post comments, respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sunday, January 17 at 9-10:05am 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Science online talks between generations&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/blugger" title=""&gt;Beatrice Lugger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/PM_09_Nobel_Laureate_Meeting_2009__Follow_the_Proceedings_Online.AxCMS" title=""&gt;Christian Rapp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: In huge meetings around the world several organizations try to initiate a dialogue between top scientists and young researchers -the &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de"&gt;Lindau Meetings of Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; are one of them providing numerous opportunities for an exchange of ideas and thoughts between young researchers and Nobel Laureates. The idea is to support this dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. We'd like to discuss how one can initiate a continued communication process even between two meetings. Which internet/social web tools might be useful to bridge the communication habits of a younger generation with that of an older generation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is if one can organize such a dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get some impressions of the Lindau Nobel Laureates meeting itself please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/WebHome.AxCMS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, click through the archives, read in the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/MeetingReports.AxCMS"&gt;annual reports&lt;/a&gt; and take a look at the actual list of &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de/PublicParticipants.AxCMS?Meeting=278&amp;amp;Usergroup=6742"&gt;Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; who are expected to join the next meeting (the participation list of young researchers will be online by the end of April 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to promote the scientific communication between generations. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/video/lindau2009/index.html"&gt;Five short films&lt;/a&gt; presented by Nature Video, show some kinds of such a dialogue. Join Laureates and young researchers as they discuss the future of medicine, consider the ethics of nanotechnologies, plan new collaborations, and seek ways to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely there also exists a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/2009/06/exemplifying-apprenticeship-the-lindau-meetings.php"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting and we are acitve on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/LindauNobelLaureatesMeeting"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lindaunobel"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Till now the traffic on these plattforms abruptly drops down after the meetings and grows up some weeks before the next one. We'd like to find new ways to encourage a continuous dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_talks_betwee_3.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/_58PioqQIb4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268921767769"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Neurodojo/~3/LoHRK3NXNMQ/are-big-brains-better-for-long-trips.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0674a4cc314c040</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Are big brains better for long trips?</title><published>2010-03-18T08:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T08:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/pwQsPL_4jC0/are-big-brains-better-for-long-trips.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Neurodojo/~3/LoHRK3NXNMQ/are-big-brains-better-for-long-trips.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">For many birds, migration is a major component of life. You&amp;#39;d expect think that migration would have a whole cascade of effects on those birds, including the nervous system. But which way? 

On the one hand, migration might be correlated with large brains to handle the the complex navigation tasks. On the other hand, migration might be correlated with small brains that are energetically efficient.

Sol and colleagues compared over six hundred species of birds (measuring over 4,000 skulls). Species ranged from non-migratory, to some members of a population where migratory, to some that were extensively migratory. They found, as had previous authors, that migratory birds tended to have smaller brains than non-migratory birds. Unsurprisingly, there is a substantial amount of variation from species to species. For instance, corvids (e.g., crows and allies) don&amp;#39;t show this effect.

But what these authors are really trying to figure out is not the correlation, but the direction of causation. Do lineages become migratory because their small brains allow it, or does migration cause brains to become smaller, as neurons as jettisoned over evolutionary time for efficiency?

And here, there&amp;#39;s a lot of math. It&amp;#39;s not easy going for someone who doesn&amp;#39;t do these kinds of models routinely, and I don&amp;#39;t. Sol and colleagues argue that the models they tested indicate that migration causes brain size to reduce, rather than the other way around. Again, however, a good chunk of variation appears to be due to factors that were not included in the model. They also suggest that some brain areas may be more subject to selection pressures, and it&amp;#39;s more complex than just the overall brain size alone.

When people think about the evolution of brains, the most common thing that leaps to mind is brains getting larger. Maybe that&amp;#39;s just because that&amp;#39;s such a major aspect of human evolution. This work is a nice example of selection pressure working to reduce brain size.

It's &lt;a href="http://blogs.radionational.net.au/atheistconvention/?p=610"&gt;yet another review of the Global Atheist Convention&lt;/a&gt;, this time by a long-winded Anglican priest. I'm being rude in my evaluation despite the fact that it is actually a generous review, because he repeats another of those oblivious stereotypes that always pisses me off. I've highlighted my triggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know my atheist colleagues and friends think this way of recognising life is just a form of 'misfire', a delusion.  They find support for their view from the natural processes like a tsunami or a congenital disease, which appear to be indifferent to the value of life.  But these are some of the consequences of the processes that produce life.  In conversations with students this quickly leads them questioning my belief in God: 'why would God use natural processes, including evolution by natural selection, to bring life into existence?' and 'why would God use any process at all, why not just create the world in the intended end state, if the world is supposedly created for some purpose?'   Will our faith and theology be up to answering these questions? The answer has to be robust enough to address Dawkins saying the universe is, at bottom, pitilessly indifferent.  I regard these as excellent questions for which there are good answers.  But these would take more than this blog to set out.  It is one part of a larger conversation working out the rationality of faith.  &lt;b&gt;This reference to 'reason' is deeply Christian in a Christianity that has reason to believe the divine Logos has become flesh in Christ.&lt;/b&gt;    
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
At the end of her vivid, witty segment Catherine Deveney gave us this word: "Seek the truth and the truth will make you free. Don't be afraid of death. Be afraid of never having really lived.  Peace be with you."  These are also deeply Christian themes, at least one being a direct quote.   CD says 'God is bullshit' - that is her gig at the comedy festival.  Taking a line from Dan Barker, a speaker at the Convention, &lt;b&gt;this is culturally resonant with speaking about God as a shepherd in Jesus' own day.&lt;/b&gt; But could the truth, life and peace she commends to us enter into a conversation with the truth, life and peace that Christians value?  Catherine Deveney, would you be interested in another gig?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a phrase I heard all the time when I was living in Utah. If I did something friendly or helpful, the good Mormon would tell me that was mighty "white" of me. It's the same thing when someone appropriates truth and justice and reason as &lt;i&gt;Christian&lt;/i&gt; virtues, and sits around trying to be nice to atheists by telling them how close they come to a Christian ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they call us the arrogant ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not nice. I'm not Christian. And I tell Stephen Ames that no matter how charitable he thinks he is, he comes across as a condescending prat, and he can get stuffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those virtues are &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; values, they don't belong to Christianity, and I'm so tired of Christians acting as if they are. Hands off. Ames sat through the convention, noted that many of the speakers repeated frequently that you can be good without gods, and failed to notice that not once did they play his game of pretending that goodness is an atheist property. We don't delude ourselves that way. We also know that reason is a virtue grafted onto a religion that is primarily concerned with irrational faith, and is entirely evidence-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's his patronizing attitude that is a significant part of the moral conflict. By once again trying to tie morality to Christianity, he perpetuates the myth that marginalizes atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to mention the flip side of this problem. I enthusiastically grant that Christians can and do embrace what I consider human cultural values, and I do not consider religion to be a necessary obstacle to doing good. The best of Christianity dedicates itself to those wonderful principles of social justice that some read into the Jesus story (I&amp;#39;d add that this is the very same thing I find commendable in communism). Rarely have I encountered anyone who does not regard social justice, equality, and fairness as virtues…except in the pathological extremes of libertarianism and far right conservatism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out there are people — even influential people — who seem to be dangerous sociopaths from my perspective. &lt;a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/03/jesus_was_a_nazi_and_sos_your.html"&gt;Roger Ebert has a fascinating essay on Glenn Beck&lt;/a&gt;. Beck is, apparently, an amoral being who rejects the common interests of all humankind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the words "social justice" code for? Why, Nazism and Communism, says Beck: "Social justice was the rallying cry--economic justice and social justice--the rallying cry on both the communist front and the fascist front." Beck even went so far as to cite Jesus Christ, saying, and I quote: "Nowhere does Jesus say, &lt;i&gt;Hey, if somebody asks for your shirt, give your coat to the government and have the government give them a pair of slacks.&lt;/i&gt;" Well, Beck has me there. It is quite true that nowhere does Jesus say that. Nor, for that matter, does he ever say, &lt;i&gt;A wop bop a lu bop, a wop bam boom!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What I would enjoy hearing is one single clergyman from any faith in America, appearing on Beck's program to agree with him and denouncing social justice. Such a person might be a real piece of work. I suspect he might currently be in between congregations. Beck's oversight is that all religions teach social justice. That's sort of what they're about. "My church doesn't," said Beck, who is a Mormon. Not for the first time, he was dead wrong, and the mountains of Utah rang with the thunder of outraged Mormon elders. I know now, and did not know before, that before statehood the Mormons in the Utah territory provided universal health care and care for the poor as a matter of their duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to identify an issue on which atheists and liberal Christians can find common ground? There it is. Just don't try to pretend that only Good Christians are the proprietors of moral behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/even_the_nice_theologians_anno.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0hpqWekBpK0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268920635977"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/i_was_dumber_after_listening_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6fdd1e2542c6524d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">I was dumber after listening to that</title><published>2010-03-18T10:41:45Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T10:41:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/tDC0RfEyCTc/i_was_dumber_after_listening_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/i_was_dumber_after_listening_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can now listen to the recent &lt;a href="http://www.mq.edu.au/mqvideos/pell_barker.html"&gt;debate between Cardinal George Pell and Dan Barker&lt;/a&gt;. It will convince you that the Catholic church is totally lacking in any intellectual criterion for appointing cardinals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practically the first words out of Pell's mouth are &lt;span&gt;"God as creator and chance or the only two options as an explanation for the universe"&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;"For atheists the universe is a product of blind chance."&lt;/span&gt; We can just stop there: what about the hypothesis that the universe was spawned from super-dense farts of a trans-cosmic supranatural cockroach? But then he goes on to the argument from selected authority (Antony Flew, of course) and fine-tuning. Pell is not a physicist, he barely understands the concept, so it's rather silly for him, as a supernatural dogmatist, to rely on a physical argument. And of course we get the "cells are so complex!" argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barker was good, but he was like a bandage slapped on top of a penetrating head wound. Better to avoid the damage altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the position of clergy who don’t believe in God.  Yes, there are some of them, and they’re the subject of a new study by Daniel Dennett and Linda LaScola from Tufts University, “Preachers who are not believers.” You can find that &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith//2010/03/disbelief_in_the_pulpit/all.html"&gt;28-page study&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Washingon Post&lt;/em&gt;’s “On Faith” section (click the link on that page to download the pdf).  I recommend reading it if you have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennett and LaScola managed to find and interview five Protestant “nonbelievers.” Given the liberality of today’s clergy, and the resistance of many nonbelieving preachers to participate in the study, this may be only the tip of the iceberg.  Although some interviewees accept a numinous notion that might be termed “God,” none of them believe in the theistic God limned by the faith they profess.  Here’s the testimony of “Jack,” a Southern Baptist preacher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“OK, this God created me. It’s a perfect God that knows everything; can do anything. And somehow it got messed up, and it’s my fault. So he had to send his son to die for me to fix it. And he does. And now I’m supposed to beat myself to death the rest of my life over it. It makes no sense to me. Don’t you think a God could come up with a better plan than that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What kind of personality; what kind of being is this that had to create these other beings to worship and tell him how wonderful he is? That makes no sense, if this God is all-knowing and all-wise and all-wonderful. I can’t comprehend that that’s what kind of person God is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every church I’ve been in preached that the Jonah in the Whale story is literally true. And I’ve never believed that. You mean to tell me a human was in the belly of that whale? For three days? And then the whale spit him out on the shoreline? And, of course, their convenient logic is, ‘Well, God can do anything.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I think most Christians have to be in a state of denial to read the Bible and believe it. Because there are so many contradicting stories. You’re encouraged to be violent on one page, and you’re encouraged to give sacrificial love on another page. You’re encouraged to bash a baby’s head on one page, and there’s other pages that say, you know, give your brother your fair share of everything you have if they ask for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if God was going to reveal himself to us, don’t you think it would be in a way that we wouldn’t question? …I mean, if I was wanting to have…people teach about the Bible…I would probably make sure they knew I existed. …I mean, I wouldn’t send them mysterious notes, encrypted in a way that it took a linguist to figure out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but note that “Jack” was influenced by an classic argument for atheism:  if God wants us to know his presence, why is He always hidden?  Isn’t it more parsimonious to posit the absence of God rather than a God who, for reasons that elude us, is always just around the corner? Theologians, of course, have lots of arguments why the absence of God is precisely the evidence that God exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, two of the clergy lost their faith, in part, by reading new atheist books by Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens.  Even Bill Maher’s movie&lt;em&gt;, Religulous&lt;/em&gt;, influenced one of them. So much for the notion that new atheism makes no converts.  “Adam” speaks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell you, the book that just grabbed my mind and just twisted it around, was Christopher Hitchens’ &lt;em&gt;God is Not Great&lt;/em&gt;. It was shocking, some of that stuff – the throws and jabs against faith and stuff. I would think, ‘He’s crazy.’ But then I’d say, ‘No. Step back and read it for what it is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preachers’ testimony makes a sad but enlightening read.  The road to eroded faith is tortuous, but often involved exposure to Biblical scholarship at the seminary or graduate school.  Faced with the notion that the Bible is a human construct, and not the inerrant word of God, several of these preachers began to question everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do these preachers stay in the faith and on the job? Three reasons, mostly.  One is financial: what else could they do with their training if they left the ministry? Often they have neither equity (living in church-owned houses) nor pensions.  Another, and perhaps more important, reason is that an admission of unbelief  would shock and disappoint their friends and family.  This is a very powerful motive, for facing the truth would rip asunder your network of social and family support.  &lt;a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/books/seeing-and-believing"&gt;We’ve encountered this before&lt;/a&gt; in the admission of Karl Giberson,  still a professed believer, head of BioLogos, and someone who may be teetering on the edge of apostasy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a purely practical matter, I have compelling reasons to believe in  God. My parents are deeply committed Christians and would be devastated,  were I to reject my faith. My wife and children believe in God, and we  attend church together regularly. Most of my friends are believers. I  have a job I love at a Christian college that would be forced to dismiss  me if I were to reject the faith that underpins the mission of the  college. Abandoning belief in God would be disruptive, sending my life  completely off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, many of these preachers like their work, especially the part of the job that involves helping troubled people. Jack again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And that’s what people told me my best skills were – dealing with people. …I can be with somebody and genuinely have empathy with them, and concern and love and help them get through a difficult situation. And every time that I did it, those people thought that I was wonderful. And they would just bend over backwards to tell me ‘Thank you.’ That was one of my strengths. …Being with somebody when their husband died. And just holding their hand, or putting my arm around them. But I never said ‘Now, he’s in heaven. Aren’t you glad for him?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s absolutely no doubt that faith, and religious institutions, have provided important help for those in need or in trouble.  Some religions do this more than others.  Sikhs, for example, seem to have a well-developed system of intra-faith welfare.  Such help doesn’t, of course, prove the existence of God or support any of the fact claims of faith, nor does it offset all the harms that faith has wrought on humanity.  But isn’t it a shame that there aren’t secular communities where those with altruistic instincts can “minister” without hypocrisy or fear?&lt;/p&gt;

And, if it is a new species, where it should fit in the human family tree - a near-human relative, a dwarf &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;, or something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/yjs5mb6" rel="external "&gt;November issue of the Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/a&gt; was devoted to &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt;, with a number of papers on various aspects of its anatomy and environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argue et al. have performed the first cladistic study of LB1. Cladistics uses comparisons of characteristics of specimens to try and determine their evolutionary relationships. Their results showed that LB1 most likely split from the rest of the genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; either after &lt;em&gt;H. rudolfensis&lt;/em&gt; but before &lt;em&gt;H. habilis&lt;/em&gt;, or after &lt;em&gt;H. habilis&lt;/em&gt;. It therefore apparently evolved from an early &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; species, sometime between about 1.5 and 1.9 million years ago. They also tested whether LB1 could have shared a unique common ancestor with either &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, but both of these hypotheses were strongly rejected. Their full conclusion was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Argue et al. 2009 Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Based on rigorous cladistic analyses, we propose that &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; evolved in the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene. The first of our two equally parsimonious trees suggests that &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; branched after &lt;em&gt;H. rudolfensis&lt;/em&gt; (represented by KNM-ER 1470) but prior to the divergence of &lt;em&gt;H. habilis&lt;/em&gt; (represented by KNM-ER 1813 and OH 24). Alternatively, our results are equally supportive of &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; branching after the emergence of &lt;em&gt;H. habilis&lt;/em&gt;. Our results sustain &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; as a new species (Brown et al., 2004; Morwood et al., 2005) and favor the hypothesis that &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; descended from an early species of &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; (Falk et al., 2005; Argue et al., 2006; Larson et al., 2007; Tocheri et al., 2007). We find no evidence of close phylogenetic relations to &lt;em&gt;H. sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, and reject the idea that the Liang Bua remains represent a pathological modern human. Importantly, we also are unable to link &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; phylogenetically to &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, rejecting the hypothesis that the small enigmatic bones resulted from insular dwarfing of &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;. It is surely time we accepted the reality of &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; as a species and seek answers to the questions that this species poses, not least of which is: who were its ancestors?”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other papers reach similar conclusions:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From the abstract of the Jungers et al. paper “Descriptions of the lower limb skeleton of &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jungers et al. 2009 Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The lower limb skeleton exhibits a uniquely mosaic pattern, with many primitive-like morphologies; we have been unable to find this combination of ancient and derived (more human-like) features in either healthy or pathological modern humans, regardless of body size.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the abstract of the Larson et al. paper “Descriptions of the upper limb skeleton of &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Larson et al. 2009 Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The upper limb presents a unique mosaic of derived (human-like) and primitive morphologies, the combination of which is never found in either healthy or pathological modern humans.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another recent paper about the hobbit by &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122688405/abstract" rel="external "&gt;Jungers and Baab&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the statistical journal Significance, and did a number of statistical comparisons of LB1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multivariate analysis shows LB1’s brain shape has no resemblance to the shape of modern human microcephalics; it is most similar in shape to fossil skulls of early &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, especially to the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/d2700.html" rel="external "&gt;Dmanisi skull D2700&lt;/a&gt;. The lower jaw has no chin but is instead strengthened by internal bone, similar to australopithecines, and the anatomy of some of the teeth are “strikingly primitive”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall body proportions of the hobbit were quite different to that of any populations of modern human pygmies. The weight of the hobbit falls into the lower range of pygmies, but the hobbit’s height is well below that of modern pygmies, so the hobbit “was far stockier than any modern human”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arm and leg lengths are unlike those of modern humans. The humerus (arm bone) falls into the lower range for modern humans (just), but the leg bones are much shorter than any modern humans. The ratio of the arm and leg bones was also unlike that of any modern humans, but did resemble that of another famous fossil:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jungers and Baab 2009 Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This extremely high ratio (around 87%) is never found in modern humans; this index is closely matched, however, in the partial skeleton of “Lucy”, a famous fossil of &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt; from Ethiopia dated to more than 3 million years ago!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To drive home the message, look at the scatter plots comparing LB1 to human pygmy populations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/03/18/Jungers_Hobbit.png" alt="Jungers_Hobbit.png" width="502" height="626" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth mentioning that these conclusions are not based solely on the LB1 fossil. A second lower jaw very similar to the first one has been found, upper limb bones have been found from six different individuals, and lower limb bones have been found from up to nine individuals. If LB1 was pathological (a very big if), it seems her whole population was similarly afflicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the idea that the hobbit is a pathological modern human looks more and more improbable. The differences between the hobbit and modern humans just keep coming, and no conceivable pathology could cause a population to have so many differences which, just coincidentally, happen to closely resemble those of primitive &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; nearly two million years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers know what I'm talking about. The infiltration of various unscientific, pseudoscientific, and even anti-scientific "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) modalities into academic medicine seems increasingly to be endangering science-based medicine. Worse, this infiltration of quackery seems at least as bad, if not worse, in academic medicine, so much so that Dr. R.W. coined a most exquisite term for the increasing prevalence of pseudoscience in medical academia: &lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;Quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Whether it is the American Medical Student Association &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/11/the_future_of_american_medicine_woo_1.php"&gt;promoting quackery&lt;/a&gt;, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) funding studies of homeopathy, medical schools adopting pseudoscience wholesale in their medical curriculum, or hospitals using it to attract woo-friendly paying patients, there is ample reason to fear for the scientific basis of medicine. It's not just the U.S., either. All you have to do is to peruse David Colquhoun's &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net"&gt;DC's Improbable Science&lt;/a&gt; to know that this is a phenomenon that transcends national boundaries and has made its way into virtually every industrialized nation, particularly in the U.K. and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result, it would appear, is a generation of medical students with far too many students like Jonny Martell. Jonny Martell is a third year medical student at Kings College London, and he has apparently found sufficient time away from his studies to write paeans to woo like &lt;a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2010/03/12/jonny-martell-the-magic-of-alternative-medicine/"&gt;The magic of alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, he doesn't see the irony of his chosen title. Alternative medicine is magic, all right. For what is homeopathy, if not magic? What is the idea that a healer can manipulate some sort of "life force" that is undetectable by modern scientific instruments in order to heal people but magic? What are psychics but people who either lie about being able to do magic or have deluded themselves into thinking they can do it? Yet, Mr. Martell feels inadquate around psychics:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/another_example_of_why_i_fear_for_the_fu.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/another_example_of_why_i_fear_for_the_fu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/XbL7hL7QdWA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268916295372"><id gr:original-id="980 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd03f66eaf775f65</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Adam Afriyie" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1514"/><category term="Brian Cox" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1505"/><category term="Evan Harris" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1043"/><category term="humour" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/540"/><category term="Lord Drayson" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/822"/><category term="Monty Python" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1513"/><category term="Peter Mandelson" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/736"/><category term="science funding" scheme="http://layscience.net/taxonomy/term/1504"/><category term="Science" scheme="http://layscience.net/science"/><category term="Media" scheme="http://layscience.net/media"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://layscience.net/politics"/><title type="html">What have the Scientists ever done for us?</title><published>2010-03-18T12:15:45Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T12:15:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/980" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://layscience.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; Somewhere in the interior of PARLIAMENT.

His tactic was clear – rather than discussing the scientific evidence, he chose to launch a personal attack against those who have the audacity to disagree with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of behavior seems to becoming more common as the defenders of nonsense are being called out in public. Most recently &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3961"&gt;an exhaustive review of the evidence for homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; led the UK Science and Technology Committee to conclude that homeopathy should not work, it does not work, and all public support for homeopathy and homeopathy research should be halted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simple fact is that homeopathic remedies are not remedies at all. They are nothing but water, with (in most cases) any active ingredients diluted to such a degree that nothing but water remains. Further, clinical studies, when viewed in total and not cherry picked, show that homeopathy (not surprisingly) does not work. The underlying principles of homeopathy, such as like cures like, is nothing but magical superstition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not merely my personal opinion – this is the consensus opinion of the scientific community. This is the opinion of honest scientists and regulators who have taken the time to thoroughly review the science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But homeopaths like Benneth do not want to make this about the science, because in that arena they lose – they have already lost. So they desperately, pathetically, and sometime petulantly want to make this personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their goal appears to be this  – make it seem as if this is a contest not about scientific evidence but about personal integrity, then attack some identified critic of homeopathy as if taking them down means homeopathy works. Make criticism of homeopathy seem like a sinister conspiracy, or simply protecting professional turf. Make criticism of homeopathy into a culture war – and if at all possible invoke the specter of “big pharma,” attack medicine itself, and if you are truly desperate call your critics Nazis. Making up lies is apparently acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4G7z2LZ3Pw"&gt;John Benneth does all of this and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Benneth thinks he can just make stuff up as needed (not surprising from a homeopath). He claims I make money from treating patients (while also claiming I don’t see patients). He is unaware and likely does not care that I am a salaried academic – I do not directly derive income from treating patients, and my salary is much less than I would make as a private neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims that there is a well-funded anti-homeopathy movement. No, Mr. Benneth – the world does not revolve about you and your silly beliefs. There is a pro-science-based medicine movement – we care about high quality science in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also not (alas) well-funded. The New England Skeptical Society (which he mentions by name) has no corporate or government funding (no ties to Big Pharma), nor does science-based medicine, or the Institute for Science in Medicine. The NESS is funded entirely by individual donors and merchandising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenge Benneth to provide evidence for the sinister conspiracy he alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benneth further launches into a massive non-sequitur – claiming that mainstream medicine cannot cure anything, it only provides “poisons” – by which he means approved pharmaceuticals. He repeats the canard oft-cited by cranks that mainstream medicine is the third leading cause of death in the US. Harriet Hall did a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=136"&gt;nice takedown of this fallacy&lt;/a&gt; – in essence, it focuses only on risk and not on benefit. But scientific medicine is about risk vs benefit, and it is clear from the evidence that science-based medicine has benefit in excess of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will ignore the bulk of Benneth’s personal libel – suffice to say it is beneath contempt. He does make an attempt at an evidence-based argument, but he completely botches it. He argues that there are many studies showing an effect for homeopathic remedies on plants, animals, and cells in culture. This, he argues, rules out the placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is both wrong and misleading. First, Benneth mischaracterizes the scientific argument as – because homeopathy cannot work any study showing an effect is due either to the placebo effect, fraud, or incompetence. I would add bias and chance, but further this is an oversimplification of the scientific position – the conclusion that homeopathy does not work is based both on the lack of plausibility and the poor quality and overall negative nature of the empirical evidence. (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178"&gt;See here for a more thorough discussion&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benneth then makes a patently illogical argument – that because the placebo effect is ruled out (false premise) that the critics of homeopathy are wrong. But what about fraud (as with Jacques Benveniste’s lab), incompetence, bias, and chance? This is why we do not cherry pick, but look for a pattern of reproducibility – something which is lacking with homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us also look further at the placebo claim – this is one I frequently hear. This is a simplistic misconception about the placebo effect, that it is entirely a mind-over-matter result of expectation. In fact, as it is operationally defined in medical trials, placebo effects can include anything other than a physiological response to the treatment, including observer expectation. Someone has to be observing the plants, cells, or animals and their bias counts too. (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=24"&gt;See here for a more complete discussion&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, after reviewing the published studies, I do not accept the premise that the evidence supports the efficacy of homeopathy in treating plants. The literature shows mostly small and uncontrolled studies – no solid reproducible effects. Certainly nothing that would justify rewriting the physics textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Benneth shows how desperate and deluded the homeopathic community has become. Sure – his absurd, fabricated, and mean-spirited rant is an extreme example, but the basic approach and arguments he uses are common among those who defend homeopathy against legitimate scientific criticism. I encounter them myself frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as Benneth would like to make this personal as a diversion and misdirection, he has only succeeded in publicly embarrassing himself. The question of whether or not homeopathy works is determined by the evidence – any thorough review of which leads to the unavoidable conclusion that it does not. Homeopathy is nothing but pre-scientific magic. Its modern proponents can scream all they want “ignore that man behind the curtain” – but it’s too late, the curtain has been pulled wide.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268915129636"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=9659">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/599fa056a61e2fbb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Science/faith incompatibility at HuffPo</title><published>2010-03-18T12:25:22Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T12:25:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/sciencefaith-incompatibility-at-huffpo/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post’s new “Religion” section is a mixed bag.  It is full of their usual woo, but also has a fair dollop of articles on atheism.  Tuesday’s column by Eric Michael Johnson, a journalist and graduate student in history, asserts in its title that “&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-michael-johnson/the-unseen-and-unknowable_b_500299.html"&gt;The Unseen and Unknowable Has No Place in Science.&lt;/a&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson was raised as a Lutheran, but jettisoned his faith when he realized that, unlike science, it was fully prepared to accept things for which there was no evidence.  A snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith, as Gary Whittenberger &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-02-28/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; magazine, has multiple common uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Faith” may refer to a religion or worldview, as in “My  faith is Islam.” It may refer to an attitude of trust or confidence, as  in “I have faith in my physician.” Or it may refer to believing  propositions without evidence or out of proportion to the available  evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;It is this latter use of faith that is incompatible with science. His  Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the  International Society for Krishna Consciousness (which has 170 Hare  Krishna centers in Europe and North America alone), was up front that he  &lt;a href="http://www.prabhupada.org.uk/sp_expose/evolution.htm"&gt;denied the evidence for evolution&lt;/a&gt;. Why? He didn’t  argue that the methods employed may have biased the results and that he  would reserve judgment until the studies were replicated. He didn’t  dispute the sample size in a given study or suggest a separate  interpretation of the observable facts. He completely disregarded the  entire pursuit of such knowledge because it contradicted his faith in a  prime mover. His faith told him that he was correct, regardless of what  the facts might be. There is a word for that, when you prefer your own  private fantasy to the real world. I think Richard Dawkins used it as  part of the title to &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/firstChapter,101"&gt;one  of his more popular books&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, religion is incompatible with science. This doesn’t mean, of  course, that religious people are incapable of doing science. Far from  it. There are certain questions that don’t probe too deeply into the  foundations of a person’s faith and they have no problem employing their  reason to its fullest in those cases. But when reason starts to get  uncomfortably close (as it has for &lt;a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/aprilweb-only/117-43.0.html"&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-future-of-god-a-new-t_b_498397.html"&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.org/a/4097"&gt;Michael Behe&lt;/a&gt;)  well, that’s when the desperate appeal to fuzzy thinking becomes  apparent. Because the assumption of God is so obvious to them (and I’m  sure they feel it powerfully) the evidence suggesting that evolution  follows natural mechanisms and has no need of a supernatural  intelligence must therefore be wrong. They’ll bend over backwards trying  to rationalize irrationality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Erica was very friendly and inquisitive, and we had a nice conversation about the lack of scientific evidence supporting any energy healing modality. I thought it would be fun to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3734"&gt;post what we had discussed at SBM&lt;/a&gt;, and then wait to see what trickled down into the finished piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the&lt;a href="http://www.somdnews.com/stories/02192010/entetop161047_32247.shtml"&gt; final article&lt;/a&gt; appeared I was very disappointed. Not only was I not quoted, but there was no skeptical counter-point at all. The story read like an unquestioning endorsement of junk science, and I wondered if it was worth it to continue speaking to journalists to offer expert advice. It seemed to me that this experience was emblematic of all that’s wrong with health reporting these days. (Just ask &lt;a href="http://www.healthnewsreview.org/blog/2009/12/"&gt;Gary Schwitzer&lt;/a&gt; – who has recently given up on reviewing TV health stories in mainstream media since they are generally so inaccurate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to apologize to Erica, because part of the problem in this case was her editors.  The &lt;a href="http://www.somdnews.com/stories/02192010/entetop161047_32247.shtml"&gt;online version&lt;/a&gt; of her story was substantially different from her printed version – and in this case the printed version was much more balanced. About 1/3 of an entire newspaper page (&lt;em&gt;The Enterprise&lt;/em&gt;, Friday, February 19, 2010, St. Mary’s County, Maryland) was devoted to my counter arguments. Here’s a short excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;“I’m honestly not aware of any scientific evidence that supports anything beyond the placebo effect with the energy healing modalities, including Reiki,” Jones said. “There is nothing we can measure that suggests there is a special force that needs to be balanced…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Success stories are anecdotal and can generally be accounted for by a person getting better from something like an infection on his own. Patients tend to report success from energy work more often for subjective ailments, especially pain and emotional problems, she said…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Jones opposes untested therapies’ inclusion in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;“I think it’s misleading to the patients because they’re going to a hospital, they’re trusting the hospital will offer them treatments that have proof that they work and they don’t realize that these nurses are offering nonscientific therapies,” Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;“I would rather that the nurses be given time to sit and talk to patients, go into the room and say, ‘Mrs. Smith, I’m sure you feel completely stressed out right now, and I don’t blame you.’ That would be more effective than concocting this pseudoscientific excuse for having nurses lay hands on people when really the patient needs a listening ear and a compassionate soul to talk to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think this case still serves as a reminder that traditional media’s approach to health story coverage can be flawed. Specifically, my concerns are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. “Balance” – While I recognize the importance of impartiality in news reporting, the quest for balance can go too far. Some facts are incontrovertible, so regularly insisting that the truth is “somewhere in between” can be both misleading and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Editing – Reporters can write an excellent piece of journalism that becomes nearly unrecognizable after their editors are finished with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Inability to crowd source – The advantage of blogs is that readers can correct the original article or add their valuable views. Without a community of virtual editors/contributors, any one news article is limited by the point of view and skills of the journalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Sensationalism – Mainstream media outlets are slaves to ratings and traffic. This means that they are under constant pressure to exaggerate the truth or misrepresent scientific research. Attention-grabbing headlines sell papers, and “&lt;a href="http://getbetterhealth.com/being-right-versus-being-influential/2009.05.19"&gt;good science makes bad television&lt;/a&gt;.” So readers must take what they read with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Author credentials – Sadly, highly trained science journalists are being laid off in record numbers due to the economic realities of the failing newspaper business. Remaining writers often do not have the depth of experience to handle complicated health topics and do not represent important scientific nuances correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I’d like to thank Erica for the opportunity to weigh in on energy healing and apologize for any distress that my blog post (expressing my frustration with the apparent bias revealed in the final online article) may have caused her. I know that Erica received a pointed letter of complaint regarding the story because of my post. I think it’s a good thing that people care enough about bias and misinformation to send formal complaints… because when those cease, we’ll be in serious trouble!&lt;/p&gt;

The whole tragedy shed light on the &lt;a href="http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=12156794"&gt;exemptions given to religious parents&lt;/a&gt; under Wisconsin law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it now stands, her parents have to spend &lt;a href="http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=12155229"&gt;a month in jail&lt;/a&gt; every year for six years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Under current Wisconsin law, parents can’t be found guilty of child abuse if they choose spiritual treatment rather than medicine or surgery.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that could finally change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
State lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow prosecutors to charge parents who refuse medical help for their children on religious grounds with child abuse.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rep. &lt;strong&gt;Terese Berceau&lt;/strong&gt; (D-Madison) &lt;a href="http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll/Session%20Related/bills09/11202/11203?f=templates$fn=document-frameset.htm$q=%5Bfield%20folio-destination-name:&amp;#39;ab590&amp;#39;%5D$x=Advanced#0-0-0-241855"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that “would eliminate a provision in state law allowing parents to withhold medical treatment if they believe that prayer is sufficient to heal their children.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="http://committeeschedule.legis.state.wi.us/files/HearingNotices/10-03-17-0100-2009ACHI-13549.html"&gt;an informational hearing on the bill took place&lt;/a&gt; in the Committee on Children and Families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may have taken a tragedy to get lawmakers to act, but at least something positive can now come from all this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Berceau] tells the Assembly Children and Families Committee children shouldn’t have to die for their parents’ beliefs. Joe Farkas, legislative liaison for Christian Science churches in Wisconsin, counters the bill is vague and raises questions about whether parents can teach their children religious values.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is questioning a parent’s right to teach religion.  This is about that religion causing parents to physically harm their children and then getting off the hook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href="http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt_and_politics/blog/article_0f076048-3080-11df-b3c1-001cc4c002e0.html"&gt;another bill&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by State Senator &lt;strong&gt;Lena Taylor&lt;/strong&gt; (D-Milwaukee) also going through the Wisconsin senate that’s similar to this one, except for a notable difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While Taylor’s bill would remove the religious exemption from child abuse and neglect laws, &lt;strong&gt;it adds the exemption to the medical practices section of the criminal code&lt;/strong&gt;, a more expansive section of the criminal code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State prosecutors, health care professionals and child care advocates, among others, fear &lt;strong&gt;this new exemption would further harm children by extending the religious exemption to an even broader category of crimes&lt;/strong&gt;, including homicide, abuse, recklessly endangering the safety of a child and criminal neglect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping it’s Berceau’s bill that goes into effect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, though, it’s very clear that the religious exemptions for child abuse and neglect need to end.  Wisconsin lawmakers should not hesitate in voting for Berceau’s bill.&lt;/p&gt;

But this has been sitting in my folder of blog topics forever and if I don’t get it out now, I probably never will. The topic, to be more specific, has to do with a characteristic of the book that you don’t hear talked about very often: the font size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the few of you who have been on board the International Space Station and haven’t yet heard the news, the 150th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; came along last year and some Young Earthers saw a chance to leverage this into propaganda. Since the copyright is long expired, the text is in the public domain, and any Joe Blow is free to publish it. This particular Joe Blow came in the person of evangelist Ray Comfort, who vomited a “Special Introduction” intended to discredit evolutionary biology into the front of &lt;em&gt;Origin.&lt;/em&gt; He then published it inside a cover giving every indication that it was a legitimate copy of the seminal work. Regardless of whether he admits it or not, the whole charade was a deliberate attempt to trick students into reading Ray’s own mental diarrhea instead of the book they &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; they were buying, and hopefully win over a few converts.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;People said “Just rip out the introduction and presto, you’ve got a good book” or “It’s still OK because students are smart enough to ignore the graffiti in the front, and just read the intelligent part in the back.” Maybe, but if you’ve ever had your hands on a copy and actually cracked it open, you’ve seen that this is not such an attractive proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For, while the Ray Comfort pages are nicely typeset, well designed, and festooned with illustrations, spacing, bullet points, and indentation, the Charles Darwin part has been forced through some kind of Disneyland supershrink machine. It’s been compressed into a tiny, virtually unreadable font. All breaks have been removed. There is no whitespace at all, except for a double space and a centered title at each of the 14 included chapters (not even a page break!). I don’t consider my eyes to be the worst in the world, but I can’t read it. The font is so small over these long, unbroken lines that I lose my place every time I try to go to the next line. I’d need to use a straightedge to read it, seriously. I scanned a couple representative pages from each section. Click on them to see what I’m talking about. The scans are the same size as each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was this done accidentally? Was it done to save money? Of course not. It was done to discourage readers from attempting to access the content they tried to purchase; to tie a gag around Darwin’s mouth while Comfort preaches away unrestrained. More than anything else, it reminds me of what TV networks do to the end credits of movies these days: The movie is squished into one side of the screen and made to scroll past at an accelerated rate, while the majority of the screen, and all the sound, are devoted to commercials for upcoming shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content (and many other aspects) of Comfort’s “Special Introduction” have been thoroughly covered elsewhere, so I’m not going to repeat them here. But I do feel that this one seemingly insignificant tactic, often overlooked, speaks with a very loud voice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268903967716"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=12840">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/54df2d9799150deb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="YouTube"/><title type="html">Richard Wiseman at The Big Libel Gig</title><published>2010-03-18T09:18:39Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T09:18:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/richard-wiseman-at-the-big-libel-gig/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know, you go out nowadays, you say something about someone, suddenly there’s a writ.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: More like why do we laugh at monkeys on roller skates as opposed to why are we here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Neil: -talk about that one next then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: In what sense is this an interview?  In what sense is this an interview, versus you two just saying things at me, and then holding the microphones in a way that I can’t actually respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: I’m sorry, [laughing] did you have something you wanted to say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: I do actually deal with the big philosophical- it’s not a bunch of monkeys on roller skates, I’m quite offended by that actually.  I deal with a lot of the bigger philosophical issues-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway.  So why are we here?  We’re here to in part support Simon, who’s a very good friend of mine.  We go back a long way.  And he’s got himself into a little bit of a tricky situation, because he criticized some people.  They claimed that they could do something, and he said that they couldn’t do it, when they claimed that they could.  And so he’s in a tricky situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’re here to support him, financially.  But not me personally, financially.  I made that quite clear, if anyone’s listening to this (particularly Simon).  He’s not getting a penny.  He writes me – it’s a a bit sad, actually.  Every week, a different begging letter.  I know it’s him, I know it’s him.  He signs them off differently, but I know it’s him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: No idea what to say to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: It’s sad.  Sad that it’s come down to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: You skipped to the end, when we were going to ask you to libel someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[laughing]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: I haven’t even started on that.  How long have I got?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we’re here, and lots of people have turned up.  Apparently there’s twenty in the stalls, and there’s another ten in the balcony.  So that’s thirty people already.  And they’re here to have a good evening.  We’re going to be laughing.  We’re going to be thinking a little bit.  We’ve got some proper philosophical thinkers on, not just myself.  I’ve got a couple of videos of monkeys on roller skates, and that’s pretty much the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: And to get back to the why we’re here part, it is about more than just Simon, I think.  It’s also, it’s also the larger issue of libel reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It’s about me as well? [laughing]  Tell me it’s not about me!  This isn’t for my benefit, is it?  I haven’t done anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: Actually it’s a, Richard, this an intervention.  We’re all concerned about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: Very kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Neil: You didn’t notice that these weren’t actually on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: Uh, no, no no no.  The whole thing’s a role-playing thing, that’s very very kind, thank you.  Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: Tell us how you feel about libel reform, in a more general context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard:  I think it should be reformed, because there’s not enough of it.  That’s what I think.  You know, you go out nowadays, you say something about someone, suddenly there’s a writ.  Where if we can reform it, if we can get more libel out there, more slander, then it’s just going to be a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: Well, why don’t you get us started then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: Um, well that’s what I’ll be doing this evening.  I don’t want to spoil the surprise for everyone, but I’m doing 15 minutes.  I’m going around each member of the audience, individually, and just libeling each one.  So um…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: And with only 30 people in the audience, you’ve got a good 30 seconds to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It’s not all A material, but there’s something there.  Actually, I tell you what I will say: the other performers, they’re all shit, Ok?  Except for me.  That’s libel number one.  Although actually I don’t know whether, truth, is that defense against libel?  I’m a bit confused about that one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: It is, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I’m easy on that one, I’m scot-free.  So that’s fine.  And it’s in the public interest, I believe.  I don’t know if that’s a defense.  I don’t think it is actually, with libel in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: Well, that part has to be true, actually.  It has to actually be in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: It is in the public interest to say all these people are shit.  That’s…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Neil: You don’t want people going and paying to go and see that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: Precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: Precisely.  And also there’s several authors.  There’s Ben, there’s Brian, and of course Simon.  I’m not saying all of their books are written by me.  Ok? I’m not saying I wrote every single word of “Bad Science”, Ok?  And Fermat’s last theorem.  I’m not saying that.  Because libel laws prevent me from saying it.  And that’s why we need more libel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, I am taken, I am air-brushed out of history.  And I want to be on the cover of those books, I want to be named, I want to be on the Amazon, and more importantly, I actually want some of the royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: You don’t think that air-brushing has anything to do with your looks? [laughing]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You see, if it bends it’s funny, if it breaks it isn’t.  Rebecca, it just broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: Do you need a hug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: Fuck you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Rebecca: Thank you, Richard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Neil: Richard, thank you for speaking to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Richard: Fuck the lot of you.&lt;/p&gt;

Kidding. Yeah, as silly as the Birthers seem they really do waste a lot of public officials’ time that could be better spent actually doing their jobs. And most of those wasting the time of Hawaiian officials aren’t even residents of the state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the state still gets between 10 and 20 e-mails seeking  verification of Obama’s birth each week, most of them from outside  Hawaii, Kim said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few of these requesters continue to pepper the  Health Department with the same letters seeking the same information,  even after they’re told state law bars release of a certified birth certificate  to anyone who does not have a tangible interest. Responding wastes time  and money, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Fukino and the state registrar of vital statistics have  verified that the Health Department holds Obama’s original birth  certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So considering the public has already seen official legal documents proving Obama’s Hawaiian birth, these people still refuse to accept the overwhelming evidence, and this is a frivolous waste of time, money, and resources I support this bill. Now if only we could pass a bill to get the federal government to ignore creationists, antivaxxers, and 9/11 deniers.&lt;/p&gt;

Palliative Care is a chameleon: it looks different depending on the background of the institution.

But as the editor-in-chief of the Lancet has said: &amp;quot;It is not true, until it is published.&amp;quot;  Well JAMA has published a little bit of truth with the article: &amp;quot;Availability and Integration of Palliative Care at US Cancer Centers.&amp;quot;  We have already known from CAPC data about a variability in access among states.  This data helps underscore the variability in palliative care services, staffing, education and research at major cancer centers in the US.

I won&amp;#39;t belabor the data here as it is relayed well in the abstract.  But a few things impressed me about the study.  It made a strong effort to differentiate between the simple question of &amp;#39;Do you have a palliative care program?&amp;#39; which in a few institutions I have seen consists of a well stocked brochure rack and a single staff member (usually a nurse) who has 20 other job responsibilities that are prioritized by the administration above palliative care.  Instead the authors focused on the structure, process and outcomes (also known as a Donabedian tripartite division, but of course you already knew that.)

Also a question to cancer center executive about barriers to palliative care seemed to be somewhat contradictory to other findings.  Thee highest rated barriers (around 50-60%) were: 

limited institutional budgets

poor reimbursement

limited trained palliative care staff

despite 89% of cancer centers surveyed claiming to have palliative care programs. And conversely very few center executives (less than 10%) reported the following as barriers: 

limited palliative care needs

lack of evidence for palliative care

palliative care may increase mortality

palliative care may affect national rating

palliative care available but not utilized

So if I understand this right, 89% of cancer center executives have palliative care programs with staff who get paid from the budget but the around 60% feel the biggest barrier to getting palliative care access is that there is no budget/reimbursement or staff?  

Couldn&amp;#39;t be the culture of cure (see the media study), or the fact they are a tertiary referral center focused on the &amp;#39;save&amp;#39;? Or the drive to get more patients enrolled in experimental drug trials which is a major source of funding/prestige? Or that palliative care may still not be well integrated into the culture?

I&amp;#39;m merely speculating here, but I think there is a juicy qualitative/anthropological study in this data.

One last thing...only 57% of NCI Cancer Centers had board certified palliative medicine physicians. And the data was collected in 2009.  Come on people get board certified in hospice and pallaitive medicine this fall.

&lt;p&gt;The cure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, if you're a member of the mercury militia and believe that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism, isn't the cure obvious? Come on! Think! You must know. Here's a hint: &lt;em&gt;Similia similibus curentur&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right. We're talking a &lt;a href="http://thethimerosal.blogspot.com/2010/03/great-price-for_17.html"&gt;30C dilution of homeopathic thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, baby! Why didn't anyone think of it before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, given the vast amount of data refuting the idea that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism, the idea that homeopathic thimerosal should cure autism is about as plausible, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/the_cure_for_autism.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/UeI6V5ZkD5o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268885251654"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/dr_isiss_shoe_of_the_week_26.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e28ddb578a7caa8e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weekly Shoe"/><title type="html">Dr. Isis's Shoe of the Week</title><published>2010-03-18T05:04:21Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T05:04:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/l945OuCuvuo/dr_isiss_shoe_of_the_week_26.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2010/03/dr_isiss_shoe_of_the_week_26.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spring has sprung, little muffins, and mama is so ready....&lt;/p&gt;

The data were collected using a variety of different methods.  From 1979-2006, data were collected from death certificates of U.S. residents and through alternative surveillance mechanisms from 1996-2008.  These other surveillance efforts as of 6/1/2009 include collaboration with state health authorities and of directly reported or indirectly reported cases of possible vCJD.  From 1999 onwards, text of death certificates were examined for CJD-related terms using SuperMICAR (Mortality Medical Indexing, Classification, and Retrieval system).  The study uses the annual death rate to estimate the incidence of CJD (defined as the number of new cases per year) since the majority of cases have an illness duration of less than one year.    From 1979-2006, the mean annual number of reported deaths secondary to CJD was 247 (range 172-304).  The annual age-adjusted incidence of CJD was estimated at 0.97 per million individuals.       In individuals older than 64 years of age, the incidence of CJD was estimated to be 4.8 per million individuals.       The vast majority of deaths due to CJD were reported in whites (94.6%), resulting in an age-adjusted incidence for blacks of 0.4 per million individuals.    Three deaths due to vCJD have been reported since 2004, all of which were determined to have acquired infection from outside of the U.S.  In summary, this study estimates the incidence of CJD in the U.S. to be approximately 1 per million individuals, which is in accordance with data from other countries.  The authors also describe a striking disparity between the incidence of CJD in whites and blacks.  There are several limitations to this study, including but not limited to the various methods used for surveillance at different points in time and the reliance on reported data that may not have been uniformly reported across the country.       Holman, R., Belay, E., Christensen, K., Maddox, R., Minino, A., Folkema, A., Haberling, D., Hammett, T., Kochanek, K., Sejvar, J., &amp;amp; Schonberger, L.

Three major articles came out this week.  Today JAMA published &amp;quot;Availability and Integration of Palliative Care at US Cancer Centers&amp;quot;, yesterday the Archives of Internal Medicine released &amp;quot;Cancer and the Media: How Does the News Report on Treatment and Outcomes?&amp;quot; and on the 15th CMAJ released &amp;quot;Why do patients with cancer visit the emergency department near the end of life?&amp;quot; 

(And all apparently with open access free pdf&amp;#39;s!)

Today we are going to review all three (in separate posts JAMA review here, CMAJ review here)!

So why the St. Patrick&amp;#39;s day logjam of articles?  Some may say it is mere coincidence, but I think there may be some meta-meaning here.  By the power of Grayskull Wikipedia I found that St. Patrick is very likely two different people, one of which is named Palladius...very similar to &amp;#39;palliative&amp;#39;...which is why I am sure the editors of these three journals got together to plan this bounty of articles.  (I guess the New England Journal of Medicine missed the conference call).  We will see if next year the same thing happens. Enough conspiracy talk...

This study by Fischman, Have and Casarett shines a light on the bias present in the media towards the &amp;#39;fight&amp;#39; against cancer.  The researchers looked at 8 newspapers (Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, Daily-Herald Chicago, New York Daily, New York Post, New York Times, Philadelphia Daily News , Philadelphia Inquirer) and 5 magazines (Newsweek, Parade, People, Redbook, Time).  (What no Washington Post or Cosmo?)

The main points in the articles that were coded if they were mentioned were:

Survival

Mortality

Aggressive/curative

Treatment failures

Adverse events

Palliative focus

The researchers found a very significant bias towards reporting cures/survivors (32%) over deaths (8%) and sadly only 2% that mentioned both.  Also they found that adverse events and treatment failures were rarely reported (both less than 30%).  

And of course the result you have been waiting for, 11 articles out of 436 (3%) mentioned aggressive and pallaitive measures and only 2 (two, dos, deux, zwei!) of the articles focused exclusively on end of life care exclusively.  Well the researches only searched from 2005-7 and so they missed the whole past year of New York Times articles we have been writing about. Still it is shocking in &amp;#39;cancer focused&amp;#39; articles only 0.5% mention end-of-life care exclusively?!

Pallimed was initially focused on EBM style analysis of palliative care articles, but we have expanded our scope to report on palliative care in the media also, and this study justifies the importance of getting the story about good palliative care into the main media news cycles.  It is not just enough that there are articles about cancer treatments (mainly read by cancer patients and their families) or articles about hospice or palliative care programs (read by hospice and palliative care staff and families with hospice experience.) We need articles that combine the two so people are equally exposed to the balance of treatments that exist out there.  Few patients or families facing cancer diagnoses will choose to read the &amp;#39;hospice is valuable&amp;#39; headline when juxtaposed with a &amp;#39;new cancer treatment&amp;#39; headline.

But it is important to understand the view of the journalist and editors as well.  &amp;#39;New cancer treatment&amp;#39; headlines may sell more copies than &amp;#39;hospice is valuable&amp;#39; headlines.  Also a new treatment being available is news because it is new, different, interesting.  Having articles about how people have poor survival with a cancer diagnosis is not new, different or interesting.  Palliative care and hospice organizations need to make sure the journalists and editors hear the great stories we see every day in our work.  The human interest perspective is very powerful.  Some hospices are better at connecting with the media than others.  Maybe it was time we all had a lesson in how to best interact professionally with the media.

For reference I have uploaded a slidedeck I gave at the NHPCO conference in 2007 titled: Working With  the Media: How to Reach the Widest Audience Possible.  It is embedded below.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Today, based on new information, doctors allege the study violated medical ethics and regulatory law. PositiveID appears to have abused science for profit, banking on public and even professional ignorance of medical ethics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:12pt"&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; 

&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;PositiveID, known as VeriChip at the time of the study, markets the world’s first human-implantable microchip, approved by the FDA for medical use in 2004. (In 2005, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson resigned from government and joined the company’s board.) The rice-grain sized device is stuck into the flesh with a nearly foot-long syringe. It contains a serial number that can be read by a scanner and then matched with a person’s online medical profile in an emergency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;PositiveID and Alzheimer’s Community Care claimed Alzheimer’s patients were in special need of implantation. The CEO of the ACC, Mary Barnes, told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;USA Today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; that the chip “could be invaluable in identifying lost patients – for instance, if a hurricane strikes Florida.” But Dr. Robin Fiore, a professor of ethics at Florida Atlantic University and a national lecturer on medicine, said Barnes’ claim amounts to pseudo-science. Usually, the difficulty is in finding missing Alzheimer's patients, not identifying them. “This is not going to find lost people,” she said, noting that PositiveID’s chips are not GPS-equipped. “And if [the patients’ caregivers] think this will help them find their lost loves ones, they’re just confused. They’ve just been misinformed.” Mrs. Barnes also told &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;USA Today &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;that “both the patients and their legal guardians must consent to the implants before receiving them.” To the contrary, PositiveID admits that many patients were unable to give informed consent, so their legal guardians enrolled them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;On his Fox News show last October, Glenn Beck reinforced the idea that the chip is a big help to Alzheimer’s patients, while dispelling conspiracy theories about the company. “They have fantastic technology if you’re an Alzheimer’s patient,” he assured. But “it’s very, very bad if, say, Hitler has this technology.” He urged his viewers to be skeptical. “You must stay vigilant, be aware, watch for it… I know the times we’re living in.Vigilance is the key word.” If Glenn Beck had not merely repeated the word “vigilance” and instead approached the company as a skeptic, he would have discovered that the experiment on Alzheimer’s patients lacked standard scientific oversight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;As PositiveID spokeswoman Allison Tomek now admits, no Institutional Review Board (IRB) ever approved the study, which ended in 2009. IRBs are integral to sound medical science. As panels of experts and laymen, they’re supposed to authorize and oversee all studies on humans in order to guard against abuse and protect subjects&amp;#39; rights. According to four experts, PositiveID’s study would’ve required an IRB under federal regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;In a phone interview, Mrs. Tomek offered an excuse for not getting one. She insisted the Alzheimer’s initiative was a “project, not a study.” In an email, she explained: “…Our relationship with Alzheimer’s Community Care to provide their patients and caregivers with the microchip… was not a research study or experiment, so IRB review is not required.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Her claim is belied by a company press release in which PositiveID CEO Scott Silverman explicitly called the initiative a study. “We are extremely pleased to partner with Alzheimer's Community Care on this relevant study,” he said. And, in filings to the SEC, PositiveID again called it a “two-year, 200 patient study.” The filing states: “We believe that if the results of these and other clinical studies… are sufficiently compelling, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services may determine that the Health Link microchip… is reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid.” The transformation of the “study” into a “project” seems to be a recent semantic development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Reached by phone, the CEO of Alzheimer’s Community Care, Mary Barnes, repeated the mantra that it was a so-called project. “We did participate in a project with [PositiveID],” she said, pausing dramatically. “A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;. We had legal documents reviewed by counsel. The project was for the benefit of patients and caregivers…” When asked if the ACC had gotten an IRB, she abruptly hung up the phone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;“Whether you call it a project or a study is irrelevant,” said Dr. Robin Fiore, the FAU professor. “You could call it Fred. It’s obviously human subjects research.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Dr. Kenneth Goodman, head of the University of Miami’s Bioethics Program, said of the study: “Any research that does not include an IRB does not meet the ethical standard.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;PositiveID’s study may have violated more than just a universal ethical standard for research. Dr. Deborah Peel, a practicing physician and founder of two national organizations on patient privacy, said in a phone interview that she thought the study “probably violates federal law.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;FAU professor Dr. Fiore agreed: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;“The problem here is failure to conform to regulations governing research,” Dr. Fiore said. “So it’s a regulatory violation subject to fines.” She confirmed PositiveID could even lose its FDA approval for the microchip. “It’s possible. That’s pretty nuclear, so the violation would have to be egregious."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;And a CDC official in charge of regulating human research, who asked to remain anonymous, concurred, calling the study a “slam-dunk regulatory violation.” He elaborated in an email: “To conduct [a study] without independent review is not right — it may place people who have volunteered their time at risk… In terms of regulation, the device is not approved for this use, it falls under FDA regulation, and it requires independent review by an IRB.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;FDA press spokeswoman Karen Riley said by phone that she had asked the FDA’s own ethicists whether the study required an IRB. The answer she got was yes. “The bottom line is you would need an IRB because it’s a trial of a medical device,” she said. Another FDA spokesman, Dick Thompson, confirmed the study wouldn’t have been ethical without an IRB, but left the legal question open. In an email, he said: “We can&amp;#39;t make a determination about this particular study based on the information we have in hand.” But, he said: “In general, we believe an IRB or its equivalent is ethically appropriate — if not required — for any study involving a human population, especially a population of vulnerable people such as those with Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Dr. Fiore articulated the risks of doing the study on Alzheimer’s patients. “There’s the question about implanting something in a person that may have health risks for frail people: their skin doesn’t heal as well and they’re much more subject to infections.” Alluding to reports in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;from 2005 that the chips caused tumors in mice, she also said: “It’s important to note that their [2004] FDA approval came before the information about the potential cancer risks occurred…The question of whether those are reasonable risks to express to people is part of what the IRB would have to decide. Without an IRB, I’m guessing they would never be mentioned."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;It’s also doubtful whether PositiveID let test subjects know that the chip, according to its own manual, could malfunction in ambulances and around MRIs and X-ray machines due to radio interference. That would call into question the chip’s very purpose as a means of pulling up a person’s medical information in ambulances and hospitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;What makes PositiveID’s alleged regulatory violation especially worrying is that the company announced last December it will be conducting a study on people with diabetes in Florida. Asked if there would be an IRB for that study, the company’s spokeswoman, Mrs. Tomek, said there “might or might not, depending on the elements in the study.” Meanwhile, Alzheimer’s Community Care, whose CEO hung up the phone rather than disclose whether her organization consulted an IRB, has been nominated for the 2010 “Best Practices Award” for non-profits by Palm Beach County’s Clerk and Comptroller.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt"&gt;Capping off the irony, this June the ACC and PositiveID will launch the 2010 Alzheimer’s Educational Conference, attracting speakers from across the United States to “educate family caregivers and healthcare professionals about the latest research and standards of care for those with Alzheimer's.” Given the accusation that the ACC and PositiveID flouted FDA regulations, those companies may be the ones most in need of an education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

From the list's &lt;a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LINGUIST List is dedicated to providing information on language and language analysis, and to providing the discipline of linguistics with the infrastructure necessary to function in the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
LINGUIST maintains a website with thousands of pages and runs a mailing list with tens of thousands of subscribers worldwide. LINGUIST also hosts searchable archives of over 100 other linguistic mailing lists and runs research projects to develop tools for the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LINGUIST mailing list provides a space for open discussion, reviews of publications, job listings, information on conferences, and much more. LINGUIST also runs an Ask A Linguist service, where people can get answers to questions about language and linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list is an incredible resource for linguistics, deserving of your support. Small donations are welcome, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Information for donors is on the site, along with special features like a "linguist of  the day" writing about how they got into the field. This year's writers are Claire Bowern, Dafydd Gibbon, C. T. James Huang, Pius ten Hacken, Anna Wierzbicka, and Anthony Woodbury. Four Language Loggers have been honored this way in the five years LINGUIST has provided this feature.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268878514793"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=4838">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e4a0a99ef14f4e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Holly Robinson Peete on Huffington Post</title><published>2010-03-18T00:46:48Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T00:46:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/IUJioz6agN4/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Left Brain/Right Brain</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268878514781"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=4836">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3cf2f0849b88b2a6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Arthur Allen in Readers Digest and the false claims of false vaccine safety groups</title><published>2010-03-17T20:43:36Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T20:43:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/dYR_FWfoK0s/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268878454606"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/four_stone_hearth_4.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4c3bebd04f28f8c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Four Stone Hearth</title><published>2010-03-18T03:04:50Z</published><updated>2010-03-18T03:04:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/cF2VN5B7wIM/four_stone_hearth_4.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2010/03/four_stone_hearth_4.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Four Field Anthropology Blog Carnival, Four Stone Heath, is up at the blog Ad Hominin. &lt;a href="http://adhominin.com/files/four_stone_hearth_88.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By misusing philosophical distinctions and misinterpreting the  literature on natural selection, Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini make a  mess of what could have been an important contribution. The authors are  correct in two of their assessments. Namely that: mainstream  evolutionary biology has become complacent with the nearly 70-year-old  Modern Synthesis, which reconciled the original theory of natural  selection with Mendelian and population genetics; and that the field  needs to extend the conceptual arsenal of evolutionary theory. But in  claiming that there are fundamental flaws in an edifice that has  withstood a century and a half of critical examination, Fodor and  Piattelli-Palmarini err horribly. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini offer only sterile and wrongheaded  criticism. Fortunately, other philosophers of science and theoretical  biologists are coming together to clarify and build on the conceptual  foundations of science and explore issues of its practice; this is a  better way to bridge the two cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “important contribution” that F&amp;amp;P-P fail to make, apparently, is the contribution that Pigliucci himself is bent on making, for that “extension” of neo-Darwinism is laid out in a soon-to-appear book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evolution-Extended-Synthesis-Massimo-Pigliucci/dp/0262513676"&gt;Evolution: The Extended Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;edited by Pigliucci and Gerd Müller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Fodor and Piattelli-Palmarini?  Well, they’ll claim that Pigliucci is just another philosopher who has failed to grasp their point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own review of &lt;em&gt;What Darwin Got Wrong&lt;/em&gt; will appear in four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

When things get too heavy just call me helium, the lightest known gas to man. &lt;i&gt;-Jimi Hendrix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hendrix is almost right: helium is the &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; lightest gas known to man, behind hydrogen.  But there are many applications for helium -- both scientific and non-scientific -- that make it incredibly useful and practical.  Helium is far lighter than air &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; is inert, which means it won't combust when you combine it with air and energy, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_disaster"&gt;like Hydrogen does&lt;/a&gt; (below).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/hindenburg.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/hindenburg-thumb-500x387-42901.gif" width="500" height="387" alt="hindenburg.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Too bad for the kids who &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; hydrogen balloons for their birthday parties!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being lighter than air, Helium is incredibly useful, scientifically, in its &lt;b&gt;liquid&lt;/b&gt; form!  With a boiling point of only 4 Kelvin, liquid helium is used to cool some of the most powerful electromagnets on Earth, including those at Fermilab and the Large Hadron Collider.  It's the first known &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfluid"&gt;superfluid&lt;/a&gt;, a fluid that has many interesting properties, including absolutely no viscosity, and it will never come to rest or lose energy once you start it in motion!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/2Z6UJbwxBZI%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=315" width="500" height="315"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But -- as &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/going_going_gone/"&gt;Lee Billings wrote earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; -- Helium is pretty rare on Earth, and &lt;b&gt;we're running out of it&lt;/b&gt;.  Although Helium is the second most common element in the Universe (behind Hydrogen), it's &lt;i&gt;incredibly&lt;/i&gt; rare on Earth.  There are only two places to find Helium.  The first is the Earth's atmosphere.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/atmosph.jpg" width="493" height="368" alt="atmosph.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exosphere -- the uppermost layer of the atmosphere -- contains small amounts of Helium.  Compared to the rest of the atmosphere, &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/going_going_gone/"&gt;five parts per million&lt;/a&gt; are Helium, which means that extracting Helium from the atmosphere is incredibly inefficient and expensive, so much so that &lt;b&gt;we don't do it&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do we get our Helium from, then?  Believe it or not, we mine it from &lt;i&gt;underground!&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/Communications_Directorate.Par.7570.Image.-1.-1.1.gif.jpeg" width="500" alt="Communications_Directorate.Par.7570.Image.-1.-1.1.gif.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This above image is the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's Crude Helium Enrichment Facility in Texas.  It supplies about 40% of the Helium produced in my country, and it all comes from pockets of Helium that live underground.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to know how it got there?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/radioactive_warning_sign2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/radioactive_warning_sign2-thumb-500x417-42907.jpg" width="500" height="417" alt="radioactive_warning_sign2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right; &lt;i&gt;radioactivity&lt;/i&gt;!  You see, when our Earth was formed, it was loaded up with a whole slew of unstable elements, including everything on the periodic table that's heavier than Lead, such as Uranium, Thorium, Radium, and Radon.  Since these elements are unstable, they &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay"&gt;radioactively decay&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/radioactive-atom.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/radioactive-atom-thumb-500x309-42909.gif" width="500" height="309" alt="radioactive-atom.gif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though some of these elements take billions of years to decay (on average), the Earth has been around for billions of years!  Not only that, but there are three ways that particles can decay.  The first type discovered -- &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_particle"&gt;alpha decay&lt;/a&gt; -- is when a radioactive particle emits a &lt;b&gt;Helium nucleus&lt;/b&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a couple of electrons, and what have you got?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce/helium-atom.gif" width="500" alt="helium-atom.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helium!  So if you get an ore of the right type of radioactive element, and you wait millions and millions (or even billions) of years, &lt;b&gt;you make a giant underground store of helium&lt;/b&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the good news is that these underground stores exist, so we have a supply of Helium for all of our scientific (and non-scientific) purposes.  But the bad news?  When we use it up, we'll have to wait &lt;i&gt;million of years&lt;/i&gt; for it to build back up, or figure out some non-prohibitively expensive way to recover it from the atmosphere.  (It's so expensive that many are thinking of &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2006/12/72276"&gt;mining the Moon&lt;/a&gt; when we're out of it on Earth!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm all for environmentalism and conservation, but &lt;i&gt;even if you aren't&lt;/i&gt;, running out of Helium poses a serious problem for the continuing advancement of science and technology.  Helium on Earth is scarce.  It took millions of years to make the stores we have now, and once they're gone, they'll be gone for thousands of generations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So be careful with the precious things you have, and treat them like the precious things they &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;, even if others don't.  Because some of them -- like Helium -- are truly irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2010/03/why_is_helium_so_scarce.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268867174491"><id gr:original-id="http://www.lucasbrouwers.nl/blog/2010/03/on-the-origin-of-animals/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8c921b9331539ffe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">On the Origin of Animals</title><published>2010-03-17T17:52:34Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T17:52:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/9NnjN-HwBBU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.lucasbrouwers.nl/blog/2010/03/on-the-origin-of-animals/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Think of an animal – any animal you’d like.

Wrong. Everyone knows the current Pope is most properly addressed as &amp;quot;Pope Palpatine&amp;quot;. No, Pope Palpatine is not currently up for canonization (at least, I hope not), but there is another pope who is, and &lt;a href="http://www.youngausskeptics.com/2010/03/nazis-earthworms-and-dodgy-journalism/"&gt;this thorough discussion explains who Dawkins was actually talking about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blatantly evident in this clip, Richard Dawkins uses &amp;quot;Pope Nazi&amp;quot; as a shorthand descriptive phrase for &amp;quot;that Pope whose name I&amp;#39;ve forgotten (Pope Pius XII) — who&amp;#39;s also up for canonisation and was aiding and abetting the Nazis during the war&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's the clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D10226561%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=225" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/10226561"&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/user3396450"&gt;Young Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Pope Pius XII really was a sniveling rat bastard who should have been held accountable for contributing to the evil perpetrated against the Jews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/a_clarification_of_dawkins_com.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Gv009piWEVs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268866068485"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/patriot_bible_university_has_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66d761c92a735654</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Patriot Bible University has a website!</title><published>2010-03-17T22:12:21Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T22:12:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/kvwKzWCif48/patriot_bible_university_has_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/patriot_bible_university_has_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kent Hovind&amp;#39;s infamous alma mater has put together a collection of responses because they are &amp;quot;under attack!&amp;quot; Only they aren&amp;#39;t—they&amp;#39;re being laughed at. And whoa, these pages are even more hilarious. (Warning: all of the links below go to pages that fire up some tedious piano music on autoplay…that you can&amp;#39;t turn off.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href="http://www.patriotuniversity.com/PriceofTruth.htm"&gt;offended at the falsehoods their critics promulgate&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, people have passed around this photo, claiming it is a picture of the Patriot University facilities:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/patriot_bible_university_has_a/pat1.jpeg" width="400" height="222" alt="pat1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a filthy lie! That is the minister's house. To show how wrong this portrayal is, the staff at Patriot Bible University have released an &lt;i&gt;official&lt;/i&gt; photograph of the wonderfully elegant, high-tech but traditional campus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/patriot_bible_university_has_a/pat2.jpeg" width="400" height="300" alt="pat2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well. I guess we can't make fun of &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second page can be summarized as &lt;a href="http://www.patriotuniversity.com/priceoftruth2.htm"&gt;"Don't trust the internet, trust us!"&lt;/a&gt; They explain what is wrong with the internet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you trust someone's 'factual' information about morals when they post pornography, promote homosexuality, post curse words, and claim evolution as fact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa, somebody pass that along to the Intersection! I'm sure it will fit with their sentiment perfectly. Patriot University also has a simple test for evaluating the worth of a web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would Jesus agree with the values and the message of the source of advice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this instantly stirred up an image of introducing Jesus to &lt;a href="http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?archives=all"&gt;Dan Savage&lt;/a&gt;. My vision of Jesus is of an unkempt Jewish zealot with a madman&amp;#39;s fire in his eye and a dedication to those old testament laws, and no, I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;d get along with Dan at all — there&amp;#39;d probably be an impromptu stoning on the spot. But Christians always tell me that their version of Jesus is gentle, loving, understanding, and thoughtful — that Jesus would probably give Dan a big hug and thank him for his work. Which Jesus are we supposed to use in this exercise from PU? And isn&amp;#39;t this an admission that you&amp;#39;re just supposed to go along with stuff you like, assisted by the crutch of an imaginary cheerleader?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also list the virtues of PU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I. Patriot bases all teachings on the Bible and God's absolute truth.&lt;br&gt;
II. Patriot has been teaching God's absolute truth for nearly 30 years.&lt;br&gt;
III. Jesus said "He is the way, the truth, and the life" (Jn 14:6). Patriot believes this and follows Jesus, only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, yeah. I'm reassured.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, they get around to &lt;a href="http://www.patriotuniversity.com/PriceOfTruth3.html"&gt;discussing Kent Hovind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patriot does not retain ownership to student thesis' or dissertations, as is commonly practiced by many schools. Instead, Patriot grants each student full control over the circulation of his/her work. Therefore, Patriot cannot release student work to the public. Patriot issues Bible degrees for the purpose of equipping students for ministry; Patriot is not a research institution.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hovind's dissertation was part of a graduate "project". Thus, the paper being posted online was only a portion of Hovind's initial research notes for his dissertation requirements. It is obviously not a finished product.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hovind has been a prolific publisher of videos and books on topics involving Biblical Creation. He has participated in numerous video-taped debates. His work since 1991 has been widely distributed and stands on it's own and supercedes an earlier written dissertation. There is no need to attack it and ignore what he has produced since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that thesis that was posted on Wikileaks wasn't actually Kent Hovind's thesis. PU does not keep copies of theses, they are not submitted to any official archive, so basically, it doesn't exist. Huh. Well, that certainly sounds professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ragbag collection of noise that begins, "Hi, my name is Kent Hovind" was part of a "project". What project could benefit from such haphazard trash, I don't know. It clearly wasn't a finished product. Where is the finished product? Don't ask the degree-granting institution!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Kent Hovind's work since 1991 does stand on its own as rank raving idiocy. We laugh at that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strangely, this defense of Kent Hovind doesn't mention his current residency in a penitentiary, convicted of tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

The conversations that take place in the blogosphere have real value (a value which is so far under-recognized and under-utilized).  Without the blogosphere, I would never be exposed to many of the things I read online, such as basic research in neuroanatomy and drug abuse, physiology, and primatology.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest in primatology is sort of like love of chocolate---I suspect most of us are born with it.  As the Bare Naked Ladies sang, "Haven't you always wanted a monkey?" I suspect that the more an animal appeals to us, either as being similar or being cute, the more we tend to endow it with human characteristics.  We are narcissistic both as individuals and as a species, and we see more value in an animal the more "human" it is.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think anyone would be hard-pressed to say that a bonobo is not more like us than an opossum.  But that doesn't mean that bonobos are little people. We are---I think rightly---more likely to respect the needs of humans than other animals, and we tend to create an informal hierarchy of which animals can be treated in which ways, often based on our perceptions of an animal's ability to perceive and understand noxious stimuli.  Most of us feel comfortable swatting a mosquito just because it bothers us, but few of us would approve of killing a chimpanzee just because it looks at us funny.  A high school biology student may cut paramecia into bits to see what happens and sleep well that evening, but if they were asked to do the same to an ape, they would likely balk (I hope).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These admittedly obvious and somewhat unsophisticated observations arose because of a post I read today over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2010/03/why_i_am_not_a_humanist.php"&gt;the Primate Diaries&lt;/a&gt;.  In it, Eric Michael Johnson uses a clever writing device to argue for a moral stance greater than humanism, one that explicitly places us face-to-face with non-human primates.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I agree with Eric's implicit point that our views and treatment of other animals is more complex than we sometimes realize.  In fact, it is my agreement with this general tone that creates for me an impression that his entire post is flawed beyond redemption. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My studies in evolutionary biology revealed that, far from privileging humans as separate from the web of life, we were intricately interwoven within it. Furthermore, the difference between any human and any chimpanzee was less than between that chimpanzee and a gorilla. We are, in fact, the third chimpanzee, a naked ape who donned fine clothing and manners as a way to mask our animal heritage. Humanism, at least in the view of many adherents, removes supernatural justifications for human uniqueness yet emphasizes the importance of "civilized man" as something separate from mere beasts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many (but not all) religions view human beings as unique among animals (or even separate from animals).  While supernatural explanations for this uniqueness are absurd, there are plenty of non-absurd arguments of why we are not "just another ape".  We are, of course, apes, but we are apes with a completely different set of abilities that makes us unique.  And we are us, an observation that in itself sets apart from other animals.  Finding a non-superstitious way to understand what makes us different from other animals and what this may or may not mean is tricky.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanism is appealing to those who eschew the supernatural.  It recognizes the responsibilities of human beings to each other and our role in a natural world rather than a supernatural one. There is not any requirement to see humans as "other" than nature, but we are, in an important way, different from other animals.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That difference is very important when evaluating behaviors.  Earth vertebrates share many physical, anatomic, physiologic, and behavioral characteristics, but the &lt;i&gt;meaning&lt;/i&gt; of behaviors is much harder to evaluate than the function of a voltage-gated ion channel.  Humans have systems of examining the meanings behind our behaviors; some are obvious.  When I'm hungry, I go to the fridge.  But even such a simple behavior in humans can have many other meanings depending on how one views food, one's body image, etc.  Other animals may have similar-appearing behaviors, but that does not make these behaviors identical to their human analogues.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since mind is a brain-dependent phenomenon, there are often anatomic correlates to our behaviors, and even to our beliefs, but since other animals do not utilize complex language, we will never know if they have "beliefs" which correlate with behavior or anatomy.  We don't really understand what it means for a human to have post-traumatic stress disorder, so when we say that an elephant has it, there is no way to know if that set of behaviors is anything like our own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what really disturbs me about Eric's piece is not the lack of sophistication or naivete; I am guilty of these as well.  It is the unwritten purpose behind the piece, the obvious implication: if we are animals, and animals are human, than we must grant them the same rights as we grant each other.  This I find impractical and absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/MFPuro5mEKA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268864215986"><id gr:original-id="http://averyremoteperiodindeed.blogspot.com/2010/03/quartz-cretan-handaxes-and-paleolithic.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/255bff6e249bb887</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Quartz, Cretan handaxes and Paleolithic seafaring</title><published>2010-03-17T17:13:03Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T17:13:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/Pqkme7cLni4/quartz-cretan-handaxes-and-paleolithic.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://averyremoteperiodindeed.blogspot.com/2010/03/quartz-cretan-handaxes-and-paleolithic.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A couple of months ago, I posted on the recent discovery of quartz hand axes on Crete by Strasser and Runnels. That post spurred quite a bit of discussion, and I also provided some additional thoughts shortly thereafter, based on the colonization of Cyprus. Since then, we've learned that these implements will be described in detail in the June issues of the journal Hesperia, and some decent photographs of some of the implements in question were published, which provides some more convincing data to sink your teeth into. Spurred by a paper I recently read (Broodbank 2006 - free pdf here), I figured I'd post my last impressions on this discovery until the paper actually comes out.First, here's what one of those handaxes looks like (views from the front, two sides and back of the piece):http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/science/16archeo.htmlMore photographs are also available in a nice slideshow provided by Boston University press release, and they give you an idea of the size of the handaxes and of how they might have been handled.  The thing with quartz, however, is that it's very hard to see flaking landmarks on photographs. For what it's worth, I still think that at least that handaxe looks very rough in craftsmanship (e.g., uneven thinning, apparently no basal thinning, very sinuous edges). Although that's not too unusual for pieces on quartz, I really hope that this one's not their best looking one!To summarize the debate a bit, Strasser, Runnels and company have found these quartz implements whose morphology is reminiscent of that of handaxes in deposits dating to ca. 130,000 years BP on Crete. This is significant because Crete appears to have remained an island detached from the European mainland for most of the Pleistocene, which implies any tool maker on the island must have originally arrived there through some form of seafaring.The record of Lower Paleolithic finds on Mediterranean islands is largely unconvincing. As Broodbank (2006:204) states:"Claims of Lower and MiddlePalaeolithic finds on the islands divide, asMussi (2001: 86) notes, into those that arereliably documented but derive from locationsthat were not insular at the time (suchas Capri [Mussi 2001: 86]), and those foundon definite palaeo-islands but that are contentiousin terms of their identification asartefacts rather than geofacts, or whose datingis uncertain, due to either the low diagnosticityof the material itself, or the lack of ascientifically dated context. A few cases, suchas a possible Lower Palaeolithic find fromCorfu (Kourtessi-Philippaki 1999: 283-84; cf.Runnels 1995: 235 n. 48), fit both categories.Where such claims have been subjected to rigorousanalysis, including re-examination of thematerial and findspot, the conclusions havetended to be negative."Perhaps not insignificantly, one of the authors Broodbank cites as urging caution about accepting some of these early find uncritically is C. Runnels, who's one of the discoverers of the Cretan handaxes. Given their age, however, these implements are not really relevant to the question of a Lower Paleolithic settlement of Crete. However, they are very relevant to the question of Middle Paleolithic settlement of those landmasses. On this topic, Broodbank (2006:204-205) proposes that:"Slightly more convincing, and thereforeintriguing, are a handful of findspots of probableMiddle Palaeolithic stone tools fromseveral of the smaller Greek islands, notablyin the Sporades (Efstratiou 1985: 5-6, 56-59)and Ionian islands (Dousougli 1999; Kavvadias1984; Kourtessi-Philliapaki 1999), butpotentially also on Melos in the Cyclades(Chelidonio 2001). In the first and secondcases, the findspots lie close to foci of MiddlePalaeolithic activity in, respectively, Thessaly,and Epirus/Albania/Dalmatia (Runnels1995: 238-39; Runnels et al. 2004). In mostinstances—probably all of the Sporades, savethe perhaps erroneous case of Skyros, forwhich the only report is a newspaper articlewritten almost half a century ago (Cherry1981: 44), plus Corfu and Lefkas in the Ioniangroup—the islands concerned were almostcertainly joined to the mainland at the lowersea levels that existed after the last interglacial(Oxygen Isotope Stage 5e, dated to 128-118,000 years ago). More interesting is thecase of Kephallonia (and probably conjoinedZakynthos [Kourtessi-Phillipaki 1999: 284-86]), where the tools, albeit not associatedwith dated contexts, do seem bona fide, andthe island, although in a fault zone subjectto massive vertical movement, is likely onbathymetric grounds to have been separatedfrom the mainland by one or more gaps of afew kilometres (less than the 20 km reportedin Cherry 1990: 171). Still more surprising, butunsupported by detailed study of material andcontext, or independent dating, are the findsfrom Melos, which would have been attainableonly via a chain of inter-island links, includingsea-crossings in the order of 10 km at averageMiddle Palaeolithic sea level stands."There therefore seems to be some prior evidence of potential evidence of a Middle Paleolithic on some of the Greek islands, albeit somewhat debatable and mostly found on islands relatively close to the mainland. That being the case, it may be that, if the Cretan material is shown to be unambiguous, it represents one more instance of fleeting island hopping. No matter, how fleeting, however, this behavior has profound implications for the behavior of the hominins (most likely Neanderthals) who engaged in it."Could it be thatthe markedly indented coastline and mass ofoffshore islands in the Ionian and Aegean seastriggered a slight ‘stretching’ of behaviour?Visits to the nearby Ionian islands from thelarge base camps identified on the oppositemainland are certainly compatible with whatwe know of Neanderthal short-range mobility(Gamble 1999: 239-43, 266), and also withsome simple propelled floating technique, butvisits as far afield as Melos are less so inboth respects. The potential implications forthe earliest Mediterranean maritime activityand, equally, for Neanderthal cognitive andlearning abilities (Stringer and Gamble 1993;Mithen 2005), are therefore quite substantial.A thorough investigation of the Kephallonianand Melian finds, combined with scientificdating of their contexts, is clearly essential.(Broodbank 2006:205)"This echoes (and explains!) a lot of the press coverage that's been focused on these finds, and clearly underscores the potential significance of these stone tools. With that in mind, then, the Hesperia paper will need to clearly do the following in order for the finds to be considered credible:Provide some radiometric ages of the deposits in which the tools were found;Explain how the tools ended up in these deposits (i.e., are they in primary or secondary context? If secondary, where was the primary context?);Discuss why quartz seems to have been the raw material of choice when there are other sources of better quality workable stone on the island, which were exploited by later occupants;Present some information on the production sequences of these implements showing patterned human action;Distinguish this material from later (i.e., post-agricultural) occurrences of 'rough' stone tools made on coarse-grained raw materials; and Explain why a Middle Paleolithic industry should be comprised predominantly of Lower Paleolithic type implements (unless, of course, the handaxes got all the glory in the press reports and there actually is more to this assemblage).Personally, I'd be very excited if these turned out to be credible, as it would provide further evidence of the flexibility of Middle Paleolithic hominins and force us to rethink how they engaged with their larger ecological realities. Also, it'd probably spur some new research on Paleolithic-age deposits in Mediterranean islands. This last point would be especially important, in my view, becau...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It's said to be the Blackfoot version of the English phrase "Normal is the cycle on a washing machine".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Army Institute of Heraldry's &lt;a href="http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=2898"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; on the AWG shows its shoulder sleeve insignia to be "a black circular device edged with a 1/8 inch (.32 cm) black border, a  red horizontal arrow, pointing to the left",  as shown in the upper right corner of this post.  But the banner on the AWG's &lt;a href="http://www.awg.army.mil/"&gt;own page&lt;/a&gt; shows the same insignia with the cited motto in red around the circumference of the patch, as reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/AWGBanner.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/AWGBanner.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The Stars and Stripes article says that the motto &amp;quot;came from a book about the Vietnam War […] [and] was translated in honor of an AWG member who was a member of the Blackfoot Nation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Versions of the saying "Normal is (just|only|nothing_but) the|a cycle|setting on the|a washing machine" has been around for a while, and it sounds like a Vietnam-era kind of sentiment. The phrase apparently is used in John McAfee's 1993 Vietnam novel &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slow-Walk-Sad-Rain-Catch-22/dp/1570901775"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slow walk in a sad rain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and given the  description of the AWG in Stars and Stripes, and the description of the book in &lt;a href="http://http//books.google.com/books?id=0eg-PgAACAAJ"&gt;this review&lt;/a&gt;, it may well be the source of the motto:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The story begins in Special Forces A Camp, number 413, twenty miles from the Cambodian border. The camp&amp;#39;s Green Berets, dividing their time between boredom and terror, are ostensibly led by a captain, the narrator of the story. But the officer actually takes his cue from an aggressive sergeant named Shotgun who is alternately crazy and wise, but always irresistibly, frighteningly dangerous. The altogether appropriate motto of A Camp is &amp;quot;Normal is a cycle on a washing machine.&amp;quot; Commanding officers issue orders that have no meaning; weapons are used in ways that are the grotesque opposite of their original design. And in an experience that has a real-life counterpart, the Green Berets stumble on a shocking alliance between the CIA and North Vietnam, something they realize they must destroy — even at the cost of bringing both sides down on them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4125"&gt;Biologie Totale and other bastard offspring of Ryke Geerd Hamer’s German New Medicine &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (David Gorski)  Biologie totale is a French offshoot of a German cancer quackery based on the idea that cancer is caused by psychological conflicts. It blames the victim, and it kills people by persuading them to abandon conventional cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4129"&gt;A nutritional approach to the treatment of HIV infection – same old woo?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Peter Lipson)  Dr. Jon Kaiser treats AIDS patients with the nutritional supplement K-PAX along with other modalities. His credentials are suspect, he claims an unbelievable success rate, and his published pilot study is not only entirely unconvincing but fails to disclose his conflict of interest as the maker and seller of the product being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4117"&gt;Halsted: The Father of Science-Based Surgery &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Harriet Hall) A new biography tells how modern science-based medical education originated at Johns Hopkins and how Dr. William Stewart Halsted was directly responsible for the major innovations (like wearing gloves) that created modern surgery.  His accomplishments were all the more remarkable in that he was addicted to cocaine and morphine for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4169"&gt;The 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Yale Research Symposium on Complementay and Integrative Medicine. Part II.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Kimball Atwood) The second of a two-part series describing this conference at Yale, covering a debate between Steven Novella and integrative medicine proponent David Katz that highlighted the issue of plausibility. Dr. Atwood further describes his own encounters with Dr. Katz that revealed Katz’s naïveté and gullibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178"&gt;Plausibility in Science-Based Medicine &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Steven Novella) Following up on the Yale Symposium, Dr. Novella refutes the straw men arguments of CAM proponents and explains what prior plausibility really means, and why it is so important for science-based medicine to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4036"&gt;CAM on campus: Integrative Medicine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(Tim Kreider) A report on how CAM was presented to first-year medical students in a mandatory lecture by a respected faculty member and administrator. While he was not an outspoken proponent of CAM, he repeated fallacious arguments and said nothing to discourage even the most ridiculous modalities like homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4182"&gt;Just the Facts &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Mark Crislip) A survey showed that anti-vaccine websites were filled with misinformation and falsehoods, complaints about infringement of civil liberties, and conspiracy theories; only Wikipedia was free of taint. The facts don’t seem to matter much to CAM proponents and anti-vaccine activists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Latino-Americans have traditionally been dependable Catholics, though they are slowly but surely &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2010-03-16-latinoreligion16_ST_N.htm"&gt;becoming more religiously diverse&lt;/a&gt;, as seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TxtOpAB0ckU/S6AYjVPDeUI/AAAAAAAAA8Y/f3Nsxj_G--Y/s1600-h/Latino+Religion.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TxtOpAB0ckU/S6AYjVPDeUI/AAAAAAAAA8Y/f3Nsxj_G--Y/s400/Latino+Religion.gif" border="0" alt="" width="227" height="378"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;Notice the number who report no religion has almost doubled from 1990 to 2008, going from 6.4% to 12.4%. This is encouraging, because it shows that cultural influences can drive people to become more moderate and enlightened in their religious beliefs. Hopefully, other cultures can benefit from assimilation in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;

I know a few of the skeptics from around there, and as you’d expect of Canadians they are warm, fun, and very polite. If you’re in that area, I suggest you go; Skepticamps are a great way to meet new like-minded folks and also hear some great talks about topics you might not hear about otherwise. I’ve been to one and had a great time, so go!&lt;/p&gt;

I assume what he did is correct, since the only Italian I know is how to say &amp;quot;I am wounded,&amp;quot; which I learned from my dad’s WWII phrase books he had.&lt;/p&gt;

Used to be, if I wanted to figure out what people were reading, I’d ask a few friends. This week, I got replies from 761 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/03/15/the-science-reader-help-me-draw-a-profile/"&gt;asked you&lt;/a&gt; to help me get a better sense of the science reader–how the science reader gets a science fix, what the science reader values, and what the science reader expects from the future. Thanks to everyone who responded–both directly to the survey questions and indirectly in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/03/15/the-science-reader-help-me-draw-a-profile/#comment-29644"&gt;the comments&lt;/a&gt;. Not surprisingly, commenters revealed to me some shortcomings of the survey itself–most glaringly, leaving podcasts, radio, and public libraries off the list of venues where you get your science fix. Despite these shortcomings, I still ended up thinking the survey was very useful. The picture it paints is pretty clear, and, in some ways, surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, you generously donated your time and thoughts. I am no professional market analyst, but I’ve had a delightful time poring over the survey, as well as the comments of those who did not feel satisfied by the choices I offered. It wrecked a number of assumptions I had carried into the survey, and makes me think differently about where science writing is headed from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I see in the results. (If you want to make your own interpretations in the comment thread, you can download &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/03/LOOM-SCIENCE-READER-SURVEY.pdf"&gt;the raw numbers in the survey report (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, it’s clear that &lt;strong&gt;most of you no longer get science from print newspapers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first question was, “Where do you get your science fix, and how often?” I offered some formats; the choices for each ranged from avidly down to never. Of those who responded, 58% said they rarely or never read newspapers in print. A grand total of 17 of you–2%–said you read them avidly, and 7% said you read them occasionally. The rest said you read science in print newspapers only occasionally (22%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Print magazines fared (somewhat) better in the survey&lt;/strong&gt;. 31% responded rarely or never. 55% said you read science in newspapers occasionally or frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News web sites and blogs scored big&lt;/strong&gt;. 27% read news sites avidly for science, and 40% read them frequently. Only 1% said never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogs did even better, with 50% responding with avidly and 36% frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This does not mean that you love all things digital.&lt;/strong&gt; Few of you get your science fix on TV more than occasionally; 23% said you never do so. I can’t report on podcasts, radio, and audio books, because I left them off the survey [d&amp;#39;oh!].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the biggest surprise to me was ebooks&lt;/strong&gt;. I assumed you were already riding the ebook wave. Nope. 64% of you said you never read them. Less than 2% said you read them avidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By contrast, you &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;love&lt;/span&gt; old-fashioned paper books&lt;/strong&gt;. Only 9% of you said you never bought science books.  67% of you said you bought three or more a year. About half of you subscribe to one or more print magazines for science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then asked about your digital habits in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of you (67%) still use a computer for your digital fix&lt;/strong&gt;. Only 15% use an Iphone. Only 5% use a Kindle–about the same number of you who are waiting for an Ipad to change the laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also proved to have a lot of stamina while reading on line&lt;/strong&gt;. 62% of you said you click through long features to get to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ebooks have not yet cast their spell on you&lt;/strong&gt;. 59% of you said you buy no ebooks a year because you’re waiting for them to get better; 19% said you don’t buy them because you just don’t like ebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rephrased the questions, asking about how you felt about ebooks: 70% of you said that ebooks were an interesting concept but not yet worth buying an ereader for. Another 7% said you can’t stand them. Only 3% of you have abandoned old books for the ebook future we’ve all been hearing about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few questions of the survey dealt with getting stuff for free versus paying. And here’s where &lt;strong&gt;things got  interesting in a glass-half-empty-or-half-full kind of way&lt;/strong&gt;. 40% of you said you would no longer pay for reading about science, because you can get so much for free. Only 20% of you said you’d pay to get past paywalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I described a couple possible pieces of science writing. In one case, I described an anthology of articles nicely designed in an ebook. Only 18% of you said you would &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be willing to pay for that. 29% of you said you’d pay $10. 68% of you said you’d pay a price $4 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also asked how much you’d pay for a hybrid article, with a short summary for free and an in-depth version for a payment. &lt;strong&gt;63% of you said you would be willing to pay for such an article&lt;/strong&gt;. 21% were willing to pay a buck, and 7% would pay two bucks, the highest price I put on the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science reader that emerges from this survey is very comfortable online, getting a science fix from blogs and news sites. (And judging from the comments, a fair number listen to podcasts and radio, too.) But the science reader also reads a lot of books. Books made of paper, that is, not electronic ink. That pattern may change if e-readers get better, but probably not anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical science reader will not be dropping a lot of money to get past paywalls. Some readers won’t pay anything online at all, but an appreciable fraction will pay for ebooks and individual articles–if they’re interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that this survey is utterly unscientific and downright peculiar. But if it does reflect broader trends, it means that there are opportunities for small-scale, money-making experiments in new kinds of digital genres–including ones carried out by individual writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments are well worth checking out. A couple readers challenged my approach as being hopelessly twentieth-century, demonstrating my unwillingness to accept that information is too cheap to meter now. I’ve been skeptical about the alternatives, but Morgan Wirthlin made a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/03/15/the-science-reader-help-me-draw-a-profile/#comment-29690"&gt;passionate argument to turn away from ebooks and follow the lead of musicians&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think you should consider taking your next microcosm (an /excellent/ book, by the way) and trying this model. Maybe you offer 2,000 copies of the “signature edition” on your website, which is just the normal book with your personal signature inside the cover, priced at maybe 10% above list price. Then offer 500 “subscriber editions,” which include a personalized memo and a big poster of one Carl Buell’s excellent illustrations to this hypothetical book. Finally, 50 extra special $100 “Zimmerfan editions” are sent to your most diehard readers ahead of the publication date, and include the poster, a hand-written letter of thanks, a polaroid you took, and a fossil (or even just a cool rock) you found outside. Etc., etc. It may sound ridiculous, but these are the sorts of things that people crave in the digital age. I can absolutely guarantee that you would sell out of all of these editions, and part of the reason is that your readers absolutely /want/ to support *you,* but they don’t want to feel cheated paying for something that they know they could get for free. An ‘art object’ with a personalized, cottage-industry touch is something that you cannot get for free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Scott Sigler, who started a novel-writing career by podcasting each chapter of his manuscripts, had &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/03/15/the-science-reader-help-me-draw-a-profile/#comment-29717"&gt;this to say&lt;/a&gt; in my skepticism about podcasts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carl, podcasts DO generate revenue via advertising. I run an ad on  most podcasts at scottsigler.com, and on my archived audiobooks (the  back list) I have up at podiobooks.com. It took several years to  generate a large enough audience, but now that I have it, I give away  content for free and make money  with advertising. This is nothing new —  same model radio and TV have used for decades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s all about the eyeballs (or earballs, whatever). If you create  solid, free science podcast content, and that content resonates with an  audience allowing you to consistently generate large numbers, you can  earn revenue with advertising. Yes, you can still drive traffic to a  site, and urge your listeners to buy print products, but the podcast  itself becomes the primary revenue generator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m inspired to go off to do some scheming. Meanwhile, what do you think of these results?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some don’t get the joke, or flat out don’t find it funny.  Some missed the point entirely.  And then there is the really interesting bit.  Something of a flame war is brewing between those who think it is a solidly feminist contribution and those who find it offensive and sexist, and whether or not men can (or should) properly identify sexism.  Oh, and one person who finds the idea of sexism ridiculous, because, really, we’re waaaaay past all that 1950s silliness (seriously).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the root of this argument has to do with how the various parties define feminism.  For me, it’s about freeing everyone from stereotypes and expectations tied to gender.  I’ve discussed here before my non-standard femininity and strong distaste for attempts to box me in.  Despite average differences between men and women, I think it’s crucial that we allow for outliers and eschew social pressures that stifle those who fall outside the norm.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my point of view, this comic is spot-on.  He portrays one woman’s opinion about the ridiculous &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Women-Cambridge-Womens-Pornography-Cooperative/dp/0811855511"&gt;“Porn for Women”&lt;/a&gt; books, poking fun at the idea that our culture, whether seriously or jokingly, expects women to be turned on by seeing men doing housework.  Also, the hover text punchline nod to Galactica fanfic was guffaw inducing (though my personal preference is somewhat more British and takes place in a blue police box, mostly &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who find it offensive seem to be coming from a view of feminism as something of a battle of the sexes in which women should present a unified front in the fight for equality, and in which men are the obstacle, however unwittingly, and as such can say nothing on the matter.  They are offended that a male cartoonist has dared to point out something he finds to be a rather ridiculous understanding of female sexuality.  If not that, they seem to be reading this one female character’s view on the matter as intended to apply to women universally.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I find this view hard to understand, and maybe I have it all wrong.  Maybe people on the internet just like to argue (what?!).  In any case, I thought this might be an interesting discussion to bring over to Skepchick.  Maybe you kids will have some insights that might shed some additional light on this topic. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268855751742"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=29865">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/df5300ac05d2e7a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Freakonomics podcast"/><title type="html">Freakonomics Radio: Lewis Black Fixes the Government</title><published>2010-03-17T19:30:26Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T19:30:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/L0XCbQH_cxs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/audio/freakonomics/FreakRadio3teaseFINAL.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="3168966"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/freakonomics-radio-lewis-black-fixes-the-government/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Lewis Black, the smart and wonderfully noisy comedian helps us preview the third episode of our Freakonomics Radio podcast.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~4/L0XCbQH_cxs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author><name>By STEPHEN J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bruesewitz v. Wyeth has the potential to move all that in a new direction.  The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act simply states, "No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable . . . if the injury or death resulted from side-effect that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings."

&lt;p&gt;What does that mean in plain English?  The example I've always heard used in reference to such a standard is dynamite.  Now we all know what dynamite does.  It blows up.  So, if you light a stick of dynamite, wait over it, and it blows up, you're out of luck.  By its very nature dynamite is an inherently unsafe product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you have a six-foot fuse, light it, and as you try to run away the fuse burns so quickly that you can't escape, well, you're entitled to recovery.  Or, if they use substandard chemicals and the dynamite simply blows up while sitting in a box, then you're entitled to recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still sell dynamite.  As the manufacturer you just need to sell the safest dynamite you can produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Kent Heckenlively, vaccines are like dynamite; their purpose is to explode and thereby destroy. I find it quite telling that Heckenlively couldn't think of another example to illustrate his point. I'm surprised he restrained himself not to use another similar example, such as firearms. In any case, note how he chose the example of a product designed to destroy in the context of crowing over a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/taking_a_vaccine_injury_case_to_the_supr.php"&gt;Supreme Court case&lt;/a&gt; that, in the unlikely event the plaintiffs prevail, could severely limit the power and scope of the Vaccine Court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/annals_of_im_not_anti-vaccine_part_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/I0FVYVar00o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268852575895"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/03/channel_7_doesnt_pluck_the_pig.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9e6e85dc52f04c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Channel 7 doesn't pluck the pigeons, they just lead them to slaughter</title><published>2010-03-17T19:37:39Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T19:37:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~3/_TLOAzPSSFk/channel_7_doesnt_pluck_the_pig.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2010/03/channel_7_doesnt_pluck_the_pig.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(This piece appears today at &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.org"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and is re-posted here today because I like it and I'm lazy. --PalMD)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/investigative_reporter_steve_wilson_of_w.php"&gt;a number of&lt;/a&gt; us &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/07/antivax_lies_from_a_local_repo.php"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; about an "investigative reporter" at a Detroit television station.  At the time I noted that investigative reporters serve an important role in a democracy, but that they can also do great harm, as when Channel 7's Steve Wilson parroted the talking points of the anti-vaccine movement.  Wilson has since been canned but apparently, not much has changed.  While performing my evening ablutions, I stumbled upon&lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/news/story/Hundreds-Seek-Medical-Miracles/hpPV35Ptv0aTikHVstwkfw.cspx"&gt; the latest abomination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/news/story/Hundreds-Seek-Medical-Miracles/hpPV35Ptv0aTikHVstwkfw.cspx"&gt;The story&lt;/a&gt; is about a surgeon turned faith healer.  I can think of about a half-dozen different ways to make an interesting story out of this.  But Channel 7, rather than doing the harder but more interesting story about the chicanery of faith healers, presented an infomercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Issam Nemeh claims to be a surgeon and anesthesiologist.  I don't know how much he charges for that sort of work, but he charges twenty dollars a ticket for his faith healing services.  The deceptions used by faith healers have been well-documented elsewhere but one of their methods, like all altmed folks, is to claim to have cured a self-limited condition.  One of the conditions whose improvement the reporter credited to Nemeh was optic neuritis.  The report incorrectly calls optic neuritis a form of multiple sclerosis.  Optic neuritis is a common manifestation of MS, but it is also common in isolation.  In either case, it often improves spontaneously or with medication.  Like many alternative medicine gurus, Nemeh can take advantage of the natural history of a disease by taking credit for its natural remission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he is an altmed guru, not some conventional doc with a religious streak.  In addition to his faith-healing business, Issam runs a medical practice.  The news report calls him a "certified" surgeon, anesthesiologist, and acupuncturist.  I'm not sure what that means.  He is&lt;a href="https://license.ohio.gov/default.asp"&gt; licensed to practice medicine by the state of Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.  He is not, however, certified by any board listed by&lt;a href="https://license.ohio.gov/default.asp"&gt; the American Board of Medical Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.  But a medical license lets you treat  just about anything, and according to the first hit on google, that's just what he does, offering treatment to "all patients with any type of physical, mental or emotional disorder."  This includes children.  Dr. Nemeh offers two types of treatments: "&lt;a href="http://drnemeh.com/"&gt;meridian regulatory acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;" (tranlation:  "some impossible, lucrative needle thing that suckers will pay out of pocket for") and &lt;a href="http://www.pathtofaith.com/"&gt;faith healing&lt;/a&gt; (translation: "some impossible, lucrative talky thing that suckers will pay out of pocket for").  He may be licensed to practice medicine, and Ohio may recognize acupuncture as something "medical", but in the educated opinion of this internist, what he does has nothing to do with the practice of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nemeh is a shaman.  He uses the smoke and mirrors of some sort of acupuncture machine on any condition in any patient.  This is a hallmark of quackery---claiming that one modality can treat anything, when really, it's most efficient effect is to remove money from the pockets of its victims.  But Nemeh is pretty damned cleaver.   Some folks like modern-sounding shamanism, with its needles hooked up to bells, whistles, and pretty lights.  But others prefer that old time religion, and Nemeh's got that covered with his faith heeling business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have rarely seen such an efficient combination of modern and ancient healthcare thievery (in, of course, my humble opinion).   And despite the execrable nature of TV health reporting, I have never seen such a credulous infomercial presented as news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shame on you Dr. Nemeh, and shame on you Channel 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/_TLOAzPSSFk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268852096507"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=9593">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/893862fcbf9f450e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Do “polar bears” exist?</title><published>2010-03-17T18:54:53Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T18:54:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/do-polar-bears-exist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Scientist cat" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/scientist-cat.jpg?w=204&amp;amp;h=275" alt="" width="204" height="275"&gt;Since 1996 it’s been known that, according to mitochondrial-DNA-based phylogenies, polar bears (&lt;em&gt;Ursus maritimus&lt;/em&gt;) are actually nested within brown bears (&lt;em&gt;Ursus arctos&lt;/em&gt;) rather than being a separate lineage.  In other words, the mtDNA of some populations of brown bears—in particular, those from the Admiralty, Baranof, and Chichagof (ABC) islands of southwest Alaska—is more closely related to the mtDNA of polar bears than to the mtDNA of other brown bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes brown bears “paraphyletic” with respect to polar bears.  That is, the brown bear species &lt;em&gt;U. arctos&lt;/em&gt; does not include all of the descendants of its most recent common ancestor, since some of these descendants are placed within polar bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conclusion was just confirmed by complete mtDNA sequencing of the bears. &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/11/5053.abstract?etoc"&gt;A new study in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/11/5053.abstract?etoc"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Lindqvist et al. used “fossil DNA” from a subfossil polar bear jaw to look at the evolution of polar bears &lt;em&gt;vis-à-vis &lt;/em&gt;their relatives.  The jaw, from Norway, was estimated at about 130,000-110,000 years old, and was sufficiently well preserved that a complete polar bear mtDNA genome could be extracted and sequenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sequence was compared to mtDNA sequences from two living individual polar bears and four living brown bears.  The phylogeny based on this sequence is given below.  The main result is that this jawbone came from a polar bear living about the time (estimated at 152,000 years ago) when the ancestors of modern polar bears diverged from those of brown bears.  The authors also did stable carbon-isotope analysis of a tooth from the subfossil’s jaw, and found that the isotope values for carbon-13 were close to that of modern polar bears, suggesting to the authors that the individual engaged in “marine feeding,” i.e., ate seals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below also confirms the results of earlier phylogenies, using smaller segments of mtDNA, showing that brown bears—at least these three brown bears—from the ABC islands are more closely related to polar bears than to brown bears from other places.  Again, brown bears seem to be paraphyletic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Polar bear  specimen" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/polar-bear-specimen.jpg?w=522&amp;amp;h=378" alt="" width="522" height="378"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fig. 1 (Fig. 3 of Lindqvist et al.)  A. Maximum clade probability  tree of bear mtDNA using BEAST anaysis. B.  Phylogenetic network of  complete mtDNA genomes. Note that brown bears from the “Adm” (Admiralty) and  “Baranof” populations are more closely related to polar bears (including  the subfossil specimen shown in red) than to other brown bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stable isotope data, phylogenetic analysis, and the geological and molecular age estimates of the Poolepynten specimen indicate that ancient polar bears adapted extremely rapidly both morphologically and physiologically to their current and unique ecology within only 10–30 ky following their split from a brown bear precursor and, subsequently, within the course of ~100 ky, spread to the full perimeter of the polar basin. As such, the polar bear is an excellent example of evolutionary opportunism within a widespread mammalian lineage (33). Moreover, the extreme proximity of the Poolepynten specimen to the polar bear ancestor provides a unique case of a morphologically and molecularly validated fossil link between living mammal species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is pretty interesting, but I don’t find it terribly exciting.  I think its acceptance in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; is based more on the novelty of using subfossil DNA than on any new and pentrating insight into bear evolution.  But I want to discuss the “paraphyly” of brown bears highlighted here and in previous work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this DNA-based tree really reflected the species tree, then the ancestry of the groups shows true “&lt;em&gt;species paraphyly&lt;/em&gt;“: that is, some living populations of brown bears are more closely related to living polar bears than to other living populations of brown bears.  And if that were the case, then hardcore cladists, who employ a species concept based only on “monophyly,” would not recognize the two species “brown bears” and “polar bears.”  They would have to lump them together into &lt;em&gt;a single species of bear&lt;/em&gt;.  We would no longer have polar bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, cladists aren’t rushing to do this, even though the paraphyly has  been known for 14 years.  Why not? Well, a lot of cladists aren’t  interested in “alpha taxonomy,” the practice of naming species. But anyone who’d lump polar with brown bears would also be derided.  That’s because, regardless of the genetic  ancestry of these groups, the two species now seem to be independent  evolutionary units, presumably isolated from each other by reproductive  isolating barriers such as habitat and mate preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true “species paraphyly,” how could it have come about?  How could one or a few populations of species X be more genetically related to members of species Y than to members of its own named species? Well, it’s possible that the ancestor of all polar bears came from only one geographic population of brown bears (that population represented by the ABC  localities), and so the ancestry of polar bears reflects this origin.  If gene flow were sufficiently restricted among all populations of brown bears, then the species phylogeny (which, after all, is only a formalization of evolutionary history) could reflect this localized origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably happens quite commonly, as it cannot be all that rare for a widespread species to bud off a new descendant from only one or a few of its populations. (Migration of a few individuals to an island or a distant new habitat, for example, must involve such a process.) Usually, however, gene flow among members of that big, interbreeding species would soon efface this history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all this presupposes that the mtDNA phyogeny gives us the &lt;em&gt;true species phylogeny&lt;/em&gt;—the evolutionary history of the populations themselves rather than just that of  mtDNA segments.  Does the “gene tree” of mtDNA—which, since all the DNA in a mitochondrion is physically linked, behaves as if it were a single gene—reflect the “species tree” of bears?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not.  We’ve known for a while that hybridization between species can occasionally move DNA between them, even after they’re formed, if reproductive barriers aren’t complete. And, for reasons we don’t understand, mitochondrial DNA (or chloroplast DNA) seems to move between species more easily than does nuclear DNA. If the ABC populations of brown bears exchanged, some time in the past, mitochondria with polar bears, though rare hybridization (and this is known to occur between the species), then sequencing mtDNA might tell us, erroneously, that for all genes, ABC populations are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears. And, importantly, such hybridization, which might have occurred after the polar and brown bear lineages diverged, would give us an erroneous idea of when the lineages diverged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such hybridization isn’t rare. There are lots of cases—Allen Orr and I list many of them in the appendix of our book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speciation-Jerry-Coyne/dp/0878930892"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speciation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Sinauer, 2004)—in which mitochondrial-DNA based trees give a false diagnosis of paraphyly, while nuclear DNA, consisting of lots of independent genes and not just one, shows a nonparaphyletic tree.  This is true for oak trees, birds, fruit flies, and many other species. Sometimes, as in the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; species I work on, movement of mtDNA between different species makes them seem genetically identical, while independent nuclear genes show well-demarcated species. Hybridization between species can make it very risky to use just one gene to reconstruct their history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet somehow people continue to accept mtDNA trees as equivalent to species trees.  To be sure, Lindqvist et al. formally recognize that hybridization between polar and brown bears could produce an illusory species paraphyly, although they, like earlier authors, don’t give the possibility much weight (the &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; paper gives the caveat,”Although mtDNA capture cannot be excluded to have happened between ABC bears and polar bears, these estimates nevertheless affirm with strong support a very recent divergence of polar bears from brown bears.”)  But it’s time for biologists to stop calling &lt;em&gt;species&lt;/em&gt; paraphyletic when what they mean is that &lt;em&gt;genes&lt;/em&gt; (e.g., mtDNA) are paraphyletic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine if brown bears are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; paraphyletic with respect to polar bears, and thus whether cladists would designate (brown + polar) bears as a single (very variable!) species, we’d have to look at a lot more genes—and genes from the nucleus.  If the consensus phylogeny from all these genes still shows the paraphyly, then systematists can worry about nomenclature. (But even if there were true species paraphyly, I’d still vote on retaining the two named species of bears, since I adhere to the “biological species concept” that is based not on phylogenies but the presence of reproductive barriers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, brown and polar bears are phylogenetically safe. But I wish that systematists would worry more about the problem of equating gene trees with species trees, and would stop relying solely on mitochondrial DNA when they can also use nuclear DNA. The more genes the better!&lt;/p&gt;

Given the strong links between physical inactivity and health risk (and given that we&amp;#39;re now seeing &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; diseases like heart disease and type 2 diabetes in children and teenagers), this has become a very real public health concern.  Unfortunately, when it comes to increasing childhood physical activity levels, people often want to reinvent the wheel.  For example, many people are enthralled with the Nintendo Wii as a means of increasing childhood physical activity - even though it is expensive, and the evidence supporting it is weak at best.  At the same time, evidence continues to accumulate in support of simple, inexpensive interventions for increasing childhood physical activity.  Today I&amp;#39;d like to briefly look at one of the simplest possible ways of increasing childhood physical activity levels - painting lines on a schoolyard playground....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

They were pleasant to look at in an aquarium. They seemed to show up a lot on the walls of restaurants near beaches. But as is so often the case in nature, there’s bizarre biology lurking under the surface. Specifically, inside the male seahorses. When it’s time to make new seahorses, the male seahorses get pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their pregnancy seems bizarre because it is rare. In most species that keep their young inside a parent, the job goes to the mother. But there is a deep symmetry to these two ways of reproducing. That’s a general rule when it comes to evolution: time and again, biologists find the same underlying principles driving the evolution of both the familiar and the bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The specifics of an animal’s sex life have their ultimate origin in the time and effort each sex have to put into reproducing. Very often, there’s a wild imbalance between the sexes. Just take a look at a human sperm and egg. One’s tiny and one’s big. Women may produce a few hundred viable eggs in a lifetime. Men make hundreds of new sperm a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The imbalance between the sexes means that they face different limits to how many offspring they can have. Females are not limited by a scarce supply of sperm. It would be possible, in theory, for every woman on Earth to have children fathered by a single man. Instead, what limits the reproductive success of females in many species is how many eggs they can successfully produce and rear to adulthood. Individuals that do better at that job will spread their genes over the generations. This selection drives females to put even more effort into rearing their young. Eggs can become enormous, for example–take the Kiwi bird, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/10/06/science/07bird3_ready.html"&gt;whose eggs can equal a quarter of the mother’s weight&lt;/a&gt;. Females typically put more effort into finding shelters for their young. In a number of species as varied as cockroaches and humans, females carry their young inside their body, where they can feed them and protect them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For males, the limits to reproductive success are usually very different. They don’t have to worry about nurturing their sperm, since they’re so cheap to make. Instead, in many species, they are limited by the number of females they can mate with. The fact that females spend so much time provisioning their young makes this limit even more intense. And so in many species, males compete with one another for the opportunity to mate with females. In some cases, they fight over territory where the females will show up in search of food. In other cases, they show off to females with fancy songs or feathers. In the end, some males manage to mate with more females and have more offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This arrangement gives females in some species the chance to be choosy about their mates. In many species, females will tend to mate with some males over others–in some species of fireflies, for example, the females prefer males with faster flashes over ones that flash slowly. But females face a quandary in making their choice. If they have the prospect of mating with one particular male today, who’s to say that they might not find a more attractive male tomorrow? If they fertilize their eggs with the sperm of today’s male, they won’t have the chance to upgrade later. And sometimes males make this quandary even worse, by guarding them so they can’t mate with other males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So females in many species have evolved some elaborate systems to keep their options open. Female ducks, for example, have lots of little pouches along their reproductive tract where they may be able to store sperm from different males, selecting the sperm they want to use to fertilize their eggs. Hens will squeeze out the sperm from a previous mating if they see an attractive rooster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin first recognized what he dubbed sexual selection, and in the past couple decades scientists have expanded the theory and used it to make sense of the specific details of the sex lives of particular species. Sexual selection theory is not based on some mystical essence of being male or female, however. It simply takes into consideration the costs and benefits that each sex faces in a given species. Under some conditions, the benefit that males get from competing for lots of females may be offset by the need that their young have for care. In these cases, males that help provide for their offspring after they’re born may fare better than males that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, there are some species in which both males and females provide care. And there are also some cases in which the common pattern is entirely reversed: the male does most of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the case with seahorses and their close relatives, pipefishes and seadragons.  In all of these species males undergo a sort of pregnancy. When they mate, the female transfers unfertilized eggs to the male.  The male stores the eggs, sometimes inside a fleshy pouch, where he fertilizes them with his sperm. While sperm in other animals may be heroic swimmers that can travel a female’s reproductive tract, the sperm of these fish barely move at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eggs then develop in the male. The eggs get some of their energy from the yolk their mother provided them, but the males help out too. The pouch of some species of seahorses and their relatives changes shape, taking on a very complex anatomy. Each fish embryo ends up in intimate contact with the father’s blood supply, so that he can give them nutrients. Eventually the baby fish wiggle out of dad and are ready for life on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now think about how this system can drive the evolution of the fish. The females still produce the eggs, but they don’t have to put the time and effort into rearing them. Sexual selection theory suggests that they would be better off looking for lots of males to take their eggs. And with all those females swimming around in search of males, they’re going to face some fierce competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bio.tamu.edu/FACMENU/FACULTY/JonesA.htm"&gt;Adam Jones&lt;/a&gt; of Texas A &amp;amp; M University and his colleagues have studied Gulf Pipefish to see whether this in fact occurs. (The picture above is of a male [left] and female Gulf Pipefish.) &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088911/?tool=pubmed"&gt;In one experiment&lt;/a&gt;, they found that most females failed to find any mates at all, while a small proportion of the females managed to mate with four males. Most of the males in that experiment, on the other hand, mated once. The pattern, in other words, is flipped from what you’d normally expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because males can’t mate and run, they are not limited by the number of females they can fertilize. As a result, there’s less of a benefit to making lots of sperm. And that explains the remarkably scant supply of sperm these fish produce. Instead of making millions of sperm every day, a male seahorse’s testes may carry just 150 sperm in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition of females opens up the opportunity for males to be picky, rather than the females. And Jones and other scientists have found that, indeed, the females that mate the most have certain traits in common. They tend to be bigger than other females, and they have fancier fins and brighter color patterns. It’s no surprise, then, that female Gulf Pipefish females are bigger than males.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do the males go for the big flashy females? Today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, Jones and his colleagues &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature08861"&gt;have published an experiment that offers some answers.&lt;/a&gt; Big females transfer more eggs into the pouches of males than small females. And the bigger the female, the more likely each egg was to survive. By being picky, males can have more kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reversal does not stop there. Jones and his colleagues wondered if males controlled the amount of investment they put into rearing eggs from different females. They had males mate one female, and then another. They discovered that the survival of the second brood depended on the first. If the first brood came from a big female, fewer of the eggs from the second brood survived. The opposite also held true. Jones and his colleagues concluded that the males are likely giving more resources to the eggs from big females, leaving less for small females they might later encounter. And they do end up mating with smaller females, they give the eggs fewer resources, so that they’re in a better position should they encounter a big female next time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had left seahorses and their kin out of the sex chapter in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981519474?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0981519474"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tangled Bank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but when it comes time to update it, they will definitely be making a cameo appearance. Their mirror-image sex life has turned out to be just too amazing to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

Go read it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If general public will not actively seek science content ('pull') than perhaps we can have the content come to them wherever they are ('push'). But people are scattered over gazillions of media places! How do we get to them everywhere? One answer is to try to get many people to contribute science-y stories everywhere (or, as I &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2010/0315/As-Climate-Change-debate-wages-on-scientists-turn-to-Hollywood-for-help" title=""&gt;said before&lt;/a&gt;, we don't need one Carl Sagan, we need hundreds.... or thousands of them, each in a different media spot). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the other important factor, and this is something that Danielle points out and I did not think of clearly before, is that the general population is not homogenous. There are groups that are not scattered all over the fragmented media but flock to specific media outlets that cater to them - media outlets they tend to own or run or work at or write for or have influence on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danielle goes into detail about the media consumption of the African American community, but her thoughts apply to other groups as well, e.g., Latinos, or gays, etc. This may also apply to various blogospheres, e.g., mommybloggers, atheist bloggers, feminist bloggers - all groups with strong group identity, congregating at a relatively limited number of media outlets on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that Danielle noted is that media outlets that target African Americans prefer if the science stories are "Africo-Americanized", i.e., that they specifically hook the audience with something that is directly relevant to that community (and supposedly no other community). Why? Cool science stories are &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/the_value_of_this_is_cool_science_stories.php" title=""&gt;cool for everyone&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect that this was more editor-think than the actual response of the audience to Danielle's science articles that were cool without being 'Africo-Americanized'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some of the communities are more inclined to be interested in science than others, especially those communities that see themselves as 'reality-based', thus inherently science-friendly. Thus progressive blogs like DailyKos have regular science coverage both on the main page and in the diaries - cool science stories, as well as science/political controversial topics. Atheist blogs are sometimes indistinguishable from science blogs. Feminist bloggers, like &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/blogs/Focal-Point" title=""&gt;Lindsay Beyerstein&lt;/a&gt;, Jesse and Amanda at &lt;a href="http://pandagon.net/" title=""&gt;Pandagon&lt;/a&gt; and some of the community bloggers at &lt;a href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Shakesville&lt;/a&gt; regularly touch on science topics (especially those with either public health concerns, or environmental concerns, or with political controversies associated with them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we get science stories, purely cool or group-targeted, in front of other audiences, e.g., those based on race/ethnicity, or gender/orientation? Are whites much more scattered across the media than minorities or do they also congregate around their various interests? Where do they congregate? How do we 'push' science there where they are? Not just online, but also in big corporate media, especially television?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/push_vs_pull_strategies_in_sci.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/dunCO2rD2-8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268847853689"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/steve-spike-finchs-zen-tambour-drums-tuned-steel-drums.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9026adae71766286</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stories about My Relatives"/><title type="html">Steve "Spike" Finch's Zen Tambour Drums (Tuned Steel Drums)</title><published>2010-03-17T16:33:42Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T16:33:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2010/03/steve-spike-finchs-zen-tambour-drums-tuned-steel-drums.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;DrummerMan got one for his birthday last month.  According to his wife, he&amp;#39;s obsessed with it:&lt;/p&gt;

What I'm doing undercuts their faith at the most fundamental level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so first we must make them liberals, then agnostics and then atheists. If we attempt to argue them from Christianity to atheism in one fell swoop we will not do it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7053788226267871043?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Initially, I was working on a book made up of a collection of material from blog posts;
along the way, I got diverted, and ended up writing a book about cloud computing using
Google's AppEngine tools. The book isn't finished, but my publisher, the Pragmatic Programmers,
have a program that they call &lt;em&gt;beta books&lt;/em&gt;. Once a book is roughly 60% done, you 
can buy it at a discount, and download drafts electronically immediately. As more sections
get done, you can download each new version. And when the book is finally finished, you
get a final copy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We released the first beta version of the book today. You can look at 
excerpts, or buy a copy, by going to
&lt;a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mcappe/code-in-the-cloud"&gt;the books page&lt;/a&gt;
at Pragmatic's website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If you're interested in what cloud computing is, and how to build cloud applications - or if
you just feel like doing something to support you friendly local math-blogger - please take
a look, and consider getting a copy. I'm not going to harp about the book a lot on the blog; you're
not going to see a ton of posts that are thinly veiled advertisements, or updates tracking 
sales, or anything like that. If there's something that I would have written about anyway,
and it's appropriate to mention the book, then I'll feel free to mention it, but I won't
waste your time hyping it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In other news, here's the main reason that things have been dead on this blog since
the weekend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/upload/2010/03/code_in_the_cloud_my_book_beta/photo.jpeg" width="720" height="481" alt="photo.jpeg"&gt;


&lt;p&gt; That's the view from my driveway as of monday morning. Over the weekend,
we had one of the worst windstorms to hit New York in about thirty years. That
mess is two oak trees, each close to 2 meters in diameter, which came down on
our street on saturday. (If you look closely towards the right hand side, you
can see the remains of my neighbors car.) The telephone pole in the picture
was snapped not by getting hit by a tree, but simply by the wind. Since that
pole had our electrical transformer, and those trees took out the wiring that
fed that transformer, we are (obviously) without electricity, internet, or
(most importantly) heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Con-ed is promising to restore our electricity by friday. I'm not holding my
breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Anyway, back to the happy stuff. The book exists in electronic form! Buy
a copy for yourself, your friends, your neighbors, and your dog! We've got lots
of wonderful new expenses to deal with recovering from that storm! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shocker, I know. &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;I’ve written on this topic extensively&lt;/a&gt;, but of course astrologers send me email — seriously — saying how their flavor of magic works, or that I wasn’t fair, or that if only I faced the right way and triantrilated my fibbertygibbet, astrology would be correct, despite my article very carefully showing that no matter how you slice it, astrology doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, astrology’s horse isn’t quite dead yet, so beating it isn’t such a bad idea. My friend Moriel Schottlender wrote up &lt;a href="http://www.smarterthanthat.com/astronomy/astrology-a-practical-test-objects-that-affect-you-at-birth/"&gt;a nice dissection of astrology&lt;/a&gt; walking through the steps showing (despite many astrologers’ claims) that gravity clearly is not the force behind astrology. She even includes math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, those of us in the reality-based Universe knew this, since when tested properly astrology fails tests devised even by astrologers themselves (see my article linked above). So there is no force behind astrology, except that of the human mind to fool itself. Because of that, we’ll always be debunking bunk like this. I guess that’s one thing astronomers and astrologers really do have in common: there will always be work for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The host of American Public Media’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/index.shtml"&gt;Speaking of Faith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Krista Tippett&lt;/strong&gt;, believes we can.  She calls them both “pursuits of cohesive knowledge and underlying truths” and does not believe they are necessarily in opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Clearly, a view everyone reading this shares…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143116770/ref=s9_simv_bw_p14_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;pf_rd_s=center-7&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=0PFB8TQKNEZMCYFDBQ98&amp;amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=490891951&amp;amp;pf_rd_i=283155"&gt;Einstein’s God: Conversations About Science and the Human Spirit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Tippett speaks to a number of scientists, theologians, Templeton prize winners (what category are they in?), and artists about these issues and shows how (&lt;a href="http://graywave.blogspot.com/2010/03/review-einsteins-god-by-krista-tippett.html"&gt;as one blogger put it&lt;/a&gt;) “scientists and theologians are asking the same questions of and feeling the same wonder at the world they inhabit, without conflict, and with great humility and respect for the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure some of you are offended by that very notion — that science is placed on the same mantle as religion.  Hell, I’m sure some religious people are offended by that idea, too.  &lt;strong&gt;Massimo Pigliucci&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2010/03/krista-tippett-does-it-again.html"&gt;doesn’t hide his distaste for the book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before discussing whether this is intellectually honest or not — is it just a big fluff piece? — below is an extended excerpt from Tippett’s book in which she speaks with &lt;strong&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/strong&gt;’s biographer &lt;strong&gt;James Moore&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Charles Darwin published &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; in 1859. We’ve come to imagine him as a godless naturalist and to see the publication of his book as a dramatic moment in history, one that has created an instantaneous rift between science and religion. These assumptions fuel some of our most intractable cultural debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my conversation with the biographer James Moore, we reject those debates. We explore the world in which Darwin formulated his ideas. We read from his varied writings. We ask what Darwin himself believed. Did he find his observations of the natural world a rejection of God and of creation? How might he speak to our present struggles over his legacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Darwin was grounded in the distinctly reverent Judeo-Christian philosophy of Western science up to that point in history, a view of the world encapsulated in a quote of Francis Bacon that he put opposite the title page of &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let no man… think or maintain that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of God’s word, or in the book of God’s works… but rather let men endeavor an endless progress or proficience in both.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin, as we learn from James Moore, was agonizingly aware of the fixed worldview that his theory of transmutation — the original term for evolution — would unsettle. The people of Darwin’s time believed that every condition of plant, animal, and man was static and eternal, brought into being all at once at the beginning of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They estimated that to have been six thousand years earlier. But &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; was not the first classic scientific text to break from such beliefs. It was, rather, the last to fully engage them. Darwin waited two decades before he published. His observations and conclusions were painstakingly belabored. He anticipated religious questions and objections at every turn and responded carefully to them. Darwin’s theory of natural selection was born, James Moore asserts, of “theological humility.” This insight alone would place our culture’s contentious battles over Darwin on a different footing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own suppositions have been radically changed by this discussion. I’m reminded of the conversations I had on Albert Einstein. Einstein did not reject the idea of a force or “mind” behind the universe. But he saw that expressed in natural laws that could be discerned and described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, Darwin saw creation as an unfolding reality. Once set in motion, as he saw it, the laws of nature sustained a self-organizing progression driven by the needs and struggles of every aspect of creation itself. The word “reverence” would not be too strong to describe the attitude with which Darwin approached all he saw in the natural world. There is a great intellectual and spiritual passion and a touching sense of wonder evident in his writings, from his private notebooks and correspondence to the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; diary and &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;. For me, this view from within Darwin’s life and times opens up fascinating new ways to ponder not the rift but the possibilities for exchange between science and theology. He used the biblically evocative analogy of a “tree of life” to illustrate his theory of species sprouting as branches from the same trunk, some flourishing and others withering and falling to nourish the ground in which the whole is sustained. His vision of all of life netted together is profoundly consonant with what we are learning now in environmental sciences as well as in genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In describing a creation that organized itself, incorporating chaos and change into survival and progress, Darwin did not challenge the idea of God as the source of all being. But he did reject the idea of a God minutely implicated in every flaw and injustice and catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As James Moore puts it, Darwin forced human beings to look at the inherent struggle of natural life head-on, not as we wish it to be, but as it is in all its complexity and brutality and mystery. This is the most difficult for human beings, perhaps, in times of great change and turmoil such as ours. Indeed Moore and I trace the fact that the greatest resistance to Darwin’s ideas has appeared in other cultural moments of flux and global danger. But Moore tells his students who believe they must choose between belief in a creator and the science of Darwin simply to read &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;. There is much in Darwin’s thought that would ennoble as well as ground a religious view of life and of God. I’ll end with that book’s final lines, which are rich with wonder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[F]rom the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals directly follows. There is grandeur in the view of life with it several powers, having been originally breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/03/planckdustbig.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/03/planckdustsmall.jpg" alt="planckdustsmall" title="planckdustsmall" width="500" height="444"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a false-color image, of course; the dust is very cold (tens of degrees above absolute zero), and the image is constructed from microwaves, not from visible light.  You can see the plane of the galaxy, and the filamentary structures arising from all the churning of the interstellar medium from supernovae, star formation, magnetic fields, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, pretty time is over.

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/y1cL0TZ6dWA&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

I recently had the opportunity to attend The Amaz!ng Adventure 5.  While at Grand Turks, our final port, I was wandering through the  duty-free shop looking for deals on liquor (Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel  for $39!) when I happened upon a tableful of woo. Seeing as I was a  medical student on a skeptical cruise, I had to stop and have my wife  help make &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1cL0TZ6dWA"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my off-the-cuff video, I didn’t have the opportunity to  mention the lack of scientific evidence for their claims. Even if the  magnetic field did penetrate the skin, it still would not stimulate  blood flow because the amount of iron in blood is far too small.  If blood did have a strong magnetic attraction, your body would explode  in an MRI (which would be cool, I admit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t have time to discuss the clinical trials that have been  performed to evaluate efficacy. As usual with CAM research,  earlier poor quality studies were weakly positive (1,2), while more  recent high quality studies and meta-analyses are definitively negative  (3,4,5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also forgot to mention the numerous court rulings in the late ‘90s  and early ‘00s against companies making false claims about  these products. This issue is discussed extensively on Quackwatch for  those interested (6). In a nutshell, companies that fraudulently claimed  to treat specific illnesses (arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, migraines,  etc.) were sued. Now, they use nebulous phrases such as “support the  healing process” or “restore natural energy.” You know, phrases that  have not been evaluated by the Federal Drug Administration and are not  designed to diagnose, treat or blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, magnet therapy is a great case study of CAM. The lack of  scientific plausibility, the progression of the medical literature, and  the FDA Miranda Rights statement are all characteristic of CAM. And if a  lowly medical student can debunk it is less than a minute, how good can  it really be?&lt;/p&gt;

The shortest connection is to the parents of my grandmother. My great-grandfather was Thomas (Keys) Foster, born in County &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Tyrone"&gt;Tyrone&lt;/a&gt; on September 5, 1852. He immigrated to Canada in 1876. Thomas married Eliza Ann Job, born in Fintona, County Tyrone on August 18, 1852. She immigrated to Canada in 1877.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas and Eliza settled in Saskatchewan in 1883 and that's where my grandmother was born. Other ancestors in this line came from the adjacent counties of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Donegal"&gt;Donegal&lt;/a&gt; (surname Foster) and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Fermanagh"&gt;Fermanagh&lt;/a&gt; (surnames Keys, Emerson, Moore) and possibly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Londonderry"&gt;Londonderry&lt;/a&gt; (surname Job).   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S6D2PVITf8I/AAAAAAAAKfU/m9X1-oU2dpI/s1600-h/tmp.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:304px;height:400px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DZH2cmCoois/S6D2PVITf8I/AAAAAAAAKfU/m9X1-oU2dpI/s400/tmp.bmp" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/happy-st-patricks-day.html"&gt;Happy St. Patrick's Day (2009)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/03/happy-st-patricks-day.html"&gt;Happy St. Patrick's Day (2008)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2007/03/happy-st-patricks-day.html"&gt;Happy St. Patrick's Day (2007)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/10/niall-nigiallach-niall-of-nine-hostages.html"&gt;Niall Nóigiallach - Niall of the Nine Hostages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-4884086598030214408?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268841190760"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_21.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9008b24503b696c7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Scio10 Interviews"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline2010 - interview with Mary Jane Gore</title><published>2010-03-17T16:47:17Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T16:47:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Cdnv2knzC4E/scienceonline2010_-_interview_21.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_21.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuing with the tradition from last two years, I will occasionally post interviews with some of the participants of the &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline2010&lt;/a&gt; conference that was held in the Research Triangle Park, NC back in January. See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Mary Gore from &lt;a href="http://www.dukemedicine.org/news_and_publications/news_office/index" title=""&gt;The Duke Medicine Office of News and Communications&lt;/a&gt; to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a science writer at Duke University Medical Center, which is a great vantage point over many fields of learning. I was a science major, biology at University of Virginia, who always wanted a career as a writer. So going to journalism grad school at the University of Missouri provided the professional direction I needed. Between colleges, I worked three years at National Geographic writing for their image collection and working for their children's magazine, then called World. Since the journalism degree, I've had editorial jobs, and I also freelanced 11 years, before moving into academia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oooh! I loved 'NG World' when I was a kid - a family friend in the USA bought me a subscription and I read every issue many times through. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm so fortunate to have landed at a Top 10 medical school where the scientists within the various schools are so collaborative and supportive of each other's work, by and large. That makes for interesting work of all sorts. What become the biggest stories, for me as a science writer, aren't always the most predictable topics: diet and sex, for instance. In the two years I have been at Duke, the biggest story (and one I still get emails about) was Bryan Cullen's RNA findings involving the virus that causes cold sores. The popularity of that story - a very basic science finding - was because of the sheer numbers: nearly 90 percent of people get the darn things, and any hope for a cure - even in the future - is news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mary Gore pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Mary%20Gore%20pic.jpg" width="448" height="336" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked as a medical writer most of my professional career, but as an 11-year freelancer I took on a lot of assignments. I even had scripts produced for a TV show (Divorce Court). Writing about divorce was a fictional activity back then - and now you can't make this stuff up. It's what we have to compete with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time is mainly spent in publicizing basic or translational biomedical science. My passion is to do my part to make the world understand that science is more important than celebrity. I am not so starry-eyed as to think that science will catch celebrity in the headline-making arena - but I do hope to see more medical and biomedical science in more places where people get their news. I sincerely believe that informing the public as much as I - and as we - can about early and late-stage research is going to help save the planet. I have two kids, so it's important to me to discuss the issues. Not that he went out of his way to be my Facebook friend, but there I can see he has a bit of the awareness I was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always trying to learn better ways to reach the broadest audience with one story. It's interesting to try different tactics with different stories. One week it may be science websites and blogs that pick up the story - in fact, that happens most weeks. In other conditions, it may be the mainstream media, but there nearly always has to be either a translational component or a dangerous disease/condition for which there may be a promising, though early, finding. Even great science stories disappear when there are predominant stories, like the Haiti Earthquake, health care reform near-passage, the presidential election. The growing number of outlets online is pleasing.  But my question is: who can synthesize all of these stories and make sense of it? Which sites are really the best go-to sites? For example, where are we, really, in the fight against cancer? There are thousands of bits of information. It feels hard to keep up, to know the best places to go for each subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I am not a blogger at all. I do read them - yours comes to my inbox, but it is one of the few I subscribe to, because of time constraints I feel. Now that so many MSM science writers are gone from their posts, I think blogs will be further enriched. Maybe I'll subscribe to more. I think we all have inbox fatigue.  I have helped Duke scientists write about their findings for Huffington Post, and that is something I am proud of, given the potential readership by influential readers of those blogs who may be looking for sound information. I think blogging science news is a net positive. People need to learn about scientific findings - reported with accuracy - in any way they can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline2010.com/index.php/wiki/Participants_Blogroll/" title=""&gt;science blogs by the participants&lt;/a&gt; at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn't much of a blog reader until I came to Duke two years ago, and, in a nicely old-fashioned way, was introduced to you at &lt;a href="http://www.mistersugar.com/" title=""&gt;Anton Zuiker'&lt;/a&gt;s home. That is really old-school - getting a personal introduction to the blogger - and in fact, that is what happens at Science Online '10 - isn't it? We all can meet in person and share. I like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/" title=""&gt;Ed Yong'&lt;/a&gt;s approach, and &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/" title=""&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;, and I like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/" title=""&gt;Neurophilosophy&lt;/a&gt;. I have been reading &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;, and not just for the animal sex posts -- I read him before that. I like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/culturedish/" title=""&gt;Rebecca Skloot&lt;/a&gt;, too, and &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/" title=""&gt;XX Factor&lt;/a&gt; on Slate. Oh, and Sandra Tsing Loh, the &lt;a href="http://lohdown.caltech.edu/" title=""&gt;Loh Down on Science&lt;/a&gt; (a radio show, not a blog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you? Any suggestions for next year? Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very democratic meeting; the accessibility to all others, including the gracious speakers, is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Journalism session was the standout for me - it hurt to realize that the information we give as PIOs is considered so specious to some other writers. Thank you for your recent defense of PIOs as a source of science writing. We each have a communication job to do. Mine is to publicize the works, large and small of the scientists at Duke in biomedical fields.  But as a trained journalist and one who freelanced as a writer for 11 years before going into full-time work in academia, I do strive to provide accurate science stories, double-check statistics and other data, and include thoughtful quotes from the scientists. Maybe part of my personal mission is to get young people interested in science, too, with bright, encouraging, affirming quotes from those who are practicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to see you again and thank you for the interview. I hope you come again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_-_interview_21.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Cdnv2knzC4E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268840473915"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4209">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/47e1c6fee310c5a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">How bad can health reporting get?</title><published>2010-03-17T07:00:22Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T07:00:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4209" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/investigative_reporter_steve_wilson_of_w.php"&gt;a number of&lt;/a&gt; us &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/07/antivax_lies_from_a_local_repo.php"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; about an “investigative reporter” at a Detroit television station.  At the time I noted that investigative reporters serve an important role in a democracy, but that they can also do great harm, as when Channel 7’s Steve Wilson parroted the talking points of the anti-vaccine movement.  Wilson has since been canned but apparently, not much has changed.  While performing my evening ablutions, I stumbled upon&lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/news/story/Hundreds-Seek-Medical-Miracles/hpPV35Ptv0aTikHVstwkfw.cspx"&gt; the latest abomination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/news/story/Hundreds-Seek-Medical-Miracles/hpPV35Ptv0aTikHVstwkfw.cspx"&gt;The story&lt;/a&gt; is about a surgeon turned faith healer.  I can think of about a half-dozen different ways to make an interesting story out of this.  But Channel 7, rather than doing the harder but more interesting story about the chicanery of faith healers, presented an infomercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Issam Nemeh claims to be a surgeon and anesthesiologist.  I don’t know how much he charges for that sort of work, but he charges twenty dollars a ticket for his faith healing services.  The deceptions used by faith healers have been well-documented elsewhere but one of their methods, like all altmed folks, is to claim to have cured a self-limited condition.  One of the conditions whose improvement the reporter credited to Nemeh was optic neuritis.  The report incorrectly calls optic neuritis a form of multiple sclerosis.  Optic neuritis is a common manifestation of MS, but it is also common in isolation.  In either case, it often improves spontaneously or with medication.  Like many alternative medicine gurus, Nemeh can take advantage of the natural history of a disease by taking credit for its natural remission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he is an altmed guru, not some conventional doc with a religious streak.  In addition to his faith-healing business, Issam runs a medical practice.  The news report calls him a “certified” surgeon, anesthesiologist, and acupuncturist.  I’m not sure what that means.  He is&lt;a href="https://license.ohio.gov/default.asp"&gt; licensed to practice medicine by the state of Ohio&lt;/a&gt;.  He is not, however, certified by any board listed by&lt;a href="https://license.ohio.gov/default.asp"&gt; the American Board of Medical Specialties&lt;/a&gt;.  But a medical license lets you treat  just about anything, and according to the first hit on google, that’s just what he does, offering treatment to “all patients with any type of physical, mental or emotional disorder.”  This includes children.  Dr. Nemeh offers two types of treatments: “&lt;a href="http://drnemeh.com/"&gt;meridian regulatory acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;” (tranlation:  ”some impossible, lucrative needle thing that suckers will pay out of pocket for”) and &lt;a href="http://www.pathtofaith.com/"&gt;faith healing&lt;/a&gt; (translation: “some impossible, lucrative talky thing that suckers will pay out of pocket for”).  He may be licensed to practice medicine, and Ohio may recognize acupuncture as something “medical”, but in the educated opinion of this internist, what he does has nothing to do with the practice of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nemeh is a shaman.  He uses the smoke and mirrors of some sort of acupuncture machine on any condition in any patient.  This is a hallmark of quackery—claiming that one modality can treat anything, when really, it’s most efficient effect is to remove money from the pockets of its victims.  But Nemeh is pretty damned cleaver.   Some folks like modern-sounding shamanism, with its needles hooked up to bells, whistles, and pretty lights.  But others prefer that old time religion, and Nemeh’s got that covered with his faith heeling business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have rarely seen such an efficient combination of modern and ancient healthcare thievery (in, of course, my humble opinion).   And despite the execrable nature of TV health reporting, I have never seen such a credulous infomercial presented as news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame on you Dr. Nemeh, and shame on you Channel 7.&lt;/p&gt;

Oxytocin does a lot of things in the body, but what this paper was interested in was its participation in social bonding. You all must already know the coolest story about oxytocin, the story about the two species of voles. The species are almost identical. One species mates for life, one doesn’t. The one that does has more receptors in its brain for oxytocin than the one that doesn’t.[2]Because of the promise of learning more about oxytocin, I chose this paper for my second and final journal club presentation. The second time is a lot less scary than the first, I learned, and preparation goes faster.This paper took a while to get to oxytocin, so let me start at the beginning. The authors had run three separate experiments which the paper covered. In the first study,  Assessment of wound healing due to Nestlet treatment, they gave some rats a burn on their backs. (It was a pretty serious burn; two of the rat pups died of shock after receiving it.) Then they put them into three groups. One group of rats lived in sets of three (“group housed”). One group of rats lived alone (“isolation housed”). And one group of rats lived alone, but were given Nestlets, which are little cotton squares which can be used to make nests. They compared the healing rates of the three groups. The group housed rats healed the fastest; the isolation housed rats which had Nestlets to use to make nests healed almost as fast (statistically there was no significant difference); and the isolation housed rats without Nestlets healed most slowly.They asked themselves: why does nest making help rats heal better? It seems like the mechanism has to be central (in the brain, rather than in the rest of the body), since a nest is really environmental enrichment. In their second experiment, Time series analysis of wound healing and comparison of wound healing with Nestlets to wound healing with oxytocin,  they repeated their first experiment, but this time with a fourth group of rats: isolation housed rats who were injected with oxytocin once a day for several weeks. Why oxytocin? The idea seemed to be that rats build nests together, and if a rat lives alone, building a nest is still somehow a social act. Since oxytocin is released during social bonding, a dose of oxytocin might theoretically substitute for having other rats around or for nest building. And indeed, the rats given oxytocin healed faster, with rates similar to the rates of rats given Nestlets.Finally, in Assessment of behavior and brain changes due to Nestlet administration, they had four groups of rats: group housed rats without Nestlets; group housed rats with Nestlets; isolation housed rats with Nestlets; isolation housed rats without Nestlets. No rats were burned in this experiment. They demonstrated gene expression changes (mRNA changes) in the brains of rats given Nestlets, and demonstrated behavior changes (decreased hyperactivity in an “open field test”).They conclude by suggesting that Nestlets do affect wound healing rates; these changes seem to happen because of changes in the brain (though that isn’t proven); and this particular model of wound healing and Nestlet administration might be a good model for studying stress impairment of physical health in humans.I had gone into this paper enthusiastically, because oxytocin is probably my favorite hormone. I came out the other end bothered on several levels, but decided to present the paper at journal club anyways, because it seemed like a good exercise. The attendees seemed as bothered by the paper as I was, and contributed more issues with it than those I’d come up with; actually, the presentation felt really enjoyable to me as a result.What bothered me? To start, why were the rats not given any analgesics at all? Perhaps the researchers felt that pain killers would have confounded their study design in some way, but I would have been interested to know what way. As it stood, I wondered if they simply hadn’t thought of it.Can you really say that the effects of nest making are centrally mediated (take place in the brain) just because they are similar to the effects of oxytocin? Can you even say that the effects of nest making are related to the effects of social interactions? No, you cannot. Perhaps the tool used here for measuring rate changes in wound healing was so insensitive that any number of changes would look similar. Perhaps the changes were in fact very similar but caused by very different things. (One possibility proposed by someone at journal club: the rats which were able to nest improved because the nests helped them keep warm better, something which group housed rats use each other to do.) To their credit, the authors of this paper did state that they hadn’t proven that the effects of Nestlets were centrally mediated or even related to the effects of oxytocin administration. But if they knew that their study wasn’t going to answer that question, why include the oxytocin group at all? Or, if they really were interested in comparing the two mechanisms, why not include an oxytocin group in the experiment in which they looked at behavior changes and mRNA changes in the brain?The studies certainly did demonstrate that oxytocin administration improves wound healing in isolation reared rats. But does this have to do with the fact that oxytocin is associated with bonding? It might have been interesting to see if oxytocin administration improved wound healing in group housed rats as well.The studies also demonstrated that providing Nestlets does improve healing rates in isolation housed rats. However, one rat researcher at journal club pointed out that, in fact, they couldn’t even say that “nest building” caused the improvement. Perhaps it was just the exercise of moving the Nestlets around the cage. She suggested a control group which was given exercise wheels.The suggestion that this model could be useful to study the physical effects of stress in humans gave me pause, as well. Different kinds of stress have different effects. This kind of social isolation stress isn’t necessarily going to affect a human the same way some other kind of stress might, like job-related stress. In fact, one journal club attendee pointed out that the slower wound healing rates in the isolation housed rats might have less to do with social isolation stress, and more to do with the fact that group housed rats are able to lick each other’s wounds. (None of us knew if rats actually did that, though.)As a veterinary student, I was also a little saddened by the fact that this paper was never placed by its authors into the context of laboratory animal medicine. Though the purpose of the paper was to illustrate a model that is useful for human medicine, I felt at least a sentence could have been devoted to explaining the context of enrichment for laboratory animals and why it is important.At the end of the paper, the authors explained some future directions for their research, including giving oxytocin antagonists to rats with Nestlets. This would prevent oxytocin from acting in those rats. If the effects of the Nestlets were blocked in those rats (i.e., if their wound healing slowed), then we might conclude that oxytocin had something to do with the mechanism of Nestlets’ effects. That would be an interesting next step and would definitely clarify the Nestlet/oxytocin relationship, if there is one. I wish that they had waited to publish this paper until they could include those findings; as it is, the paper felt somewhat incomplete.We talked a little bit about the journal that this paper was published in: PLoS ONE, an open access journal. One attendee felt that open access journals are likely to publish lower quality papers. I hope that’s not actually true, since I believe open access to be important. If this paper weren’t open access, I wouldn’t be able to provide a link to its full text in this blog post!Of course, the paper did have some interesting things to say. Nest making improves wound healing in socially isolated rats. That’s interesting! (But we don’t really have any idea why it does this, at least not based on this paper.) Oxytocin also improves wound healing in socially isolated rats, which I find even more interesting. I’m curious whether oxytocin has been used in wound healing experiments in the past. I know that research has suggested in the past that happily bonded people are healthier (though I don’t know anything about this field and therefore hesitate to try to find a reference for this assertion — if you have a good one, let us know in the comments). I’ve always wondered why. Do people living alone find taking care of themselves harder? They might be more likely to have trouble getting to the hospital, or lack caretakers when they’re ill, or just lack someone to tell them “You’re sick, go to bed.” This study suggests that loneliness might actually affect health more directly. Of course, the complete social isolation these rats experienced might have different effects from the milder isolation of someone who lives alone but works in an office. And healing from burn wounds is not the same thing as general health. It’s still food for thought.I was definitely dissatisfied with this paper, but the presentation was fun. The attendees felt engaged and interested. I hadn’t realized before how useful it can be to present a paper that you have som...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Here, the larger question I'd like to consider is how peer review -- the back and forth between authors and reviewers, mediated (and perhaps even refereed by) journal editors -- does, could, and perhaps should play out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prefacing his post about the paper, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/science_blogs_and_public_engag.php"&gt;Bora writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, let me get the Conflict Of Interest out of the way. I am on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Science Communication. I helped the journal find reviewers for this particular manuscript. And I have reviewed it myself. Wanting to see this journal be the best it can be, I was somewhat dismayed that the paper was published despite not being revised in any way that reflects a response to any of my criticisms I voiced in my review.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Bora's post, in other words, drew heavily on comments he wrote for the author of the paper to consider (and, presumably, to take into account in her revision of the manuscript) &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it was published.

&lt;p&gt;Since, as it turns out, the author &lt;em&gt;didn't&lt;/em&gt; make revisions addressing Bora's criticisms that ended up in the published version of the paper, Bora went ahead and made those criticisms part of the (now public) discussion of the published paper.  He still endorses those criticisms, so he chooses to share them with the larger audience the paper has now that it has been published.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Science online talks between generations&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/blugger" title=""&gt;Beatrice Lugger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/PM_09_Nobel_Laureate_Meeting_2009__Follow_the_Proceedings_Online.AxCMS" title=""&gt;Christian Rapp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: In huge meetings around the world several organizations try to initiate a dialogue between top scientists and young researchers -the &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de"&gt;Lindau Meetings of Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; are one of them providing numerous opportunities for an exchange of ideas and thoughts between young researchers and Nobel Laureates. The idea is to support this dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. We'd like to discuss how one can initiate a continued communication process even between two meetings. Which internet/social web tools might be useful to bridge the communication habits of a younger generation with that of an older generation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is if one can organize such a dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get some impressions of the Lindau Nobel Laureates meeting itself please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/WebHome.AxCMS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, click through the archives, read in the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/MeetingReports.AxCMS"&gt;annual reports&lt;/a&gt; and take a look at the actual list of &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de/PublicParticipants.AxCMS?Meeting=278&amp;amp;Usergroup=6742"&gt;Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; who are expected to join the next meeting (the participation list of young researchers will be online by the end of April 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to promote the scientific communication between generations. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/video/lindau2009/index.html"&gt;Five short films&lt;/a&gt; presented by Nature Video, show some kinds of such a dialogue. Join Laureates and young researchers as they discuss the future of medicine, consider the ethics of nanotechnologies, plan new collaborations, and seek ways to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely there also exists a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/2009/06/exemplifying-apprenticeship-the-lindau-meetings.php"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting and we are acitve on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/LindauNobelLaureatesMeeting"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lindaunobel"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Till now the traffic on these plattforms abruptly drops down after the meetings and grows up some weeks before the next one. We'd like to find new ways to encourage a continuous dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/scienceonline2010_talks_betwee_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Ds-Lzc0MmQw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268834684681"><id gr:original-id="http://blog.openhelix.eu/?p=3790">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f689d8bce7803db9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Tip of the Week: Word Add-In for Ontology Recognition</title><published>2010-03-17T09:07:34Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T09:07:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/OtzGMzPkKwI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.openhelix.eu/?p=3790"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">In today’s tip I want to make you aware of a tool that I think will help researchers to present their own data and publications in an accurate and universally searchable way. I learned of the resource (UCSDBioLit) through an article in one of my recent BioMed Central article alert emails. This resource allows authors to mark-up their own publications with XML tags AS THEY WRITE their papers. This will allow faster and more accurate semantic searching of their research.

A huge problem in science today is the ability to quickly search the vast literature base and to accurately and efficiently find the data that you are interested in. Here at OpenHelix we focus on ways of effectively and efficiently get information out of public databases and resources, but at the other end of the process is the ability for scientific knowledge to be curated into those resources. We have featured biocurators and the phenomenal work that they do several times in the past, but it is work that never ends and can be very labor intensive. It often involves an initial triaging of a field’s literature, some level of automatic information gathering, and then careful manual effort on the part of scientist at the resource to gather and present the information through their site. I know from personal experience that the process of reading a paper, clarifying research details with an author, and then presenting that information to the author’s satisfaction can be a very long &amp;amp; labor intensive process, for both the curator AND the original author.

For years there has been discussion of ‘expert curation’ in which experts in the field author review or summary pages in a resource, or community curation jamborees, etc. And there have been fruits from many of these efforts, but in general participation is low. But who is more of an expert on the research being published other than the author himself? If authors could/would mark up their own papers during the publication process, not only could they be assured that it would be accurate but they would help make their research universally searchable without the lag required for searchability through a specific resource. Thus far document mark-up is has not been an easy process and has largely been deemed ‘not worth the effort’ for the level of attribution/recognition affiliated with it.

The BioMed Central article does a nice job of outlining and discussing many of these issues. It cites many other efforts and resources, explains their motivation and the implementation of their software. A nice feature of the tool is that there are interoperability features, and a real commitment to conforming with existing standards of practice. The article also presents an appendix of resource addresses of other groups involved in semantic searching and literature publication. I especially like this quote from the paper:

The Word add-in presented here will assist authors in this effort using community standards and by making it possible for the author of the document, the absolute expert on the content, to do so during the authoring process and to provide this information in the original source document.

You can also find brief tutorials on using the tool at SciVee: Word Add-in for Ontology Recognition Tutorial (1 of 4): Install Process

As a note, literature mark-up and enabling are currently an active area – Mary found another literature handling resource and paper as well: Check out the tip, the articles &amp;amp; the tools. Tell me what you find/think. Thanks! (OH, and Happy St. Patty’s to ya!)

Using this special sense, they can image the body heat radiating from warm-blooded animals nearby. This enables them to track their prey quickly and with great accuracy, even in the dark, and to target the most vulnerable parts of the prey's body when they strike. It warns them of the presence of predators, and may also be used to find appropriate locations for building dens.

Infrared detection is known to be mediated by a specialized sensory apparatus called the pit organ, but several important questions about the detection mechanisms remain. It is still unclear, for example, where in the pit organ the infrared sensor is located, and whether it detects light particles directly, in a similar way to the eye, or heat energy. These questions have now been answered by a group of researchers from the University of California in San Francisco. In an advance online publication in the journal Nature, they report the identification of the sensor: it is a heat-sensitive protein called TRPA1, which is also activated by a compound found in wasabi.

&lt;p&gt;It's rare that I encounter a bit of nonsense that allows me to deploy two of my favorite rhetorical devices. First, it lets me pull out one of my favorite clips from one of my favorite movies, in which the immortal line, "Help! Help! I'm being repressed!" was first uttered. Second, it lets me repeat once again yet another variation of Inigo Montoya's immortal words. It's a two-fer! Not surprisingly, it's courtesy of the anti-vaccine crank blog we've all come to know and love (well, I love it because it has provided me such a target-rich environment for taking on quackery and woo, although I hate it because, well, it promotes anti-vaccine quackery and woo). Yes, we're talkin' Age of Autism, and this time it's Katie Wright crying repression and censorship in a little screed she called &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/03/sebelius-asks-media-to-censor-autism-debate.html"&gt;Sebelius Asks Media to Censor Autism Debate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Censor." You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll show you why. First, let's look at what provoked Wright's little bit of willful misinterpretation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are groups out there that insist that vaccines are responsible for a variety of problems, despite all scientific evidence to the contrary.

&lt;p&gt;I had asserted a well-established biological fact – the eye is not irreducibly complex. There are examples in nature of simpler eyes that represent probable stages through which the vertebrate eye evolved. I made this as part of a broader point, that many structures and systems claimed to be irreducible have known simpler antecedents, and I even provided a link to a &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/behe.html"&gt;page on Talk Origins&lt;/a&gt; that linked in turn to many articles with the evidence for this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists, however, are apparently not interested in making sound arguments or what science actually has to say about any particular question – only obfuscating the truth with misdirection and debating tactics. The commenter claimed I had not bothered to provide evidence to back up my claim, and inferred that I therefore could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That link has absolutely nothing to do with scientifically showing that  these two biological systems, specifically vision or blood clotting  could have evolved from simpler systems that were functional but served a  different purpose from their current one. It is no different than your  approach – simply declare that the argument is flawed without specific  scientific proof to the contrary but broad statements of the sort …”that  is wrong and this is how it works,” without any proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then challenged me to provide evidence for simpler antecedents in eyes. Well, challenge accepted. Of course, what he is really saying is that he is too intellectually lazy and/or dishonest to find the information himself. It is not hidden away in dusty university libraries – it’s just a few Google clicks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much trouble I was able to find links documenting what I had read from many sources – there are multiple examples of living creatures with simpler eyes – highly functional, often adapted specifically for their function, and representing a plausible path of the evolution of vertebrate eyes from nothing but a patch of light sensitive cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will anticipate the likely creationist misdirection – these examples do not represent an actual evolutionary sequence. Of course not – they are examples from extant (living) species – all of whom share a common ancestor but represent current examples of many different lineages that split off at various times in the past. They are not a sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of these living examples is to refute the claim that the eye is irreducibly complex – that if it were any simpler it could not function, or more specifically could not confer an evolutionary advantage to the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyes are soft tissue – they do not generally fossilize. So we have scant fossil evidence of eye evolution. We do have some, from species with preserved skull bones showing muscle insertions and the structure of the tissue around the eye (&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=106"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;), but not the soft parts of the eye itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some simple eye structures that work just fine for the organisms that have them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eye spot – patch of tissue or cells that are photosensitive. Organism can move toward light, or synchronize circadium rythm, but not see shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;a href="http://www.biologycorner.com/worksheets/euglenacolor.htm"&gt;Euglena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have an eye patch, the next step is for the patch of cells to become progressively depressed. This increases progressively the ability to distinguish direction, each step providing a slight advantage, until you have an Eye cup. Eye cups are able to tell direction of light better than eye patch – the more cupped the eye, the finer the angle of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarian"&gt;Planarian &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an eye cup continues to deepen, eventually the outer rim of the cup with close in on itself, forming a Pinhole eye. The pinhole eye works like a simple camera, and is able not only to distinguish direction quite well but also make out basic shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus"&gt;Nautilius &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pinhole is still open to the outside world, however, so the formation of a transparent cell layer over the hole has an obvious advantage. Once this happens, that opens the door for layering and specialization, including forming a pocket of cells to act as a lens. A primitive lens would focus light into the eye, increasing the amount of light falling on the retina. Before this was sufficiently refined for the lens to focus an image sharply on the retina, a weak primitive lens would still amplify light. This would allow sea creature to see at greater and greater depths, until they had a strong lens that could focus in on the retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:  &lt;a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Built+for+blurs:+jellyfish+have+great+eyes+that+can%27t+focus-a0133108537"&gt;Box Jellyfish &lt;/a&gt;- have primitive lenses that do not focus, adapted for low light environments. Jellys in brighter environments have simpler eyes without lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now you have all the basic elements of a vertebrate eye, requiring only progressive refinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again – this line of evidence does not prove that or how the vertebrate eye evolved. It simply demonstrates that simpler eyes, all the way down to a patch of light sensitive cells, could work and provide an adaptive function – therefore the eye is not irreducibly complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other lines of evidence, however, from genetics, fossil evidence, and the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=326"&gt;suboptimal design of the vertebrate eye&lt;/a&gt;, that point directly at evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this evidence will not stop trolling creationists from leaving comments claiming the eye could not have evolved because it is just too complex. Creationists have a flat learning curve when it comes to evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum: I also found this article: &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v8/n12/full/nrn2283.html"&gt;Evolution of the vertebrate eye: opsins, photoreceptors, retina and eye cup.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice article published in Nature that reviews the evolution of the vertebrate eye giving examples of the various simpler stages with vertebrate relatives. In other words, this is as close to an evolutionary sequence as we can get with extant species. This goes beyond plausibility, and beyond demolishing irreducible complexity, to documenting the evolution of the vertebrate eye specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is ironic that creationists continue to use the eye as the example of the complex structure that defies evolutionary explanation – when in reality the various eyes that have evolved in nature represent one of the best lines of morphological evidence for evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268828798065"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/dendro_dissidents.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/60ac3b3810bf3240</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Dendro Dissidents</title><published>2010-03-17T13:20:30Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T13:20:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/5mZnWyE-7o0/dendro_dissidents.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2010/03/dendro_dissidents.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How long ago was the time of Emperor Augustus? Most educated people, including professional historians and archaeologists, will reply "about 2000 years" if you ask them. But a considerable number of amateur dendrochronologists say "&lt;a href="http://www.cybis.se/forfun/dendro/hollstein/index.htm?PHPSESSID=60b143a716e9d8faf7d72f365c5ad875"&gt;about 1800 years&lt;/a&gt;". And because of an unfortunate peculiarity in how professional dendrochronologists work, it is very hard to convince these dissident amateurs that they are wrong. Because they're actually thinking straight given the data available to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at published dendro curves for the transalpine provinces of the Empire, you find that they contain two main blocks of information covering the past 2500 years or so. There's one that extends solidly from today and back to about AD 400, consisting of many tightly interlinked samples. And then there's a Roman-era block that is also quite solid internally. But between the two blocks is a period of about 200 years when there are very few samples. It appears to be hard to find preserved timber that grew in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. There are enough samples to satisfy professionals that they actually have the whole 2000 years covered, but the sample overlaps for the gap between the blocks are few and rather weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional dendrochronologists explain this lack of finds by reference to the cessation of Roman building projects and to deforestation during the Imperial centuries. According to the accepted model, the reason that there are so few samples covering the gap between the blocks is that few trees were of a suitable age for construction timber during that time and even fewer were used to build anything that has been preserved. Trees that fell into bogs and rivers at the time would have too few rings to be of much use to dendrochronology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dissident amateurs instead think that the Roman block and the recent block have been joined incorrectly, and that there shouldn't be any gap at all between them in the diagrams. According to them, the professionals have been fooled by the early historians Dionysius Exiguus and Beda Venerabilis into thinking that the Western Empire fell 1600 years ago, using this as an axiom in their work with the dendro curves, when in fact it happened only 1400 years ago. A common idea about why this should be so is that the Church of Rome added a couple of centuries to its age to gain legitimacy: in other words, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesis"&gt;a conspiracy of early historians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned published dendro curves. The rub here is that most dendro data are never published. They are kept as in-house secrets in dendro labs in order for these to be able to sell their services to archaeologists. So when the amateurs challenge the professionals' opinion, all the latter can reply is "We know we're right but we can't show you how we know". And that is of course an unscientific approach to the issue. The amateurs rarely get access to 1st Millennium wood samples, and basically have to work with the past 1000 years in their own studies. And so they cultivate a dissident opinion that could swiftly be laid to rest -- or be accepted as fact -- if wood samples and measurement databases were only made public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess, though, is that any Roman archaeologist could solve the controversy quite easily, perhaps even using published radiocarbon dates. All you need are a couple of well-sourced dates for contexts known to be from about the time of the first emperors, such as Pompeii. (But if you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that a context is from that time, then you have very little reason to pay for radiocarbon dating.) Because although the calibration curve for radiocarbon depends on dendrochronology, several of the available datasets are not from European wood samples. And there is of course no inherent bias about where on the diagram the fall of Rome should be in North American dendrochronology, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009734" title=""&gt;Generous Leaders and Selfish Underdogs: Pro-Sociality in Despotic Macaques&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Actively granting food to a companion is called pro-social behavior and is considered to be part of altruism. Recent findings show that some non-human primates behave pro-socially. However, pro-social behavior is not expected in despotic species, since the steep dominance hierarchy will hamper pro-sociality. We show that some despotic long-tailed macaques do grant others access to food. Moreover, their dominance hierarchy determines pro-social behavior in an unexpected way: high-ranking individuals grant, while low-ranking individuals withhold their partner access to food. Surprisingly, pro-social behavior is not used by subordinates to obtain benefits from dominants, but by dominants to emphasize their dominance position. Hence, Machiavellian macaques rule not through "fear above love", but through "be feared when needed and loved when possible".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009740" title=""&gt;Honeybee Associative Learning Performance and Metabolic Stress Resilience Are Positively Associated&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Social-environmental influences can affect animal cognition and health. Also, human socio-economic status is a covariate factor connecting psychometric test-performance (a measure of cognitive ability), educational achievement, lifetime health, and survival. The complimentary hypothesis, that mechanisms in physiology can explain some covariance between the same traits, is disputed. Possible mechanisms involve metabolic biology affecting integrity and stability of physiological systems during development and ageing. Knowledge of these relationships is incomplete, and underlying processes are challenging to reveal in people. Model animals, however, can provide insights into connections between metabolic biology and physiological stability that may aid efforts to reduce human health and longevity disparities. We document a positive correlation between a measure of associative learning performance and the metabolic stress resilience of honeybees. This relationship is independent of social factors, and may provide basic insights into how central nervous system (CNS) function and metabolic biology can be associated. Controlling for social environment, age, and learning motivation in each bee, we establish that learning in Pavlovian conditioning to an odour is positively correlated with individual survival time in hyperoxia. Hyperoxia induces oxidative metabolic damage, and provides a measure of metabolic stress resistance that is often related to overall lifespan in laboratory animals. The positive relationship between Pavlovian learning ability and stress resilience in the bee is not equally established in other model organisms so far, and contrasts with a genetic cost of improved associative learning found in Drosophila melanogaster. Similarities in the performances of different animals need not reflect common functional principles. A correlation of honeybee Pavlovian learning and metabolic stress resilience, thereby, is not evidence of a shared biology that will give insight about systems integrity in people. Yet, the means to resolve difficult research questions often come from findings in distant areas of science while the model systems that turn out to be valuable are sometimes the least predictable. Our results add to recent findings indicating that honeybees can become instrumental to understanding how metabolic biology influences life outcomes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009612" title=""&gt;Modelling the Species Distribution of Flat-Headed Cats (Prionailurus planiceps), an Endangered South-East Asian Small Felid&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps) is one of the world&amp;#39;s least known, highly threatened felids with a distribution restricted to tropical lowland rainforests in Peninsular Thailand/Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. Throughout its geographic range large-scale anthropogenic transformation processes, including the pollution of fresh-water river systems and landscape fragmentation, raise concerns regarding its conservation status. Despite an increasing number of camera-trapping field surveys for carnivores in South-East Asia during the past two decades, few of these studies recorded the flat-headed cat. In this study, we designed a predictive species distribution model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm to reassess the potential current distribution and conservation status of the flat-headed cat. Eighty-eight independent species occurrence records were gathered from field surveys, literature records, and museum collections. These current and historical records were analysed in relation to bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), altitude (SRTM) and minimum distance to larger water resources (Digital Chart of the World). Distance to water was identified as the key predictor for the occurrence of flat-headed cats (&amp;gt;50% explanation). In addition, we used different land cover maps (GLC2000, GlobCover and SarVision LLC for Borneo), information on protected areas and regional human population density data to extract suitable habitats from the potential distribution predicted by the MaxEnt model. Between 54% and 68% of suitable habitat has already been converted to unsuitable land cover types (e.g. croplands, plantations), and only between 10% and 20% of suitable land cover is categorised as fully protected according to the IUCN criteria. The remaining habitats are highly fragmented and only a few larger forest patches remain. Based on our findings, we recommend that future conservation efforts for the flat-headed cat should focus on the identified remaining key localities and be implemented through a continuous dialogue between local stakeholders, conservationists and scientists to ensure its long-term survival. The flat-headed cat can serve as a flagship species for the protection of several other endangered species associated with the threatened tropical lowland forests and surface fresh-water sources in this region.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009743" title=""&gt;Bridgehead Effect in the Worldwide Invasion of the Biocontrol Harlequin Ladybird&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent studies of the routes of worldwide introductions of alien organisms suggest that many widespread invasions could have stemmed not from the native range, but from a particularly successful invasive population, which serves as the source of colonists for remote new territories. We call here this phenomenon the invasive bridgehead effect. Evaluating the likelihood of such a scenario is heuristically challenging. We solved this problem by using approximate Bayesian computation methods to quantitatively compare complex invasion scenarios based on the analysis of population genetics (microsatellite variation) and historical (first observation dates) data. We applied this approach to the Harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (HA), a coccinellid native to Asia that was repeatedly introduced as a biocontrol agent without becoming established for decades. We show that the recent burst of worldwide invasions of HA followed a bridgehead scenario, in which an invasive population in eastern North America acted as the source of the colonists that invaded the European, South American and African continents, with some admixture with a biocontrol strain in Europe. This demonstration of a mechanism of invasion via a bridgehead has important implications both for invasion theory (i.e., a single evolutionary shift in the bridgehead population versus multiple changes in case of introduced populations becoming invasive independently) and for ongoing efforts to manage invasions by alien organisms (i.e., heightened vigilance against invasive bridgeheads).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009733" title=""&gt;Benthic Composition of a Healthy Subtropical Reef: Baseline Species-Level Cover, with an Emphasis on Algae, in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) are considered to be among the most pristine coral reef ecosystems remaining on the planet. These reefs naturally contain a high percent cover of algal functional groups with relatively low coral abundance and exhibit thriving fish communities dominated by top predators. Despite their highly protected status, these reefs are at risk from both direct and indirect anthropogenic sources. This study provides the first comprehensive data on percent coverage of algae, coral, and non-coral invertebrates at the species level, and investigates spatial diversity patterns across the archipelago to document benthic communities before further environmental changes occur in response to global warming and ocean acidification. Monitoring studies show that non-calcified macroalgae cover a greater percentage of substrate than corals on many high latitude reef sites. Forereef habitats in atoll systems often contain high abundances of the green macroalga Microdictyon setchellianum and the brown macroalga Lobophora variegata, yet these organisms were uncommon in forereefs of non-atoll systems. Species of the brown macroalgal genera Padina, Sargassum, and Stypopodium and the red macroalgal genus Laurencia became increasingly common in the two northernmost atolls of the island chain but were uncommon components of more southerly islands. Conversely, the scleractinian coral Porites lobata was common on forereefs at southern islands but less common at northern islands. Currently accepted paradigms of what constitutes a "healthy" reef may not apply to the subtropical NWHI, and metrics used to gauge reef health (e.g., high coral cover) need to be reevaluated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009727" title=""&gt;Progression of the "Psychological Typhoon Eye" and Variations Since the Wenchuan Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2008 after a massive earthquake jolted Wenchuan, China, we reported an effect that we termed a &amp;quot;Psychological Typhoon Eye&amp;quot;: the closer to the center of the devastated area, the lower the level of concern felt by residents about safety and health. We now report on the progression of this effect and the development of new variations after the quake as well as investigating potential explanations. We conducted two sequential surveys of 5,216 residents in non-devastated and devastated areas in September-October 2008 and April-May 2009. Respondents were asked five questions to assess their concerns about safety and health. A MANCOVA showed a significant inverse effect of residential devastation level on the estimated number of medical and psychological workers needed, the estimated probability of an epidemic outbreak, and the estimated number of self-protective behaviors needed (Ps&amp;lt;0.001), in spite of the passage of one year. The level of post-earthquake concern decreased significantly with an increase in the residential devastation level. Additionally, we observed two variations in the &amp;quot;Psychological Typhoon Eye&amp;quot; effect, in that the respondents&amp;#39; concern decreased with increasing relational distance between a respondent and victims who had suffered either physical or economic damage. The previously reported effect of a &amp;quot;Psychological Typhoon Eye&amp;quot; remains robust over a 1-year period. We found that the &amp;quot;psychological immunization&amp;quot; theory did not provide a satisfactory explanation for these intriguing results. Our findings may be useful in understanding how people become resilient to threats.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_261.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/rrOGWDMUyLo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268828165943"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=12836">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e9e3a19904571ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 3.17</title><published>2010-03-17T12:00:38Z</published><updated>2010-03-17T12:00:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/2010/03/skepchick-quickies-3-17/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

The light, they say, is very bright, lasts for a couple of hours, stays near the horizon, changes colors, and keeps coming back to the same spot night after night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Bthocaqf0"&gt;Here’s an MSNBC report about it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/X5Bthocaqf0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26hd%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be an alien visitor from another world?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No, I don’t think so. In fact, I think it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another world. Venus, to be specific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Fort Wayne, Indiana website &lt;a href="http://www.wane.com/dpps/news/strange/ufo-sighting-caught-on-tape-in-ohio-jgr_3263531"&gt;has an interview with one of the witnesses on video, and includes some still shots&lt;/a&gt;. Everything in his description, including the photographs, makes me think he and the others are seeing Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Venus can be seen in the west — the direction to Lake Erie and Cleveland as seen in Euclid —  shining brightly just after sunset. It is so bright it can be seen while the sky is still light (I’ve seen Venus in the middle of the day). It appears to hover. Changing atmospheric conditions can affect its color, especially when it’s low to the horizon. It can be seen night after night, in the same spot in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying what these people are seeing is in fact Venus, but it sure fits everything I’ve heard in the news reports (sometimes the witnesses describe multiple lights, but when looking to the horizon, especially over a big city, it’s not too unlikely to see planes flying around). In the MSNBC report they talked to the FAA, the military, and others (including a UFO guy from England), but never talked to an astronomer. Hmmph. And note that in these news articles, Venus is never mentioned! That’s mighty peculiar, given how spectacular it is in the west after sunset. It’s really hard to miss. A likely explanation is that it’s not mentioned because it is, in fact, the culprit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting a kick out of just how positive so many people are that this is a flying saucer of some kind. I wonder how many of these folks actually are familiar with the night sky, and would recognize Venus when they see it? &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/21/slamming-the-astronomers-should-see-ufos-myth/"&gt;That’s why I think&lt;/a&gt; very few astronomers (pro or amateur) report UFOs: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/25/aliens-yes-ufos-no/"&gt;astronomers tend to know what they’re looking at in the sky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you hear a report like this, don’t jump to the conclusion that some interplanetary object is making a close encounter… because it may very well be interplanetary, but the encounter may not be terribly close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly – thanks to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/LeslieCannold"&gt;Leslie Cannold again from Twitter&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/10/03/16/1613219/Jobcentre-Apologizes-For-Anti-Jedi-Discrimination?from=rss&amp;amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Slashdot%2Fslashdot+%28Slashdot%29"&gt;Jobcentre apologies for anti-Jedi discrimination, from Slash-dot:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Chris Jarvis, 31, is described as a Star Wars fan and member of the International Church of Jediism.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gack&lt;/em&gt;… Sounds like a mixture of Oprah and her ‘vajay-jay’ nonsense and The Secret, no? And to think, just after Jamie Kilstein had a flaming-comedy-routine at the Global Atheist Convention all about the &lt;a href="http://churchofthesmilingvagina.com/"&gt;Church of the Smiling Vagina&lt;/a&gt;. I think at least his version will guarantee a NSFW laugh without the price-tag and emotional blackmail on how ‘you’re just not curing your condition due to your negative attitude’. :/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourthly – prom banning in the USA: &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/fulton-ms-prom-discrimination"&gt;Fulton MS Prom Discrimination at the ACLU:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ACLU wants Itawamba County School District officials in Fulton, Mississippi to reverse their decision to forbid a lesbian student from attending prom with her girlfriend and from wearing a tuxedo to the prom. Constance McMillen, a student at Itawamba Agricultural High School, came to the ACLU for help after school officials told her that she could not come to prom with her girlfriend, also a student at IAHS, and that if they arrived separately but slow-danced together they might be thrown out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional note – as a high-school teacher I had a conversation here in Australia with a former deputy who had not outed herself as a lesbian during her career. When the parents of a lesbian student approached the school about how their daughter could not bring her girlfriend as her partner at their Year 12 ball, she had to bend to the school’s decision and uphold the ruling. The parents pointed out that if their daughter had NOT willingly outed herself, she could have had her girlfriend attend as a ‘friend’. It was something the deputy greatly regretted supporting and indicative of how we still have a damned long way to go even in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh – and Ms Deveny with ‘&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://catherinedeveny.com/wordpress/?page_id=526"&gt;Banging on about atheism? 438 columns. Only 12 of them about religion. Why I won’t stop&lt;/a&gt;‘.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Dennett&lt;/strong&gt; and clinical social worker &lt;strong&gt;Linda LaScola&lt;/strong&gt; have interviewed several &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; pastors (current!) who have &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/daniel_c_dennett/2010/03/skeptical_clergy_a_silent_majority.html"&gt;doubts about what they preach&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With the help of a grant from a small foundation, administered through Tufts University, we set out to find some closeted nonbelievers who would agree to be intensively — and, of course, confidentially–interviewed… For this pilot study we managed to identify five brave pastors, all still actively engaged with parishes, who were prepared to trust us with their stories.  All five are Protestants, with master’s level seminary education.  Three represented liberal denominations (the liberals) and two came from more conservative, evangelical traditions (the literals)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They admit this is a self-selected survey, but what is amazing is the fact that any — in fact, several — pastors don’t believe what they have made their living preaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to know where they found these pastors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ultimately, the five participants came from two sources: two from a list of clergy who had originally contacted the Center for Progressive Christianity (TCPC) for general information, and three from people who had personally contacted Dan Barker, co-director of the Freedom from Religion Foundation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/Non-Believing-Clergy.pdf"&gt;what the pastors had to say&lt;/a&gt; here (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quotations from the pastors are heartbreaking.  In some cases, they’ve been entrenched in their faith for so long that they don’t know what else to do.  As one pastor puts it, it’s like trying to switch your major when you’re so close to graduating: Why not just finish up what you started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re locked into the role, it’s very difficult to leave.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what one pastor said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Here’s how I’m handling my job on Sunday mornings:  I see it as play acting.  I kind of see myself as taking on a role of a believer in a worship service, and performing. Because I know what to say.  I know how to pray publicly. I can lead singing. I love singing.  I don’t believe what I’m saying anymore in some of these songs.  But I see it as taking on the role and performing.  Maybe that’s what it takes for me to get myself through this, but that’s what I’m doing.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He calls it acting.  I call it being a hypocrite.  He’s lying to himself and everyone in his church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this isn’t the same thing, but I entered college planning on becoming a doctor.  I was accepted into a special program that gave me a “free seat” in medical school right out of high school.  If I maintained a certain undergrad GPA and earned a certain score on my MCATs, they’d retain my med school seat and I wouldn’t have to go through all the trouble of applying everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did all that.  And I went to med school.  I honestly never even considered any other careers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that first year, my grades were fine, but the passion and interest I had just went away.  I had been teaching MCAT classes full-time and I loved it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teaching made me really happy.  Medicine stressed me out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t imagine leaving med school, though.  How would I break that to my family?  Everyone who knew me in high school knew I had wanted to become a doctor… hell, even if I wanted to become a teacher, I didn’t know how to go about making that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and try telling your girlfriend that you’re thinking about leaving med school to become a teacher.  Woo!  That’s fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I knew I had to do it or I’d regret it.  I probably could’ve been a good doctor, but I’d always wonder about the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a year off of school to explore teaching.  I got certified.  I moved home for a bit.  I started working with atheist groups more.  The eBay thing happened during that time off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took two (emotionally tough) years in all, but I eventually started teaching.  It’s been three years now.  I’m *so* glad I made the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand what it’s like to be in a position you feel trapped in… you have a lot of time and effort (and money) invested in your current life, and changing it is a big risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if these pastors don’t believe what they’re preaching, they owe it to themselves and their congregations to step away and try something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what another pastor said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He is planning to leave the ministry as soon he finds another way to support his family.  He would leave sooner, if he had enough money to pay off his debts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“If somebody said, ‘Here’s $200,000,’ I’d be turning my notice in this week, saying, ‘A month from now is my last Sunday.’  Because then I can pay off everything.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, he is quietly pursuing another career.  His wife is aware of his plan to switch careers, but he hasn’t told her yet of his reason for the change.  He thinks she will be both upset and supportive of whatever he wants to do. Mutual support has been the pattern in their marriage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be wonderful if an atheist group could offer a program for current pastors who wanted to leave their faith to get back on their feet in another line of work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do all these pastors have in common?  The authors write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The loneliness of non-believing pastors is extreme. They have no trusted confidantes to reassure them, to reflect their own musings back to them, to provide reality checks. As their profiles reveal, even their spouses are often unaware of their turmoil. Why don’t they resign their posts and find a new life? They are caught in a trap, cunningly designed to harness both their best intentions and their basest fears to the task of immobilizing them in their predicament. Their salaries are modest and the economic incentive is to stay in place, to hang on by their fingernails and wait for retirement when they get their pension.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They need help.  They need to know it’s ok to leave the church.  It may take a while to get back up on their feet, but there are other places out there that need their skills — communication, counseling, teaching, leading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, bigots at the Itawamba County Agricultural High School in Mississippi were faced with a big problem: a &lt;em&gt;gay&lt;/em&gt; was planning to show up to &lt;em&gt;prom&lt;/em&gt; and convert all the poor innocent hetero kids to &lt;em&gt;gayism&lt;/em&gt; with their gay germs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autostraddle.com/lesbian-prom-37132/"&gt;&lt;img title="Lesbian Prom Pic via Autostraddle.com!" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/england-2009-225x300.jpg" alt="Lesbian Prom Pic via Autostraddle.com!" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The school board canceled the prom due to “distractions” after  Constance McMillen (that’s not her to the right . . . see &lt;a href="http://www.autostraddle.com/lesbian-prom-37132/"&gt;Autostraddle.com&lt;/a&gt;’s response to this story) requested permission to wear a tux and bring her girlfriend as her date. The horror! First the board tried banning her from the event, and when the ACLU stood up for her and demanded she be allowed to attend, the board took their ball and ran home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/10/national/main6287246.shtml"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, “District officials say they hope private citizens will host a prom.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, private citizens have stepped up. In particular, &lt;a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/news/details/2010-03-humanists-prepare-to-hold-lgbt-inclusive-prom-in-miss"&gt;godless heathen citizens&lt;/a&gt;! Well done to Todd and Diana Stiefel for donating $20,000 through the American Humanist Association to host a secular, inclusive event.&lt;/p&gt;

(The clip is about nine minutes long and you can read the listeners’ comments &lt;a href="http://www.thomhartmann.com/2010/03/16/daily-topics-march-16th-2010/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) McHugh heads a young-earth creationist organization, &lt;a href="http://www.homeschools.org/"&gt;CLASS&lt;/a&gt;, that sells home-school materials on biology to parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that while desperately trying to defend his (and his company’s) notion that the earth is 6,000 years old, McHugh makes a couple of wonky arguments.  The first is that there are “no neutral facts.”  That is, every fact militates either for or against a certain worldview.  McHugh’s suggestion for how to educate your kids involves choosing which worldview suits them best, and then selecting the “facts” that fit this worldview.  I am not making this up: he says it explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, forced into a corner by Hartmann, who basically takes him apart, McHugh resorts to the old defense that religious views of science must be correct because scientists as eminent as Newton were religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you listen to McHugh, you’ll see what kind of “biology” hundreds of thousands of American kids learn at home.  It’s beyond belief that, in the name of “education,” McHugh and other Christian home-school outfits profit from peddling lies to children.&lt;/p&gt;

One of the main reasons for this is the severe lack of evidence for many of it&amp;#39;s proposals given that the paucity of fossilised brains fails to bolster many a case. And it isn&amp;#39;t even anyone&amp;#39;s fault. That&amp;#39;s just the way it goes sometimes, that the brain is a jelly-like substance that is subject to decay after death, and there&amp;#39;s no way we can objectively analyse or verify any differences in brains of long ago with brains of today.

This isn&amp;#39;t set to change anytime soon, but the remarkable discovery of a medieval child&amp;#39;s brain was the subject of a Neuroimage paper published recently. This is extremely exciting on many counts: the brain has been so fantastically preserved that it is possible to identify the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes, and even the sulci and gyri, the grooves and furrows channeled into brains....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Upon unwrapping her lunch, she had a focal seizure with witnessed onset on the right side of the face and secondary generalization... She was airlifted to hospital. Three weeks later, the smell of food triggered another seizure and she was admitted to the neurology unit...Even hospital fare was able to provoke the attacks:The next morning, the patient had a simple partial seizure after eating a spoonful of porridge. Thereafter, most meals triggered seizures, as did other food-related stimuli such as being offered a piece of cake, seeing her visitors pass around food at her bedside, and smelling the hospital dinner trolley.Anti-convulsant drugs failed to control the seizures. An MRI scan revealed an abnormal mass and electrode recordings from the surface of the brain confirmed that the seizure activity was starting nearby. The mass was surgically removed - it turned out to have been a  grade IV glioblastoma cancer - which put an end to the seizures, although sadly we&amp;#39;re told that the surgery was &amp;quot;subtotal&amp;quot; i.e. they weren&amp;#39;t able to remove the tumour entirely.The authors note that eating-induced seizures have been reported hundreds of times, most commonly in India and Sri Lanka, curiously enough, but this is the first known case in which merely seeing or thinking about food was also a trigger. Why it happens is a mystery: presumably, neural activation in response to the taste or smell of food somehow spills over into the epileptic focus... but the details are sketchy.In this case, seizures were specifically triggered by food-related stimuli in the context of hunger. The finding of a seizure focus in the left frontal operculum, adjacent to the tumor, is consistent with the hypothesis that activation of this region by appetite triggered seizure activity that then propagated to the surrounding cortex and was manifest clinically as a motor seizure.El Bouzidi K, Duncan S, Whittle IR, &amp;amp; Butler CR (2010).

For example, women reminded of the stereotype that men are better at maths tend to perform more poorly in a subsequent maths task, even if they are actually treated fairly. Now Julie Henry and colleagues have extended this line of research to the domain of mental health. They&amp;#39;ve found that patients with a schizophrenia diagnosis function less well socially, when they think that the person they&amp;#39;re chatting with knows their diagnosis.Thirty people diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder spent a few minutes chatting on their own to one research assistant and then they did the same with another assistant an hour later. There were a few points of deception: first, the participants were led to believe that the assistants were participants from another study. Also, most importantly, before one of the conversations began, they were told that the assistant knew about their diagnosis of schizophrenia; before the other, they were told the assistant did not know. They were also told, truthfully, that both the people they were to chat with did not themselves have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In reality, the research assistants didn&amp;#39;t know whether each participant had a diagnosis of schizophrenia or not. This was achieved by having them them chat to the participants diagnosed with schizophrenia plus a number of control participants. Crucially, they weren&amp;#39;t told in advance who was who. After each conversation, the research assistants rated the social behaviour of the person they&amp;#39;d just chatted with. The participants in turn rated the behaviour of the assistant they&amp;#39;d just chatted with and they said how they felt the conversation had gone.The key finding is that the social functioning of the participants with schizophrenia seemed to deteriorate when they thought their conversational partner knew their diagnosis (even though they didn&amp;#39;t). Specifically, when they thought their diagnosis had been disclosed, the participants were rated by the research assistants as being more impaired at initiating conversations and at switching topics appropriately, and the assistants also found these conversations less comfortable.Henry&amp;#39;s team can&amp;#39;t be sure, but they think these apparent deficits emerged because the participants&amp;#39; concern about how they would be judged, in light of their diagnosis having been disclosed, interfered with their ability to converse in a more effective manner.A further twist was that the participants with schizophrenia seemed unaware of these effects - they reported finding the conversations, in which their diagnosis was known, just as comfortable and successful as when they thought their diagnosis had been kept hidden. This contrasts with non-clinical research on stereotype threat, in which people seem to be aware of the effects on their performance.The results provide food for thought regarding when and how mental health diagnoses should be disclosed. The researchers said their findings suggest &amp;#39;that one of the defining qualities of [schizophrenia] - social skill impairment - is not caused solely by the disorder per se, but rather, also derives from feelings of being stereotyped.&amp;#39;_________________________________Henry, J., Hippel, C., &amp;amp; Shapiro, L.

&lt;p&gt;I used to refer to Drummer Man&amp;#39;s beloved as La Novia, but back last summer, they married, so she became Drummer Woman.  The former La Novia came to the relationship with a toddling girl (Dancing Girl) from her first marriage, which came apart when her daughter was still a lap baby.  Dancing Girl&amp;#39;s father hasn&amp;#39;t been involved with her life at all.  Dancing Girl&amp;#39;s father agreed to sever parental ties, and so (&lt;em&gt;big percussion event&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Drummer Man formally adopted the former Dancing Girl, who is now Drummer Girl1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony took place in the judge&amp;#39;s chambers.  He keeps an impressive array of toys, stuffed animals, etc., which he offers to each child ion the adoption process.  Drummer Girl1 chose a baby doll accessory set.  Then we went to lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who know me personally know that I&amp;#39;m [secular] [agnostic] [atheist]  but I kept thinking of this film clip from Sister Act 2, when the chorus starts out tepid and then bursts out (Oh Happy Day):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you start with a lizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, I'm not joking. Snakes didn't just appear out of nowhere, nor was there simply some massive cosmic zot of a mutation in some primordial legged ancestor that turned their progeny into slithery limbless serpents. One of the tougher lessons to get across to people is that evolution is not about abrupt transmutations of one form into another, but the gradual accumulation of many changes at the genetic level which are typically buffered and have minimal effects on the phenotype, only rarely expanding into a lineage with a marked difference in morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means in a practical sense is that if you take a distinct form of a modern clade, such as the snakes, and you look at a distinctly different form in a related clade, such as the lizards, what you may find is that the differences are resting atop a common suite of genetic changes; that snakes, for instance, are extremes in a range of genetic possibilities that are defined by novel attributes shared by all squamates (squamates being the lizards and snakes together). Lizards are not snakes, but they will have inherited some of the shared genetic differences that enabled snakes to arise from the squamate last common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you want to know where snakes came from, the right place to start is to look at their nearest cousins, the lizards, and ask what snakes and lizards have in common, that is at the same time different from more distant relatives, like mice, turtles, and people…and then you&amp;#39;ll have an idea of the shared genetic substrate that can make a snake out of a lizard-like early squamate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, one obvious place to look is at the pattern of the Hox genes. Hox genes are primary regulators of the body plan along the length of the animal; they are expressed in overlapping zones that specify morphological regions of the body, such as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral/pelvic, and caudal mesodermal tissues, where, for instance, a thoracic vertebra would have one kind of shape with associated ribs, while lumbar vertebra would have a different shape and no ribs. These identities are set up by which Hox genes are active in the tissue forming the bone. And that's what makes the Hox genes interesting in this case: where the lizard body plan has a little ribless interruption to form pelvis and hindlimbs, the snake has vertebra and ribs that just keep going and going. There must have been some change in the Hox genes (or their downstream targets) to turn a lizard into a snake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four overlapping sets of Hox genes in tetrapods, named a, b, c, and d. Each set has up to 13 individual genes, where 1 is switched on at the front of the animal and 13 is active way back in the tail. This particular study looked at just the caudal members, 10-13, since those are the genes whose expression patterns straddle the pelvis and so are likely candidates for changes in the evolution of snakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a summary diagram of the morphology and patterns of Hox gene expression in the lizard (left) and snake (right). Let's see what we can determine about the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f4.2.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f4.2-thumb-400x294-42856.jpg" width="400" height="294" alt="nature08789-f4.2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evolutionary modifications of the posterior Hox system in the whiptail lizard and corn snake. The positions of Hox expression domains along the paraxial mesoderm of whiptail lizard (32-40 somites, left) and corn snake (255-270 somites, right) are represented by black (Hox13), dark grey (Hox12), light grey (Hox11) and white (Hox10) bars, aligned with coloured schemes of the future vertebral column. Colours indicate the different vertebral regions: yellow, cervical; dark blue, thoracic; light blue, lumbar; green, sacral (in lizard) or cloacal (in snake); red, caudal. Hoxc11 and Hoxc12 were not analysed in the whiptail lizard. Note the absence of Hoxa13 and Hoxd13 from the corn snake mesoderm and the absence of Hoxd12 from the snake genome.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morphology is revealing: snakes and lizards have the same regions, cervical (yellow), thoracic (blue), sacral (or cloacal in the snake, which lacks pelvic structures in most species) in green, and caudal or tail segments (red). The differences are in quantity — snakes make a lot of ribbed thoracic segments — and detail — snakes don&amp;#39;t make a pelvis, usually, but do have specializations in that corresponding area for excretion and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where it really gets interesting is in the expression patterns of the Hox genes, shown with the bars that illustrate the regions where each Hox gene listed is expressed. They are largely similar in snake and lizard, with boundaries of Hox expression that correspond to transitions in the morphology of vertebrae. But there are revealing exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare a10/c10 in the snake and lizard. In the snake, these two genes have broader expression patterns, reaching up into the thoracic region; in the lizard, they are cut off sharply at the sacral boundary. This is interesting because in other vertebrates, the Hox 10 group is known to have the function of &lt;i&gt;suppressing&lt;/i&gt; rib formation. Yet there they are, turned on in the posterior portion of the thorax in the snake, where there are ribs all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the snake, then, Hox a10 and c10 have lost a portion of their function — they no longer shut down ribs. What is the purpose of the extended domain of a10/c10 expression? It may not have one. A comparison of the sequences of these genes between various species reveals a detectable &lt;i&gt;absence&lt;/i&gt; of signs of selection — the reason these genes happen to be active so far anteriorly is because selection has been relaxed, probably because they&amp;#39;ve lost that morphological effect of shutting down ribs. Those big bars are a consequence of simple sloppiness in a system that can afford a little slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next group of Hox genes, the 11 group, are very similar in their expression patterns in the lizard and the snake, and that reflects their specific roles. The 10 group is largely involved in repression of rib formation, but the 11 group is involved in the development of sacrum-specific structures. In birds, for instance, the Hox 11 genes are known to be involved in the development of the cloaca, a structure shared between birds, snakes, and lizards, so perhaps it isn't surprising that they aren't subject to quite as much change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 13 group has some notable differences: Hox a13 and d13 are mostly shut off in the snake. This is suggestive. The 13 group of Hox genes are the last genes, at the very end of the animal, and one of their proposed functions is to act as a terminator of patterning — turning on the Hox 13 genes starts the process of shutting down the mesoderm, shrinking the pool of tissue available for making body parts, so removing a repressor of mesoderm may promote longer periods of growth, allowing the snake to extend its length further during embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see a couple of clear correlates at the molecular level for differences in snake and lizard morphology: rib suppression has been lost in the snake Hox 10 group, and the activity of the snake Hox 13 group has been greatly curtailed, which may be part of the process of enabling greater elongation. What are the similarities between snakes and lizards that are also different from other animals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting surprise. There are some differences in Hox gene organization in the squamates as a whole, shared with both snakes and lizards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f1.2.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f1.2-thumb-400x212-42847.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="nature08789-f1.2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genomic organization of the posterior HoxD cluster. Schematic representation of the posterior HoxD cluster (from Evx2 to Hoxd10) in various vertebrate species. A currently accepted phylogenetic tree is shown on the left. The correct relative sizes of predicted exons (black boxes), introns (white or coloured boxes) and intergenic regions (horizontal thick lines) permit direct comparisons (right). Gene names are shown above each box. Colours indicate either a 1.5-fold to 2.0-fold (blue) or a more than 2.0-fold (red) increase in the size of intronic (coloured boxes) or intergenic (coloured lines) regions, in comparison with the chicken reference. Major CNEs are represented by green vertical lines: light green, CNEs conserved in both mammals and sauropsids; dark green, CNEs lost in the corn snake. Gaps in the genomic sequences are indicated by dotted lines. Transposable elements are indicated with asterisks of different colours (blue for DNA transposons; red for retrotransposons).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a diagram of the structure of the chromosome in the neighborhood of the Hox d10-13 genes in various vertebrates. For instance, look at the human and the turtle: the layout of our Hox d genes is vary similar, with 13-12-11-10 laid out with approximately the same distances between them, and furthermore, there are conserved non-coding elements, most likely important pieces of regulatory DNA, that are illustrated in light yellow-reen and dark green vertical bars, and they are the same, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the genes that stake out the locations of pelvic and tail structures in turtles and people are pretty much the same, using the same regulatory apparatus. It must be why they both have such pretty butts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now compare those same genes with the squamates, geckos, anoles, slow-worms, and corn snakes. The differences are huge: something happened in the ancestor of the squamates that released this region of the genome from some otherwise highly conserved constraints. We don't know what, but in general regulation of the Hox genes is complex and tightly interknit, and this order of animals acquired some other as yet unidentified patterning mechanism that opened up this region of genome for wider experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these regions are compared in animals like turtles and people and chickens, the genomes reveal signs of purifying selection — that is, mutations here tend to be unsuccessful, and lead to death, failure to propagate, etc., other horrible fates that mean tinkering here is largely unfavorable to fecundity (which makes sense: who wants a mutation expressed in their groinal bits?). In the squamates, the evidence in the genome does not witness to intense selection for their particular arrangement, but instead, of &lt;i&gt;relaxed&lt;/i&gt; selection — they are generally more tolerant of variations in the Hox gene complex in this area. What was found in those enlarged intergenic regions is a greater invasion of degenerate DNA sequences: lots of additional retrotransposons, like LINES and SINES, which are all junk DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So squamates have more junk in the genomic trunk, which is not necessarily expressed as an obvious phenotypic difference, but still means that they can more flexibly accommodate genetic variations in this particular area. Which means, in turn, that they have the potential to produce more radical experiments in morphology, like making a snake. The change in Hox gene regulation in the squamate ancestor did not immediately produce a limbless snake, instead it was an enabling mutation that opened the door to novel variations that did not compromise viability.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d like to point out that I don’t intend to keep writing about the convention for much longer, but this is an aspect that does interest me and has been a concern of mine for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who follow the ‘atheist-blog-scene’ would be aware that representation of women in atheism has been a topic for discussion for some time – &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/02/atheism_and_sex_and_gender.php"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/02/what-can-the-atheist-movement-learn-from-the-gay-movement.html"&gt;Greta Christina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.blaghag.com/2010/02/blag-hag-2010-census-results.html"&gt;Jen McCreight&lt;/a&gt; for example, all blogged back in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Where are all the women in atheism? Why aren’t there more on conference and convention stages? How can I support them? Are organisers thinking of minorities in general, let alone women, when selecting who should present?’&lt;/em&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a point that skepticism does not imply atheism (and vice versa – ‘&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/2009/11/the-problem-of-the-oblivious-white-male-skeptic-a-response-to-pharyngula-and-skeptifem/"&gt;The Problem Of The Oblivious White Male Skeptic? A Response To Pharyngula And SkeptiFem&lt;/a&gt;‘) and if you attended my presentation at the Global Atheist Convention, you would have seen some data in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly – the women’s panel at the GAC raised the idea of a ‘&lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/atheism-is-a-broad-church-20100316-qclu.html"&gt;No Chicks, No Excuse’ Speakers Bureau&lt;/a&gt; – I had a similar idea earlier in the year after attending Dragon*Con. Thanks to the &lt;a href="http://ohioskeptic.com/grassrootsskeptics/"&gt;Grassroots Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, the Speakers Bureau for skeptics can &lt;a href="http://www.arekphotography.com"&gt;&lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/26499_372999298603_799803603_3542141_7002681_n.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="392"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel="bookmark" href="http://ohioskeptic.com/grassrootsskeptics/?page_id=240"&gt;Speakers Bureau Sign-Up Form&lt;/a&gt; – Grassroots Skeptics is a volunteer organisation that promotes critical thinking and a reason-centered worldview by helping local skeptics groups to share tools, information and strategies, and connect with skeptical individuals and activists both locally and globally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it was that I was thinking of when I had a brief conversation about ‘tokenism’ (hell, I have a show called ‘&lt;a href="http://www.tokenskeptic.org"&gt;token skeptic&lt;/a&gt;‘, so it’s not as if I don’t know about the attitudes!) with one of the female presenters who featured in the one-hour session during the Saturday night dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue, much like she did, that more diversity overall is needed and to have a women’s panel is at least a ‘gesture’ in the right direction. More can and should be done. Do note – there are certain to be factors that the convention organisers have to consider that we as humble presenters and audience members may not be privy to, so communication in that regard is valuable too. I recall the funding issue for the GAC, which is elaborated over at the ABC Radio National Blog, by David Nicholls: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title=" More on that sore point" rel="bookmark" href="http://blogs.radionational.net.au/atheistconvention/?p=533"&gt;More on that sore point”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s also the issue of people’s profiles being better known, people’s contributions being promoted and encouraging the skills of all minorities out there so they can feel both confident and supported enough to take to the stage. (e.g.: who on earth knew who &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was beyond a few lovely, internet-keen podcast listeners?) Certainly the media is quite understandably writing exclusively about Stuart Bechman’s fantastic role as an MC, and he has a great and impressive profile as an atheist and president in comparison to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to rally for ‘&lt;em&gt;We need more X out there!&lt;/em&gt;‘ – and quite another to be additionally encouraging and understanding if they’ve never done it before or are still working on their presentation skills so they can make for a good show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen for myself how all it takes is a few nasty, unsupported, and non-constructive criticisms to a new speaker can completely destroy a burgeoning career as a presenter. &lt;em&gt;‘Got a problem with how I present? Back it up with evidence why – or shut up and show me if you have half the guts to try it yourself’.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard (possibly anecdotally?) that &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rather-Die-Than-Give-Speech/dp/1556239513"&gt;some people consider public-speaking to be the last thing they’d sign up for&lt;/a&gt;, and so we should factor that in with all the other factors like ‘work / family / travel’ that people often muse about in regards to what might prevent a woman, a member of a cultural minority, et al., from presenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to classes to learn and improve my presentation skills months ahead of time before doing the MC role, for example. Being on a stage is not the same as being in control of a class of teenagers (no matter what criticism you have of audience members who can’t distinguish between ’statement’ and ‘question’!)  I had to work out that my new job would be able to handle my absence and (as I now have a nasty cold!) had to factor in what it might do to my well-being – I’ve over-committed myself to things in the past like my studies and that adversely influenced my health. I also had to factor in issues involving my family and the cost. Not unusual for anyone, I should imagine, regardless whether they’re male or female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘professionals’ we see on the circuit again and again are more often than not very well-trained or perhaps have had exposure to good models that make them the first we sign up to conferences. Helping people to be good presenters, to learn how to promote their research, to help take their stories and experiences and make them riveting presentations like those by Taslima Nasrin and the women on the panel, is something that has to be considered. Mentorship is another factor that we could take into account. I don’t know if people noticed that I was checking out Prof. Richard Dawkins notes while he was on the stage, taking mental notes on how he structured his presentation! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned this several times – and interviewed people in that regard – Science Communication is a discipline that has degrees dedicated to it. Much like media outreach, there are skills to be learned and audience dynamics and appeal to consider. Being responsible for one’s presentation includes reflecting and improving – every actor, comedian, dancer would mostly likely say the same. Rehearsal, rewriting, reviewing – why shouldn’t a presenter on atheism be exempt? I saw for myself backstage a variety of techniques being used, from reviewing notes, rehearsing to the wall, to vocal exercises and relaxation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised to know from a variety of conferences I’ve attended how some of the most confident-seeming, media-savvy people have shyly gone into shut-down mode after a presentation just to gather their thoughts and deal with the adrenalin hit! &lt;em&gt;‘But they’re so quiet after? They were on fire on stage! Are they ignoring me?’&lt;/em&gt; – no, they’re trying to get back to planet earth after being on cloud nine in front of a thousand-plus eyes and thinking of a billion-plus errors they think they made!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen the likes of skeptical activist Loretta Marron improve by leaps and bounds over several years of seeing her present on the stage – and I’m aware that I pared down my presentation even further after reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199732051?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=podblack-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199732051"&gt;Explaining Research: How to Reach Key Audiences to Advance Your Work&lt;/a&gt;, which was recommended by &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/clock"&gt;Bora of Science Blogs&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not the only text out there, of course, and even watching TED talks can be of use when thinking &lt;em&gt;‘what would I like to see if I was in the audience, watching me talk about this topic? Is this an academic crowd, or a mixed group of people? Can I assume everyone is a skeptically-minded person like myself?’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you notice anyone else at the convention openly call themselves a ’skeptic’ on the stage? I know of a few who are – Robyn Williams is known as a great science communicator and the brilliant Sue-Ann Post said she’s read my work and would be willing to write for the Australian Skeptic (and she better do!). But I was the ‘token skeptic’ out there who presented on something different to the others. I talked of my research, talked of future directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t there to elaborate on the philosophy, to rally people like some of the others did. But I hope I did get a message across that it’s not really as simple as it seems to pigeon-hole people as ‘believers’ and ‘non-believers’. I think that it’s within us all to be the pre-and-post Dan Barker, acting with one belief for much of one’s life and then changing your world-view over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Barker spent years preaching, to hundreds of thousands of people, invaluable on-the-job-training. Just think, if all people who wished to communicate important messages and help promote rationalism had similar training to many of the charismatic religious leaders out there, with support, funding, training and research into how to reach the masses – what we could do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the influence of role-models isn’t as cut-and-dried as you may very well think (as discussed by Michael McRae – &lt;a title="Permanent link to Episode Nine - On Skepticism And Communication" rel="bookmark" href="http://tokenskeptic.org/2010/02/05/episode-nine-on-skepticism-and-communication/"&gt;Episode Nine – On Skepticism And Communication&lt;/a&gt;) – having a growth in successful communicators in general can’t be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a plan in mind. Presenting at this conference was one of mine and I prepared for it. Let’s help others do the same if you want more interesting people -  male, female, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Aboriginal, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, rural and remote areas, inner-city, suburban or a million other permutations and orientations -  to get their message across well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently picked up a little present for my dear friend &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi"&gt; Randi&lt;/a&gt;.  Several years ago I had the honor of spending a semester as an intern with Randi and his co-horts at his educational institution. I enjoyed the experience so much that I went back for another month the next year, and I try to attend as many Randi events as I can. I’m 99% sure that I’ll make it to this year’s The Amaz!ng Meeting 8, so I hope to see some of you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I travel I always send Randi postcards. He seems to enjoy them. When I went to Oman a couple of months ago I picked up a mosque-shaped alarm clock in addition to the usual postcard. This plastic clock recites the call to prayer in a gravely, electronic cadence and is an &lt;a href="http://www.mosqueclock.com/fun.php"&gt;exciting way to wake up in the morning&lt;/a&gt;. It took me a few weeks to get it in the post, but I finally did. My mom was there (she was on a recent Randi cruise) to record Randi’s excitement at having his very own mosque alarm clock. I thought you might enjoy a link to the video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://s358.photobucket.com/albums/oo28/kittynh/TAA5/?action=view&amp;amp;current=118.flv"&gt;Mr. Randi and the Mosque Clock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, mom, for sending this to me!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick aside, although I am an atheist I mean no disrepect to muslims here. The mosque clock is funny– not because of the call to prayer but because of its cheesy nature, cheap plastic, and bad electronics. And because it keeps going on forever! While I do not share their religion, I have the respect for my friends and colleagues… who also happen to be muslims. Just as I do for my friends and colleagues who also happen to be Christian or Jewish or Agnostic. So, take on religion all you want in other threads– but please keep the comments respectful here. It’s a sensitive topic for me, especially since I work in the Middle East. I’ll blog about it more sometime. For now,  just repeat the mosque video and have another laugh.

The first post details how I came about to ask this question when launching my independent research laboratory. The second post details the life and careers of the legendary physician-scientist pioneer, Dr. Florence Rena Sabin.

Today, we take up a discussion where we will finally learn the origin of HeLa S3 cells, complete with original literature citations.

A recap

We left our previous discussion with the final and still-productive years of Dr. Florence Rena Sabin. After graduating from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1900, Dr. Sabin embarked on a nearly 40-year career at Hopkins and now-Rockefeller University, elucidating the developmental origin of the lymphatics and antibody responses to tuberculosis and training a generation of physician-scientists. She was truly a pioneer, becoming the first woman to be appointed to faculty at Johns Hopkins, their first female full professor, the first female full member (full prof-equivalent) at Rockefeller, and the first woman invited to join the National Academy of Sciences.

Upon her retirement in 1938, she returned to her native Colorado to join her sister, Mary. Near the end of World War II, she was tapped by the Colorado governor to lead a committee that would address existing public health issues in the state that would have to be solved while absorbing a large number of men and women returning from the war to civilian life. Although in her 70s, Sabin was highly effective and shared the 1950 Lasker Award for Public Service. In 1951, the University of Colorado School of Medicine honored her with the dedication of the Florence R. Sabin Research Building for Cellular Biology.

That same fall was a sharp contrast for the Virginia-born tobacco farmer, Henrietta Lacks. She, too, was spending time at Johns Hopkins. But in this case, it was because her life was being cut short at age 31 from an aggressive case of cervical cancer. 

In the months before her death on October 4, 1951, cells derived from her tumor had been successfully cultured in the Hopkins laboratory of Dr. George Gey. These cells were called HeLa, so named for the first two letters of Henrietta Lacks&amp;#39;s names, and took a place in history as the first human cell line to be continually propagated in culture. They would live on in laboratories not only at Hopkins but around the world, including that of Colorado geneticist, Dr. Theodore &amp;quot;Ted&amp;quot; Puck.

From bacteria and bacteriophage to human genetics

Ted Puck came to Colorado a few years earlier.  His 1994 autobiography in the American Journal of Medical Genetics tells you far more than I can here. Here he shares his situation before the Sabin Building became available:

On my arrival in Denver in 1948, I first became aware of the magnitude of the responsibility which I had undertaken. The total contribution of the medical school to the budget of the Department of Biophysics was $5,000 per year. All the rest was to come from grant funds. I was the only faculty member in the newly formed department which was required to present a major course to the medical students, to institute graduate training leading to the Ph.D. degree in biophysics, to conduct a post-doctoral training program for

M.D.&amp;#39;s and Ph.D&amp;#39;s, to conduct a significant research program in biophysical science, and to raise the necessary grant funds for those activities. An old unused lumber room in the basement of the medical school was cleaned out, painted, and transformed into offices and a laboratory for the department.  A native of Chicago, Dr. Puck did both his undergraduate (1937) and graduate training (1940) at the University of Chicago. His doctoral mentor in Physical Chemistry was Dr. James Franck, a physicist who had shared the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics. Puck&amp;#39;s PhD work focused on the atomic transitions in chlorophyll necessary for photosynthesis.  

At the end of his PhD, World War II had begun and Puck remained at Chicago as a research associate to work with Dr. O.H. Robertson on the potential of polyethylene vapor to kill airborne microorganisms for the Commission on Airborne Infections of the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army. The relevance of this project during wartime was exemplified by Puck publishing five papers in Science and six papers in J Exp Med on this work. While on this project, he worked with Phil Marcus, a master&amp;#39;s student who would later join him in Colorado. 

After the war, Puck did formal postdoctoral work on the genetics and kinetics of bacteriophage interactions with bacteria at the California Institute of Technology with Max Delbrück, who later shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Alfred Hershey and Salvador Luria (yes, Luria broth). Delbrück was originally a physicist and obviously contributed to Puck&amp;#39;s early enthusiasm for &amp;quot;applying physicochemical approaches to problems of biology.&amp;quot;

Clonal populations of mammalian cells

Puck&amp;#39;s work with phage impressed upon him that studying human genetics would require that similar techniques be developed to manipulate human cells. Because HeLa cells were taken from the tumor of Henrietta Lacks, they contained several populations of cancer cells. Puck and his then-graduate student Phil Marcus and Steven Cieciura were trying to figure out how to grow clonal populations from single cells.

Establishing &amp;quot;clones,&amp;quot; or colonies that grew from a single cell, was first accomplished with mouse L929 cells in 1948 by Katherine Sanford and Gwendolyn Likely in the laboratory of Wilton Earle at the National Cancer Institute (JNCI 1948; 9:229). Earle is credited with the isolation and propagation of the first continuously cultured cell line, mouse L cells. This heterogeneous population was originally isolated in October 1940 as an outgrowth of subcutaneous connective tissue from mammary fat pads excised from a 100-day-old C3H/An mouse (JNCI 1943: 4:165). The cells acquired a malignant phenotype in culture and could produce sarcomas when injected back into mice. 

Just as an aside, Earle&amp;#39;s group acknowledged the cell culture work of Lewis (Science 1935; 81:545) and Fischer and Davidsohn (Nature 1939; 143:436). The 1935 paper from Warren H. Lewis was his presidential address to the American Association of Anatomists where he reported the continuous culture of rat sarcoma cells for 2-4 years, although no photographs or formal data were shown. Albert Fischer and Fanja Davidsohn reported carrying mouse adenocarcinoma cells for up to 12 years. But while both Lewis and Fischer had lengthy careers, I&amp;#39;m unable to find any follow-up literature on these respective cell lines. Hence, the most continually documented work of Earle&amp;#39;s group is most deserving of the &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; designation.

Recognizing that L cells came from a heterogeneous cell population, the Earle group worked on isolating single cells and propagating clonal cultures from those cells. At the time, the composition of cell culture medium was not fully refined and attempts at growing out cells from small populations were unsuccessful. Earle&amp;#39;s group recognized that using medium &amp;quot;conditioned&amp;quot; by growing cells produced diffusible factors that encouraged growth of small cell populations. To produce single clones, Earle&amp;#39;s group painstakingly transferred single L cells to small capillary tubes together with a small amount of conditioned medium, producing the first clonal cultures of immortalized mammalian cells.  The most widely studied of these is clone 929, known more properly as NCTC L-929 cells, the first immortal mammalian cell line offered by ATCC, appropriately as CCL-1.

The capillary approach to cloning seemed too cumbersome to Puck and he wanted to develop a method that was more analogous to isolating clonal bacteria cultures from distinct colonies that had grown from individual cells. Moreover, quantitative assessment of cellular sensitivity to drugs or radiation would not be possible using the capillary method. Because he was interested in human genetics, he decided to work with HeLa cells.  As cited below in references 1 and 2, he obtained his original HeLa culture from the George Washington Carver Foundation of historically black institution, Tuskegee University in Alabama, rather than from George Gey at Hopkins who had originally isolated the cells.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you start with a lizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, I’m not joking. Snakes didn’t just appear out of nowhere, nor was there simply some massive cosmic zot of a mutation in some primordial legged ancestor that turned their progeny into slithery limbless serpents. One of the tougher lessons to get across to people is that evolution is not about abrupt transmutations of one form into another, but the gradual accumulation of many changes at the genetic level which are typically buffered and have minimal effects on the phenotype, only rarely expanding into a lineage with a marked difference in morphology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means in a practical sense is that if you take a distinct form of a modern clade, such as the snakes, and you look at a distinctly different form in a related clade, such as the lizards, what you may find is that the differences are resting atop a common suite of genetic changes; that snakes, for instance, are extremes in a range of genetic possibilities that are defined by novel attributes shared by all squamates (squamates being the lizards and snakes together). Lizards are not snakes, but they will have inherited some of the shared genetic differences that enabled snakes to arise from the squamate last common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you want to know where snakes came from, the right place to start is to look at their nearest cousins, the lizards, and ask what snakes and lizards have in common, that is at the same time different from more distant relatives, like mice, turtles, and people…and then you’ll have an idea of the shared genetic substrate that can make a snake out of a lizard-like early squamate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, one obvious place to look is at the pattern of the Hox genes. Hox genes are primary regulators of the body plan along the length of the animal; they are expressed in overlapping zones that specify morphological regions of the body, such as cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral/pelvic, and caudal mesodermal tissues, where, for instance, a thoracic vertebra would have one kind of shape with associated ribs, while lumbar vertebra would have a different shape and no ribs. These identities are set up by which Hox genes are active in the tissue forming the bone. And that’s what makes the Hox genes interesting in this case: where the lizard body plan has a little ribless interruption to form pelvis and hindlimbs, the snake has vertebra and ribs that just keep going and going. There must have been some change in the Hox genes (or their downstream targets) to turn a lizard into a snake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four overlapping sets of Hox genes in tetrapods, named a, b, c, and d. Each set has up to 13 individual genes, where 1 is switched on at the front of the animal and 13 is active way back in the tail. This particular study looked at just the caudal members, 10-13, since those are the genes whose expression patterns straddle the pelvis and so are likely candidates for changes in the evolution of snakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a summary diagram of the morphology and patterns of Hox gene expression in the lizard (left) and snake (right). Let’s see what we can determine about the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center;font-size:11px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f4.2.php" rel="external "&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f4.2-thumb-400x294-42856.jpg" alt="nature08789-f4.2.jpg" width="400" height="294"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evolutionary modifications of the posterior Hox system in the whiptail lizard and corn snake. The positions of Hox expression domains along the paraxial mesoderm of whiptail lizard (32-40 somites, left) and corn snake (255-270 somites, right) are represented by black (Hox13), dark grey (Hox12), light grey (Hox11) and white (Hox10) bars, aligned with coloured schemes of the future vertebral column. Colours indicate the different vertebral regions: yellow, cervical; dark blue, thoracic; light blue, lumbar; green, sacral (in lizard) or cloacal (in snake); red, caudal. Hoxc11 and Hoxc12 were not analysed in the whiptail lizard. Note the absence of Hoxa13 and Hoxd13 from the corn snake mesoderm and the absence of Hoxd12 from the snake genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morphology is revealing: snakes and lizards have the same regions, cervical (yellow), thoracic (blue), sacral (or cloacal in the snake, which lacks pelvic structures in most species) in green, and caudal or tail segments (red). The differences are in quantity — snakes make a lot of ribbed thoracic segments — and detail — snakes don’t make a pelvis, usually, but do have specializations in that corresponding area for excretion and reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where it really gets interesting is in the expression patterns of the Hox genes, shown with the bars that illustrate the regions where each Hox gene listed is expressed. They are largely similar in snake and lizard, with boundaries of Hox expression that correspond to transitions in the morphology of vertebrae. But there are revealing exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare a10/c10 in the snake and lizard. In the snake, these two genes have broader expression patterns, reaching up into the thoracic region; in the lizard, they are cut off sharply at the sacral boundary. This is interesting because in other vertebrates, the Hox 10 group is known to have the function of &lt;em&gt;suppressing&lt;/em&gt; rib formation. Yet there they are, turned on in the posterior portion of the thorax in the snake, where there are ribs all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the snake, then, Hox a10 and c10 have lost a portion of their function — they no longer shut down ribs. What is the purpose of the extended domain of a10/c10 expression? It may not have one. A comparison of the sequences of these genes between various species reveals a detectable &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of signs of selection — the reason these genes happen to be active so far anteriorly is because selection has been relaxed, probably because they’ve lost that morphological effect of shutting down ribs. Those big bars are a consequence of simple sloppiness in a system that can afford a little slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next group of Hox genes, the 11 group, are very similar in their expression patterns in the lizard and the snake, and that reflects their specific roles. The 10 group is largely involved in repression of rib formation, but the 11 group is involved in the development of sacrum-specific structures. In birds, for instance, the Hox 11 genes are known to be involved in the development of the cloaca, a structure shared between birds, snakes, and lizards, so perhaps it isn’t surprising that they aren’t subject to quite as much change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 13 group has some notable differences: Hox a13 and d13 are mostly shut off in the snake. This is suggestive. The 13 group of Hox genes are the last genes, at the very end of the animal, and one of their proposed functions is to act as a terminator of patterning — turning on the Hox 13 genes starts the process of shutting down the mesoderm, shrinking the pool of tissue available for making body parts, so removing a repressor of mesoderm may promote longer periods of growth, allowing the snake to extend its length further during embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we see a couple of clear correlates at the molecular level for differences in snake and lizard morphology: rib suppression has been lost in the snake Hox 10 group, and the activity of the snake Hox 13 group has been greatly curtailed, which may be part of the process of enabling greater elongation. What are the similarities between snakes and lizards that are also different from other animals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting surprise. There are some differences in Hox gene organization in the squamates as a whole, shared with both snakes and lizards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center;font-size:11px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f1.2.php" rel="external "&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/nature08789-f1.2-thumb-400x212-42847.jpg" alt="nature08789-f1.2.jpg" width="400" height="212"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genomic organization of the posterior HoxD cluster. Schematic representation of the posterior HoxD cluster (from Evx2 to Hoxd10) in various vertebrate species. A currently accepted phylogenetic tree is shown on the left. The correct relative sizes of predicted exons (black boxes), introns (white or coloured boxes) and intergenic regions (horizontal thick lines) permit direct comparisons (right). Gene names are shown above each box. Colours indicate either a 1.5-fold to 2.0-fold (blue) or a more than 2.0-fold (red) increase in the size of intronic (coloured boxes) or intergenic (coloured lines) regions, in comparison with the chicken reference. Major CNEs are represented by green vertical lines: light green, CNEs conserved in both mammals and sauropsids; dark green, CNEs lost in the corn snake. Gaps in the genomic sequences are indicated by dotted lines. Transposable elements are indicated with asterisks of different colours (blue for DNA transposons; red for retrotransposons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a diagram of the structure of the chromosome in the neighborhood of the Hox d10-13 genes in various vertebrates. For instance, look at the human and the turtle: the layout of our Hox d genes is vary similar, with 13-12-11-10 laid out with approximately the same distances between them, and furthermore, there are conserved non-coding elements, most likely important pieces of regulatory DNA, that are illustrated in light yellow-reen and dark green vertical bars, and they are the same, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the genes that stake out the locations of pelvic and tail structures in turtles and people are pretty much the same, using the same regulatory apparatus. It must be why they both have such pretty butts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now compare those same genes with the squamates, geckos, anoles, slow-worms, and corn snakes. The differences are huge: something happened in the ancestor of the squamates that released this region of the genome from some otherwise highly conserved constraints. We don’t know what, but in general regulation of the Hox genes is complex and tightly interknit, and this order of animals acquired some other as yet unidentified patterning mechanism that opened up this region of genome for wider experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these regions are compared in animals like turtles and people and chickens, the genomes reveal signs of purifying selection — that is, mutations here tend to be unsuccessful, and lead to death, failure to propagate, etc., other horrible fates that mean tinkering here is largely unfavorable to fecundity (which makes sense: who wants a mutation expressed in their groinal bits?). In the squamates, the evidence in the genome does not witness to intense selection for their particular arrangement, but instead, of &lt;em&gt;relaxed&lt;/em&gt; selection — they are generally more tolerant of variations in the Hox gene complex in this area. What was found in those enlarged intergenic regions is a greater invasion of degenerate DNA sequences: lots of additional retrotransposons, like LINES and SINES, which are all junk DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So squamates have more junk in the genomic trunk, which is not necessarily expressed as an obvious phenotypic difference, but still means that they can more flexibly accommodate genetic variations in this particular area. Which means, in turn, that they have the potential to produce more radical experiments in morphology, like making a snake. The change in Hox gene regulation in the squamate ancestor did not immediately produce a limbless snake, instead it was an enabling mutation that opened the door to novel variations that did not compromise viability.&lt;/p&gt;

So when Dean was accepted to Harvard, being a major Thoreau fan, he endeavored to find out what room in the Freshmen Halls (at Harvard, "Hall" = "Dorm" for Freshmen, "House" = "Dorm" for Sophomores and beyond), was  Thoreau's.

A few things are going on here in Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could attend this panel discussion on the &lt;a href="http://www.stmarkscamberwell.org.au/pages/posts/the-resurrection-of-theism206.php"&gt;"Science and God: Incompatible?"&lt;/a&gt;, just because it's stacked with Christian apologists who will no doubt be annoyingly superficial, and because it was the topic of my lecture at the GAC (my answer: yes. Incompatible, irreconcilable, and dear sweet baby Jebus, keep your superstitions away from the grownups). It's at the  St James Conference Centre, 12 Batman St, West Melbourne, tonight at 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm skipping it, though, because I'd rather attend a &lt;a href="http://ict4lifesciences.org.au/"&gt;lecture by Craig Venter&lt;/a&gt; tonight, at 6 in the Melbourne Convention Center. Evidence-based reasoning always wins over old farts exercising in wishful thinking in a church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And tomorrow afternoon, Thursday, I'm going to try and drop in on the &lt;a href="http://www.umss.org/archives/2010/03/16/answers-to-creationist-nonsense/"&gt;University of Melbourne Secular Society's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=367761436323&amp;amp;ref=mf"&gt;dissection of creationism&lt;/a&gt; and specifically of Ray Comfort's bad introduction to the &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt;. That's at 1:00 in Theatre 4, the Alan Gilbert Building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm spending my weekend in Canberra, and I will be giving a talk to &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=350008757910&amp;amp;ref=mf"&gt;Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt; at 12:00 on Saturday, in King O&amp;#39;Malley&amp;#39;s Irish Pub, 131 City Walk. I haven&amp;#39;t quite decided what I&amp;#39;ll be talking about yet, though — I&amp;#39;ll probably sort that out on the plane on Friday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/my_remaining_plans_to_conquer.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/n0UOthweYGQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268792308058"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/bad_bad_media.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/22600c564b14ba3f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Bad, bad media</title><published>2010-03-16T23:06:30Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T23:06:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/4ILL2vKGm2Q/bad_bad_media.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/bad_bad_media.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The media are lashing back. The post-&lt;a href="http://www.atheistconvention.org.au/?wp_ct=1"&gt;convention&lt;/a&gt; media (with the exception of &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/celebrating-life-beyond-belief/story-e6frg6z6-1225840634149"&gt;one article in the Australian&lt;/a&gt;) has been abysmally bad, relying on tried-and-true excuse-making from religious apologists. It would be nice if they actually had conversations with atheists rather than immediately running to the nearest cathedral for consolation, but I guess that's what they have to do now. After all, the convention was an unqualified success, a real triumph for the atheist movement, and they just can't have that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/blogs/the-religious-write/atheists-ridicule-wont-win-friends-and-influence-people/20100315-q9wj.html"&gt;Barney Zwartz is a concern troll&lt;/a&gt;. He's a believer; he presumably thinks religion and god and all that crap have some value; so why is he trying to give us advice on how to make atheism more effective?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's my advice. If atheists can reduce their contempt for believers and work harder for their positive goal -- reducing the footprint of religion in society -- they may begin to exert more of the influence they feel they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, Barney. Here's my advice for you: put away the writing career, join a monastery, and pray, pray, pray. It will advance your cause!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, why should a believer trust my advice on this issue? I want you to go away. It's the same with Zwartz. Complain away, at least that's being honest about your own opinions; but playing the game of offering grandfatherly advice to a movement you detest is insincere and obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and what you consider unworthy doesn't interest me much. Explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also unworthy were ABC science presenter Robyn Williams offering "a devastating argument against religion in two words: Senator Fielding"; former Hillsong member Tanya Levin: "I'm finally getting to hang out with the adults"; and Rationalist Society president Ian Robinson, asking whether there were any believers in the audience. "OK, I'll speak really slowly."  (Wild applause after each.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What was missing was any sign of self-deprecation.  Atheism will be a mature movement in Australia when atheists can laugh not just at the religious, but at themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, you could try to defend &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/episode_xxxix_play_spot_the_mo.php"&gt;Fielding&lt;/a&gt; — that would be interesting. Fielding is the fellow who believes the earth is 6000 years old, after all, because his religion tells him so. The religious should be embarrassed by him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for laughing at ourselves…we did. There was quite a bit of humor aimed at our own little group. It&amp;#39;s just that the wacky, goofy religious nuts are &lt;i&gt;so much funnier&lt;/i&gt;. Religion will be a mature movement when it can stop providing so much juicy material for comedians, although, given that you've been struggling with that problem for a few millennia, I don't offer much hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of jokes, here's a punchline for you: &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/dawkins-preaches-to-the-deluded-against-the-divine/story-e6frg6zo-1225841086925"&gt;Melanie Phillips&lt;/a&gt;. She's the deranged religious nut who rants and raves about atheists being totalitarian fundamentalists, and who is now making a career out of her hatred of Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just why is he so angry and why does he hate religion so much? After all, as many religious scientists can attest, science and religion are — contrary to his claim — not incompatible at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A clue lies in his insistence that a principal reason for believing that there could be no intelligence behind the origin of life is that the alternative — God — is unthinkable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melanie Phillips was not actually at the Global Atheist Convention. I specifically addressed her argument about compatibility from propinquity — it just doesn&amp;#39;t work, because it means that everything must be compatible with everything else in the most trivial way. I also have not heard Dawkins ever claim that God is unthinkable, or that there is no possibility of intelligence responsible for the origin of life — quite the contrary, these &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; possible alternatives which we simply reject because there is no evidence for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's always a bad sign when the only way you can make a point is by lying about what the other person said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phillips is always a source of amusement, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through such hubristic overreach, Dawkins has opened himself up to attack from quarters that, unlike the theologians he routinely knocks around the park, he cannot so easily disdain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Books taking his arguments apart on his own purported ground of scientific reason have been published by a growing number of eminent scientists and philosophers, including mathematicians David Berlinski and John Lennox, biochemist Alister McGrath, geneticist Francis Collins, and philosopher and recanting atheist Anthony Flew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, yes. We can easily disdain them. Berlinski, Lennox, and McGrath are not serious contributors to the debate; Berlinski is a popinjay and Lennox and McGrath are wacky theologians. Collins' arguments for religion are fallacious and trivial, and Flew is in a sad state of senility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the worst. ABC news spent half their brief coverage with shots of a communion ritual at a church, and got some smug idiot in a dog collar named Philip Freier to give his opinion of atheism, and got it all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/aYnyzdEHnZU%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the priest's brainfart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It will be interesting to me to see how something that is framed around a largely negative concept, &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;theism &amp;lt;self-satisfied smile&amp;gt;, is capable of developing a coherent position.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong, wrong, wrong. The central concept of modern atheism is the importance of evidence. We have seen the remarkable success of evidence-based reasoning, and have noticed that religion doesn&amp;#39;t seem to use it…that the only negative concept here is the fundamental premise of religion, faith. Evidence and reason are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; negative concepts, except perhaps in the minds of faith-heads who have replaced them with a vacuum and gullibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also been waiting a long, long time for religion to develop a coherent position. Their failure so far suggests that they are incapable of doing so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/bad_bad_media.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/4ILL2vKGm2Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268792063803"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=4826">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc1bb47291f7edbd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Senate Committee approves nominations for National Council on Disability</title><published>2010-03-16T23:33:18Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T23:33:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/oU4qPb8wqI8/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268791985732"><id gr:original-id="http://takluyver.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/on-the-evolution-of-toilets/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29b1a02bbc412ccc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">On the evolution of toilets</title><published>2010-03-16T19:55:28Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T19:55:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/oi0TV9Nz9nQ/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://takluyver.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/on-the-evolution-of-toilets/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Just when you think you’ve seen it all, you learn about something completely unexpected.

Briefly put, MH is a non-peer-reviewed journal that publishes original, controversial and thought-provoking ideas ("hypotheses" defined in the broadest possible sense, I guess you could say) about the medical realm sensu lato. Now, as reported by Science Insider, MH's editor, Bruce Charlton (here's his blog presenting his position on this affair), has all but been been fired as lead editor of the journal (unless MH is completely reorganized), mainly as a result of the brouhaha and subsequent fall-out over MH having accepted to publish a paper denying the link between HIV and AIDS. Indeed, some have gone so far as to wonder whether MH might be labeled "the most hated journal in science."Orac provides a thoughtful dissection of some of the problems with MH and of the impact of publishing some of what was published in that venue in recent years. I doubt I could do much better than that in terms of providing background and context to the 'regime change' underway at MH. That said, I figured I'd throw out my two cents about this, given two things: 1) I've recently published something in MH; 2) what it means for the public understanding of scientific arguments; and 3) Elsevier's role in all this.First, two years ago, a short commentary of mine was published in MH (Riel-Salvatore 2008), I hasten to add in response to a paper they had published, which I felt was very poorly argued and completely unsupported by the available data (Underdown 2008). To MH's credit, the process of publishing my reply was very smooth, transparent and, importantly, very quick. My comment was based on a post I first had up on AVRPI, a process I chronicled in detail before, and it took all of three months from the blog-to-published-comment process to unfold, which I was personally quite happy about. Likewise, I have to say that my impression throughout this process was that MH was quite open to even very 'vigorous' criticism of papers it published. It was also nice that you didn't have to pay to publish a comment, whereas you have to pay 'page fees' to publish an actual paper in MH (itself a questionable practice, especially if it doesn't result in open access to the paper in question, but that's another post for another time).That said, there was a good reason why I felt the need to publish that comment, even though, as a non-peer reviewed piece on a non-peer reviewed piece, it was essentially a double net loss to my research productivity, especially since I had no personal stake in this, i.e, it didn't portray any of my own work negatively. That reason was the amount of play the original paper had received in the popular press. And this, fundamentally, is the issue I have with journals like MH. To the public at large, reading that a 'study' or a 'new paper' has been published in a 'journal' (especially if it is by someone described as a professor or researcher affiliated with a bona fide university), implies that it is a serious contribution to the literature on given debates. In this case, the 'mad Neanderthal' meme as a credible explanation for their disappearance went full-steam ahead, with no real detractors on the record. I suspect that this acceptance was due in no small part to the fact that it had been published in a 'journal', never mind the facts that authors basically need to pay to have their research published in MH, with no resulting public access, and the that, contrarily to most research on Neanderthals that makes its way to the popular press, this paper was not critically evaluated by peers of the author. This is not to say that non-peer reviewed publications don't have their own raison d'être, but rather that they need to be explicitly recognized as such, especially before results published in such sources get fed to the media.As it is, to the non-specialist, MH certainly has the appearance of a peer-reviewed journal. For one thing, it's a 'journal.' For another, it's published by Elsevier, which touts itself as "the world’s leading publisher of science and health information" (from their website). With such backing, why wouldn't someone assume that MH is a reputable source? It's even got 'medical' right there in the title! Hell, I hadn't heard of MH before reading Underdown's paper, and my first reaction upon seeing it was an Elsevier pub certainly was that it was most likely a peer-reviewed journal. Plus, as this post's inclusion on Research Blogging shows, it even has a doi and everything, making the contents of MH appear as legitimate peer-reviewed publications, as does their inclusion in scientific databases like Web of Science. This is not to exculpate people who don't do their homework, but MH certainly has all the outside appearance of a peer-reviewed publication.This leads to the third point, namely the business practices of Elsevier, who bought MH in 2002 (the journal was created in 1975). I think an important question to ask is why Elsevier bothered to acquire MH in the first place? Given its current double-take on MH's worth as a scientific publication, it kind of makes one wonder whether the goal of dominating as much of the scientific publishing market as possible made the higher-ups at Elsevier ignore the nature of that journal in their continuing efforts to take over an increasing share of the publishing world, no matter what the costs... I very much doubt that they had as their ultimate goal to make MH into a full-blown peer-reviewed publication (if so, why wait 8 years?), so what's the story here? I think we may be witnessing an instance of Elsevier's business model backfiring, and though they're clearly trying to shift the fall-out solely on MH, I think it ultimately highlights the hypocrisy that grows from the tensions between the mission of scientific publication and the business realities faced by publishing conglomerates within which individuals become increasingly faceless entities conceived more as profit-making devices than conduits for the wide and timely dissemination of scientific knowledge. I think this is all the more grating given that scientists are essentially forced to give away their work to be published in the 'right' Elsevier journals - and those of other large publishing companies - (even if in many cases their reputation far precedes their incorporation by Elsevier) for purposes of getting tenure, professional prestige, etc.In any case, my point here is not to say that MH is all sorts of awesome and that Elsevier isn't. In fact, my only involvement with MH came as a reaction to a paper that I thought was of pretty low academic quality (which echoes some of the problems that precipitated the current fiasco) and which they nonetheless elected to publish, even though it echoed another short paper written almost 35 years prior (Wolbarsht 1975). It also isn't that it is not a peer-reviewed journal - even Nature publishes some non-peer reviewed comments that are downright wretched (see a nice takedown here)and which I'm sure the yahoos who write them bandy about as "publications in Nature!" (hey they have doi's and issue/page numbers and everything!). Rather, I think that this whole situation points to some systemic problems in academic publishing, especially as practiced by large conglomerates increasingly detached from the goals and individual realities of the given journals they...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should point out – the ratio at the Global Atheist Convention was nine women, fourteen men – both Stuart Bechman and I shared the MC duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/atheism-is-a-broad-church-20100316-qclu.html"&gt;The Age – Atheism is a Broad Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There weren’t enough women in the line-up. But the percentage and the gravitas of tasks given to them was far greater than usual.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, there was a ”women’s panel”. But Sue-Ann Post was the opening act, and I was the closing act on the opening night. And Taslima Nasrin, who now lives in exile due to religious persecution, was a highlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Educator and sceptic Kylie Sturgess introduced Dawkins to the stage. I wondered how many times he’d been introduced by a woman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leslie Cannold and Jane Caro and I have decided to address the common refrain of ”We couldn’t find any women to speak” by setting up a website called No Chicks No Excuse, with a list of women speakers on diverse topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the entire article to catch her summation of the whole conference – for the win! &lt;img src="http://podblack.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should point out that at the after-party, Prof Richard Dawkins offered to feature her article that was ’spiked’ on his website. I hope that they’ve got in touch with each other – her article features here: &lt;a href="http://catherinedeveny.com/wordpress/?page_id=526"&gt;Christian Values&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this story interesting and or a little sad is that Joseph a prior, “associate of the year” suffers from sinus cancer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an inoperable brain tumor. Joseph had been prescribed marijuana to help cope with his disease and had a state issued drug card that showed he was a legal medical marijuana user. He showed that card at his place of work and they showed him his test results and then they showed him the door.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/376/stonern.jpg" alt="stoner" width="432" height="270"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yeah, that kinda makes Wal-Mart look like an evil empire doesn’t it? But wait, medical marijuana though considered legal in some states is still considered illegal by the federal government. And shouldn’t a company have the right to have a drug free policy at work? The guy had to have known he could be randomly drug tested, right? He had to agree to those terms at hire. And what is the deal with medical marijuana anyway? Do you have any idea how easy it is to get a medical marijuana card in the states that issue them? Trust me it’s easy. Let’s just say that you definitely don’t need to have cancer. While some people may actually receive benefit from the effects of cannabis, I am pretty darn sure that an even larger population is indulging for purely recreational reasons while calling it medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think? Was Wal-Mart wrong for firing this employee? Should companies in states that allow medicinal marijuana be allowed to tell employees that they can’t smoke on or off the job? Or should we just legalize it altogether and quit playing alt-med marijuana card games?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bora has made extensive comments on the paper that I recommend (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/science_blogs_and_public_engag.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and as usual, Bora has done an excellent job linking to all the other stuff on the blogosphere about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I avoided commenting on the paper is that I didn't like it a whole lot, but did not want to get into a huge blog fight about it.  I have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/science/framing_science/"&gt;mixed feelings about the communications field &lt;/a&gt;as it is, and I'm not sure sometimes if what I'm looking at is intellectually or academically unsatisfying or if I'm just not tuning in correctly to the material.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the paper has been discussed widely enough that I thought you should know about it.  The link above will get you to the original.  My main two reactions to the paper are: 1) The sampling (which blogs are looked at) is not what I would have done; and 2) I find it fascinating that a communications paper about the blogosphere would not site the relevant blogging about the topic, and stick entirely to academic journal articles.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've lost track of who, but someone out there suggested that this paper would be more valuable as a commentary than as a peer reviewed paper.  Maybe.  But if you read Bora's post on it, you'll see that the problem here was not the peer review process or the peer review context, but rather, the apparent failure of the journal editor(s) to apply the reviews that were carried out. &lt;/p&gt;

Whilst not exactly common, rocks with ages up to about 3.5 billion years old are found at multiple points on the Earth&amp;#39;s surface. However, rocks older than this are much less common. Extensive outcrops older than about 3.8 billion years are exceptionally rare, possibly because a series of very large meteorite impacts prior to this time - the Late Heavy Bombardment - largely destroyed any older bits of crust.  The Acasta Gneiss in northern Canada, dated at around 4.03 billion (4030 million) years, is generally regarded as the oldest known outcrop of crust, although a recent study has claimed that the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt, also in northern Canada, may be as old as 4280 million years. The only known bits of the Earth that are older are 4.2-4.4 billion year-old zircon crystals found in the Jack Hills Conglomerate in Australia; the conglomerate itself was deposited about 3 billion years ago, but it contains debris eroded from much older, and now long-vanished, bits of crust.

Two or three data points is not a hell of a lot to go on when trying to reconstruct the evolution of the early Earth, especially when the material involved is far from pristine (the Acasta Gneiss, being a gneiss. has been partially remelted, for example). It is therefore no surprise that the geological timescale for the period between the Earth&amp;#39;s formation, about 4.56 billion years ago, and the start of the Archean Eon, usually pegged at about 3.8 billion years ago, is rather lacking in detail. This period is usually referred to as the &amp;#39;Hadean&amp;#39;, which is more of a reference to the presumed conditions on the Earth&amp;#39;s surface than a subtle pointer to the fact that we don&amp;#39;t know what the hell was really going on. 

However, this has not stopped Colin Goldblatt and his co-authors having a go at adding a bit more structure to the Earth&amp;#39;s earliest days - and beyond. The &amp;#39;Chaotian&amp;#39; eon at the start of their proposed new timescale begins with the first gravitational collapse of the gas cloud that would eventually form the solar system, with key events - such as the initiation of solar fusion, or the first interactions between sizeable protoplanets that condensed from the protoplanetary disk - marking the boundaries between different eras and periods within it. The start of the Hadean itself is marked by the collision of the proto-Earth, which the authors call Tellus, with another Mars-sized protoplanet, forming the Earth-Moon system.  

Proposed new timescale for the formation of the solar system (Chaotian) and the evolution of the early Earth (Hadean). Click for a larger image

Thus, the Chaotian marks the time when solar system first became a distinct entity from the galactic neighbourhood; the beginning of the Hadean is when the Earth&amp;#39;s geological history begins to be shaped as much by internal processes, such as mantle convection, as by external events such as collisions with other protoplanets, 

Similarly, from beginning of the Archean, at the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment, internal processes start to completely dominate the Earth&amp;#39;s geological evolution; extraterrestrial collisions can still have significant geochemical and biological impacts, but they no longer melt the entire crust. Conceptually, I find this quite a nice way of looking at it.

The authors also attempt to subdivide the Hadean, but because we still don&amp;#39;t understand the key events in the Earth&amp;#39;s geological events over this period, it&amp;#39;s not quite as successful. The Hephaestean period probably covers the recovery from the Moon-forming impact. The Jacobian, Canadian and Acastan periods refer to the Jack Hills zircons, Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt and Acasta Gneiss, respectively, but although these outcrops can give us clues about what the Earth was like when they first formed, it is a bit risky to try to characterise an entire planetary system from one sampling point. For example, the Jack Hills zircons tell us that granite - in other words, continental crust - was forming 4.4 billion years ago, but this is only a minimum age; we have no evidence that it wasn&amp;#39;t forming before that. Also, for all we know greenstone belts were also forming at exactly the same time, and have just not been preserved. The small amount of data we have available means that a single new outcrop might force the entire timescale to be redrafted.

It&amp;#39;s difficult to know if we&amp;#39;re ever going to be able to construct a truly robust, process based timescale for the first 700 million years of Earth&amp;#39;s history, because it&amp;#39;s unclear how much we&amp;#39;ll ever truly know about the Hadean. Still, this is an interesting attempt to set the story of our planet&amp;#39;s birth into a slightly more structured framework.

&lt;p&gt;The must-read of the day is Ed Yong's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2010/03/the_value_of_this_is_cool_science_stories.php" title=""&gt;The value of 'this is cool' science stories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But for now, as newspapers decline and shrink, the worry is that the internet will only cater for established interests. As Colin asks, "All of my interviews have pointed out that strong story and strong characters can get someone to read your science story, but what if they don't open the section?" 

&lt;p&gt;Opening a section, of course, is an example of "pull marketing", where users and consumers yank in the information that they actively demand. But the internet's strengths will increasingly rely on "push marketing" where people foist material towards consumers. This isn't just about traditional paid advertising. Social media ensures that we are all each others' editors and advertisers. Through email, Facebook, Twitter, Delicious, Buzz and more, we shove content into the attentional spotlights of our contacts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is an area where "this-is-cool" stories really excel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Roston joins in the discussion with &lt;a href="http://carbonnation.org/2010/03/16/though-experiment-new-journalism-division-of-labor.aspx" title=""&gt;Thought Experiment: New Journalism Division of Labor&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's widely understood and celebrated that the categories "journalist" and "blogger" are insufficient to capture the richness and opportunity--really, the once-in-five-centuries revolution--that electronic media bring to civic discourse and investigation of people in power (including journalists and bloggers). After this year's Science Online conference, I started wondering, though, how can we think about divisions of labor within a new media environment that so frequently has all the discernible sub-structures of a bowl of soup? For efficiency, I am condensing the words "journalist" and "blogger" into "jogger."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is j-schools that are most resistant to change, mis-educating their charges? Dave Taylor had a telling experience: &lt;a href="http://www.intuitive.com/blog/class_of_cu_journalism_seniors_only_one_was_blogging.html" title=""&gt;A class of CU journalism seniors, and only one was blogging?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ultimately, it was an interesting conversation, but it's been a while since I felt like I was in the position of defending what I see as the natural evolution of media and journalism. As I feared, my impression of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication remains that it's a dinosaur bellowing furiously at the impending climate change, it's King Canute standing on the beach yelling "Ocean, be thou still! I bid thee come not nearer to my feet!" even as the waves implacably roll in.

&lt;p&gt;The world of information dissemination is evolving before our eyes, going from four channels of television to hundreds to thousands, from one or two major newspapers per community to dozens, and from mainstream outlets to everything being an outlet. Journalism is surely just as much about speed of dissemination as it is digging up the muck (a relatively modern invention in the journalistic world, btw), so Twitter users breaking the news of the Chilean earthquake way before any news outlets do is a harbinger of the future, not a monster to be feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Switek wrote two long and very useful posts for anyone considering writing a popular science book - worth reading and saving: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2010/03/so_you_want_to_write_a_pop-sci.php" title=""&gt;So you want to write a pop-sci book, Part 1: From idea to agent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2010/03/so_you_want_to_write_a_pop-sci_1.php" title=""&gt;So you want to write a pop-sci book, Part 2: The value of blogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a little older, but I did not see it until today, still relevant: &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/02/climategate_distortions/" title=""&gt;Journalistic malpractice on global warming &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since I've advocated a more explicit use of the word "lie", I'll go ahead and follow my own advice: that Daily Mail headline is a lie.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I asked (and many people are trying to argue more than answer) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/what_if_journalism.php" title=""&gt;What is Journalism?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/science_journalism_must-reads.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/kRBiP1--l0s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268772979572"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22442">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/393a732bd87f0213</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Abortion"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">A Christian Solution to the Health Care Crisis</title><published>2010-03-16T20:00:57Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T20:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/16/a-christian-solution-to-the-health-care-crisis/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don’t like your current insurance or the proposed government solution to the health care crisis? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPR’s &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Brady&lt;/strong&gt; has a story on what a group of Evangelical Christians are doing about it: &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124544505"&gt;pooling their health costs and paying for each other’s health care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
James Lansberry, the vice president of &lt;a href="http://www.samaritanministries.org/"&gt;Samaritan Ministries&lt;/a&gt;, says the concept is simple. First there’s a $170 annual fee to cover Samaritan’s administrative costs. His nonprofit group then compiles members’ health care bills and tells its 14,000 households where to send their monthly checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The money doesn’t get received at our central office — it goes directly from one family to another,” Lansberry says. “So each month I send my monthly share of $285 directly to another family.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some rules, of course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to be Christian.  And your Pastor has to sign off on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No money will be used to pay for an abortion.  (What about in the case of ectopic pregnancies?  I can’t find that information.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you got a sexually transmitted disease from outside your marriage, you’re out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in exchange, there’s no guarantee you’ll get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a &lt;a href="http://www.samaritanministries.org/works/index.php"&gt;visual guide&lt;/a&gt; to how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.samaritanministries.org/works/index.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Picture-1.png" alt="" title="Samaritan" width="439" height="641"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, this is not an insurance plan.  If you’re on this, you’re foregoing insurance and relying on the gifts of others to cover your needs.  And those gifts may not be there when you need them the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15128/SMI_Guidelines.pdf"&gt;guidelines also seem sketchy&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).  They won’t cover a variety of special needs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
11. Mental Illness — Expenses from treating mental illness are not publishable, including bills for mental, emotional, spiritual, psychological or psychiatric tests, or treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. ADD, ADHD and SPD — Psychotropic medication, to treat chemical imbalances not demonstrable by lab tests, for Attention Deficit Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Sensory Processing Disorder and similar disorders are not publishable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, if there’s any problem you have with them, you waive your right to ever take them to court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t get why anyone would want to buy into this system.  It just sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many problems as the insurance industry has, Samaritan doesn’t seem to provide the fixes.  It just isolates these Christians even more from other people — just like Jesus would have wanted?  — and only offers hope that your needs will be met.  (Isn’t it precisely the kind of “socialized medicine” conservative Christians have been railing against?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure those of you with more knowledge about health care can weigh in more on the benefits/problems with this sort of system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Tina&lt;/strong&gt; for the link)&lt;br&gt;

The man who found it studied geology in college, but is now a systems analyst! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect example of citizen science. There’s too much real estate — on Earth and in the sky — for what we normally think of as geologists and astronomers to examine carefully. And this shows there’s plenty of room for &amp;quot;amateurs&amp;quot; to help out… and that word always makes me laugh. I know a lot of amateur astronomers who know far more than I do about pointing a telescope. You’ll almost always find that at their borders, most definitions are pretty fuzzy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it really captures the best parts of how observing feels.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It misses the not-so-good parts, where the instrument breaks, or you’re shut down for wind in perfectly clear weather, or you’re trying desperately to stay awake on a diet of nothing but reheated bagel dogs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I’m feeling rather maudlin about it, because its now been years and years since I’ve set foot at an observatory.  During the past decade, almost all of my data has been ordered up from satellites or the observing queue, in contrast to my years at Carnegie, where I was observing for more than a month each year.  My scientific life is much more “family friendly” as a result, but I still do miss the cold nights and big skies.&lt;/p&gt;

He is a journalist who has been fighting not just the British Chiropractic Association (who is suing Simon for libel) but also the awful UK libel laws themselves. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2010/03/02/chiropocalypse-book-2/"&gt;You can catch up with all this here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight is actually going well on both fronts, but, sadly, it’s claimed Simon as a victim: it’s eating up so much of his time &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/mar/12/simon-singh-goodbye-libel-reform"&gt;that he can no longer write his monthly column for The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. This is a shame. He’s a great writer and a voice that definitely needs to be heard. He fights the quacks, the antireality brigade, the poor thinkers, and the out-and-out frauds that occupy every crevice of medical altmeddery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, he is pushing for libel reform, and I know his voice overall will not be silenced. Nor will ours. &lt;a href="http://www.libelreform.org/sign"&gt;Give your support for libel reform&lt;/a&gt;, and make sure the forces of darkness don’t win.&lt;/p&gt;

The means of production of these is expensive, thus owned only by wealthy individuals or corporations, or heavily subsidized by such (through advertising and such). One unifying trait of the three technical modes of traditional media is that they are all broadcast media: one-to-many. As such a state of things persisted for several decades and journalism got professionalized during this period, a common cultural definition of journalism emerged: whatever is done by professionals paid by media corporations owned by wealthy individuals or corporations ("if it's in the paper, it's journalism" mindset....including the horoscope, comics, obituaries and ads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, there are &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2009/03/26/flying_seminar.html" title=""&gt;new means of production of media&lt;/a&gt; which are very cheap - everyone with electricity, online access and some kind of gadget (e.g. computer or smart-phone) can produce media. The new methods of communication, the "New Media" is also characterized by the ability for two-way communication: &lt;a href="http://codybrown.name/2009/10/25/a-public-can-talk-to-itself-why-the-future-of-news-is-actually-pretty-clear/" title=""&gt;it is not broadcast any more, but many-to-many&lt;/a&gt;. This fuzzies the definition of journalism in several important ways: a) everyone can do it, b) many do it for free, c) it is a conversation, not a lecture. Journalism has been deprofessionalised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional definition of journalism, the one that held for several decades, does not stand any more. It does not apply to the world in the early 21st century, just as it did not apply to the early 20th century. The long intervening period of certainty as to what journalism is, is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://eliabenari.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/more-on-the-science-journalism-ecosystem-and-what-is-and-is-not-science-journalism/#comment-73" title=""&gt;comment on a blog&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote that the delimiting line of what is and what isn't journalism will be arbitrary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"This all hinges on the definition of "journalism" which is quickly expanding these days to include many forms that did not exist until recently. The natural response by professional journalists is to recoil and to excessively narrow down the definition of journalism to only 'investigative journalism' as that is one last area where they feel they can at least stand on equal ground with millions of amateurs. On the other hand, the over-expansive definition of journalism to equate it with 'communication' (any and all of communication, regardless of the medium, author, if money changes hands, copyright owner, etc.) blurs the question too much.

&lt;p&gt;Where is the dividing line between journalism and non-journalistic communication? I don't know. But wherever it is, it is arbitrary, i.e., something we can fight about, or agree on, but really just a social/cultural decision we need to make."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if the word "arbitrary" was a good choice. What I meant is that the dividing line will be arbitrated by the society at large. The representatives of New and Old Media are pulling the dividing line in two opposite directions. The New Media folks (like me) are trying to expand it to include as much as possible (though probably, maybe or just perhaps not the daily oral conversations, personal e-mails and DMs, your shopping list on a sticky-note, your holiday photographs, or even the crossword-puzzle in the newspaper). The Old Media folks, feeling threatened, are trying to narrow it down. Different people use different criteria for how narrow, or along which axis, but the usual examples, when analyzed to their cores, are narrowing it down to ONLY investigative reporting, ONLY brilliantly stylish writing, ONLY reporting that was paid for by a media company, ONLY stuff that occurs in traditional channels (print, radio, TV), ONLY one-to-many lecturing (as it implies expertise, which many-to-many conversation dispels as a myth), ONLY reporting that pretends to be "objective" (i.e., showing 'both sides'), and/or ONLY reporting that involves interviewing people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, people ("sources" - important term: sources of what? Information, quotes, opinion?) are middle-men to information and they are untrustworthy. Information how the world really works is much more important than what different people think how the world works. Thus showing the (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/why_it_is_important_for_media.php" title=""&gt;link to raw&lt;/a&gt;) data is much more trustworthy than showing quotes (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/the_ethics_of_the_quote.php" title=""&gt;with or without a link&lt;/a&gt; to the full transcript). Especially in science journalism. Journalists focus on people, what they do and what they say. They use that as a proxy for learning about the world. Scientists distrust people and go to the data directly. If journalists did that, adopted the scientific method in their own work, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/09/what_is_investigative_science.php" title=""&gt;science journalism would be much better&lt;/a&gt;. But doing this requires expertise, almost as much as working scientists have. Which means that a good science journalist will a) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/new_science_journalism_ecosyst.php" title=""&gt;specialize&lt;/a&gt; in one broad area of science, b) work closely with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/what_is_journalism_and_do_pios.php" title=""&gt;scientists and PIOs&lt;/a&gt; to get the full scope of information (on top of profuse reading of the primary literature) and c) have their work critiqued and improved by the audience, many of whom are themselves scientific experts in that field. In other words, modern journalism is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/02/journalism_wrap-up_from_scienc.php" title=""&gt;a collaborative endeavor&lt;/a&gt;, not a solitary act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is and what isn't journalism is changing. It is a very fuzzy line right now. It will probably remain fuzzy, but at least the dividing fuzzy line may be centered somewhere so at least extremes will be clearly Yes or No. Where that 'somewhere' will be is something that the society at large will settle down on in the future. It is hard to predict where exactly that will be. But the definition of journalism is not something that we can decree. It will be something that emerges from the practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/what_if_journalism.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ESAHJHl1B70" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268763043070"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-7221315953301140342">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a7eec76719a4b744</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">David Wood vs John W.

This is a fun but crucial part of the book: Chapter Ten, “Recurrent Nightmares.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we (and Boltzmann) only need a judicious medium-strength version of the anthropic principle. Namely, imagine that the real universe is much bigger (in space, or in time, or both) than the part we directly observe. And imagine further that different parts of this bigger universe exist in very different conditions. Perhaps the density of matter is different, or even something as dramatic as different local laws of physics. We can label each distinct region a “universe,” and the whole collection is the “multiverse.” The different universes within the multiverse may or may not be physically connected; for our present purposes it doesn’t matter. Finally, imagine that some of these different regions are hospitable to the existence of life, and some are not. (That part is inevitably a bit fuzzy, given how little we know about “life” in a wider context.) Then—and this part is pretty much unimpeachable—we will always find ourselves existing in one of the parts of the universe where life is allowed to exist, and not in the other parts. That sounds completely empty, but it’s not. It represents a selection effect that distorts our view of the universe as a whole—we don’t see the entire thing, we only see one of the parts, and that part might not be representative.  Boltzmann appeals to exactly this logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the amusing diversions of the last chapter, here we resume again the main thread of argument.  In Chapter Eight we talked a bit about the “reversibility objection” of Lohschmidt to Boltzmann’s attempts to derive the Second Law from kinetic theory in the 1870’s; now we pick up the historical thread in the 1890’s, when a similar controversy broke out over Zermelo’s “recurrence objection.”  The underlying ideas are similar, but people have become a bit more sophisticated over the ensuing 20 years, and the arguments have become a bit more pointed.  More importantly, they are still haunting us today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fun things about this chapter is the extent to which it is driven by direct quotations from great thinkers — Boltzmann, of course, but also Poincare, Nietzsche, Lucretius, Eddington, Feynman.  That’s because the arguments they were making seem perfectly relevant to our present concerns, which isn’t always the case.  Boltzmann tried very hard to defend his derivation of the Second Law, but by now it had sunk in that some additional ingredient was going to be needed — here we’re calling it the Past Hypothesis, but certainly you need &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.  He was driven to float the idea that the universe we see around us (which, to him, would have been our galaxy) was not representative of the wider whole, but was simply a local fluctuation away from equilibrium.  It’s very educational to learn that ideas like “the multiverse” and “the anthropic principle” aren’t recent inventions of a new generation of postmodern physicists, but in fact have been part of respectable scientific discourse for over a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2010/03/figure55.jpg" alt="Boltzmann&amp;#39;s multiverse" title="Boltzmann&amp;#39;s multiverse" width="627" height="260"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s in this chapter that we get to bring up the haunting idea of Boltzmann Brains — observers that fluctuate randomly out of thermal equilibrium, rather than arising naturally in the course of a gradual increase of entropy over billions of years.  I tried my best to explain how such monstrosities &lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt; the correct prediction of a model of an eternal universe with thermal fluctuations, but certainly &lt;em&gt;are not&lt;/em&gt; observers like ourselves, which lets us conclude that that’s not the kind of world we live in.  Hopefully the arguments made sense.  One question people often ask is “how do we know we’re not Boltzmann Brains?”  The realistic answer is that we can never prove that we’re not; but there is no reliable chain of argument that could ever convince us that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, so the only sensible way to act is as if we are not.  That’s the kind of radical foundational uncertainty that has been with us since Descartes, but most of us manage to get through the day without being overwhelmed by existential anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

Dressmaking is like cooking – in the domestic world it’s perceived as the domain of women, but in the professional world the top tailors have traditionally been men. No idea why that is. I myself come from a long line of tailors, and one of my favourite joys as a child was playing with the contents of my grandparents’ expandable sewing box. My own, today, is remarkably similar but sadly I get no time for dressmaking. The most I can achieve is the occasional button re-attachment or sock darn. I don’t even own a sewing machine, but somewhere in my ambitious imagination lurks a competent and lauded amateur dressmaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I saw a tweet from my friend Linzy, aka &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/angryfeet"&gt;@angryfeet&lt;/a&gt;, that she’d come across some rather snazzy stars-and-planets curtains, I immediately suggested turning them into a dress. That’s exactly what I’d have wanted to do with them, but would never have gotten around to it. Linzy is no such daydreamer. She made the dress, and I wanted very much to share it with you guys because frankly it is amazing and ticks all my girlgasm boxes: a) it’s completely unique b) it’s homemade c) it’s CUTE d) it’s so geeky it makes me giggle. Even more delightful is the fact that Linzy was concerned because the pattern is not astronomically correct &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

And now, the write-up:
Chris Mooney: The science has been coming in saying that global warming is real, human-caused, and it keeps getting stronger scientifically.

Chris Mooney is a journalist and the author of the 2009 book, Unscientific America. Mooney spoke about the reasons behind what he calls American inaction on climate change.

Chris Mooney: It’s a problem of politics plus media leading to inability to function on this issue. We’re a divided country and we handle science issues according to politicization and divisiveness, rather than according to what the science actually says.

Mooney pointed to the decline of print media, and the rise of political blogs. He believes good communication of science may now rest with scientists, themselves.

Chris Mooney: The scientific community is going to have to find new ways of getting that information out. Or else it may be the case that we can’t get society to act on the best scientific knowledge that we have. ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/4s14o3slbqnbbtt5h00bhpgldc/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.discovermagazine.com%2Fintersection%2F2010%2F03%2F16%2Fmy-earthsky-podcast-on-americas-scientific-illiteracy-and-climate-change-dysfunctionality%2F" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268757947510"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82addce13b0b2f12</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Hastily Scribbled (And Extremely Late) Notes From The Amazing Adventure, 5 (Volumes II &amp;amp; III)</title><published>2010-03-16T15:08:44Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T15:08:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/906-hastily-scribbled-and-extremely-late-notes-from-the-amazing-adventure-5-volumes-ii-a-iii.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: These would've been posted much earlier if the &lt;/em&gt;Costa Fortuna's &lt;em&gt;WiFi had gotten along even slightly better with Joomla, the software with which we run our website. As it was, we got these things all ready to go and then stared at our computer monitors, waiting for some sign of life from the internets. Such signage was not forthcoming, so these are coming to you late. Sorry about that. To make up for last week's &lt;/em&gt;Swift &lt;em&gt;shortfall, here's a picture of Randi at the beach.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remainder of my diary from &lt;/em&gt;The Amazing Adventure 5 &lt;em&gt;after the jump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we’re docked at Grand Turk. The water is a light and lovely blue outside our cabin window, and we can see a beach flanked by renters’ cottages next to what look like the big boat hangars of a marina. Soon, many JREFers will be snorkeling among the coral patches now surrounding the ship. Not me. Randi, Jeff, Paperskater, Penn Bullock and I will be on the beach, catching rays. (Jeff hints that he has an alternative adventure in mind for those who wish to participate, but he’s a mysterious guy, and has so far skimped on the details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, the Costa Fortuna docked at St. Thomas. I was expecting tacky-touristy; what I got was an idyllic tropical town built in layers scaling a hillside. We bused to “Blackbeard’s Castle” (which is neither Blackbeard’s nor a castle) while Jeff readied a talk on the facts and fictions of Caribbean piracy. Lots of interesting history there, and if you’re kicking around St. Thomas, you can do worse than spend a couple of hours checking out the old Danish tower, built above a fort, which was used in the old days to spot threats miles out at sea. “Blackbeard’s Castle” also features what look like 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;- or 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century manor houses (I’m not sure which, since I didn’t take the tour), a rum factory, a funky little bar, and a big pool with a kickass view of the port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustrative snippet of life on St. Thomas: The fellow who tends bar at “Blackbeard’s Castle” is also the Castle’s resident artist. He showed me his portfolio, and his portraiture is extremely moving. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, and reports that he’s perfectly happy painting in the evening and slinging rum all day. His pictures are sold in Blackbeard’s Gift Shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustrative snippet of life on St. Thomas, part II: One of the complex’s managers told me about a question on the St. Thomas drivers’ license exam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are driving your car and you see someone on the side of the road with whom you’d like to speak, you may stop and converse with them for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A) 1 minute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B) 2 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C) 3 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D) A while&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct answer, apparently, is “D.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we docked at San Juan. Very cool city. Old, European, pastel colors, romantic decay. Full of food, too — the whole place smells like a bakery. It was pouring rain when we disembarked. The boat supplied us with blue plastic panchos, but they were not entirely adequate as we followed Jeff across half a mile of the historic downtown to the old fort on the city’s northeast end. As we filed through the fort’s long entrance tunnel, I heard a low squishing sound; the sound of 80 or so skeptics’ feet sloshing around in soaked shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fort, San Cristobal, is like an architectural palimpsest. It was in use for nearly 500 years and has been built over, decade by decade, to meet the needs of its successive eras. San Cristobal was last active through WWII, so from certain angles you can see 70-year-old radio rooms built atop 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century battlements. Standing on an old barracks in the rain, Jeff gave a brief talk on the fort’s haunted &lt;em&gt;guerite&lt;/em&gt;, or watchtower: “&lt;em&gt;La Guerite del Diablo.&lt;/em&gt;” As the rain let up, Penn Bullock, Richard Orbeck and I set out in search of local flavor. In a single establishment, I found both the best homemade lemonade and the best fish sandwich I’d ever consumed. I wish I could remember the name of the place. It’s an unpretentious lunch counter on San Francisco Street. Look for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JREFers have utterly taken over the outdoor 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor lounge toward the rear of the Costa Fortuna. JREFers reported a whale sighting back there the other day, and those who weren’t spending their afternoons sucking down Caiprinhas missed it entirely. A good argument for daytime boozing. (Alas, Randi and I were in the 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; floor gym, getting ripped.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of young skeptics on this cruise. My guess is that almost 40% of our guests are under 30. The youngification of the skeptical movement becomes more apparent every time we hold one of these big events, and that’s part of the reason we decided to keep this cruise close to home on the relatively inexpensive Costa Fortuna — what our travel guru, Joe Wagg, describes as an “entry level” cruise ship. That’s what must be done to get the Gen Yers into the fold, and it seems to have worked. Our onboard conversations are better for it. Last night, sitting in the cigar lounge, I toggled between a discussion of opera with a 60-ish English libretticist and a political debate with a 20-ish American libertarian. The conversations fused sometime around 1:00 a.m., and by 2:00 had morphed into a free-wheeling exchange of information between six people born in five different decades on three different continents. Very heady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now — to Grand Turk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last day of the cruise. More lectures this morning, then a get-together in the onboard discotheque. Then the rest of the boat will don togas and do whatever it is that one does at a toga party. I will not wear a toga, but I shall try to convince Randi to do so. If I am successful, I will post pictures immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grand Turk yesterday. Randi, Jeff, Paperskater, Penn and I sunbathed about a third of a mile down the beach from the port. Randi hung out for an hour or so and then returned to the ship. In the hours that followed, JREFers gradually made their way to our part of the beach. Jake and Patrick, two rockabilly musicians in their early 20s, brought their guitars and played rock’n’roll and old timey folk music. Bart arrived: He, Jeff and I took a cab into town to grab beer and libations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think tourists are supposed to see the interior of Grand Turk. The place has a dusty, abandoned feel — like somebody tried erecting suburbs on the island and gave up mid-way through. Most businesses in town seem closed, and there aren’t many people on the streets. We saw a fleet of painfully thin horses nibbling some crab grass near a deserted church. In town, we got our beer in a hurry and departed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local beer, Turk’s Head, is extremely good — a crisp amber beer with a warming, barley-ish taste. Maybe the islanders will market the stuff abroad and become obscenely rich. I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hokay. I haven’t gotten a chance to post any of these notes because the Joomla program that runs Randi.org is snail-slow on the ship, and for some reason it’s impossible to tell whether a web page is loading or just sitting there, remaining contentedly blank. Sit for five minutes looking at the monitor: Maybe your desired page will come up, maybe it won’t. At some point you’ll hit “Refresh” and wait another five minutes to see if anything happens. Meanwhile, the whole thing costs $0.75 per minute, and after a while you begin thinking you’ve fallen prey to some piratical IT guy’s cruel profit-making scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, well. TAA5 won’t be remembered for slow Joomla load times. It will be remembered for the really fantastic diversity of people gathered here. There’s an aura of community and fraternity surrounding and enfolding all assembled, and you can feel it the moment you slip into the Deck 5 cigar bar where the skeptics have lately set up camp: a warm wash of fellow-feeling, pulling you over to one of a half-dozen tables where you can sit with people you’re only just beginning to know and set off on a freewheeling intellectual expedition that could go anywhere at any time. It’s a good thing. It rallies the troops, ourselves included. I’m going there now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you on dry land…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

But is it really true? Short answer: &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though she’s from New Jersey, it seems to have started with England’s famed and justly popular Daily Fail in an article titled &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1257850/Super-sized-mother-determined-worlds-fattest-woman-years.html"&gt;The super-sized 43st mother who is determined to become the world’s fattest woman&lt;/a&gt;. Some choice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The 42-year-old from New Jersey, U.S, is set on reaching the 1,000lb mark (71st) in just two years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ms Simpson already holds the Guinness World Record as the world’s fattest mother, when she gave birth in 2007 weighing 38stone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To achieve her goal, Donna says she will need to eat up to 12,000 calories a day (the average woman should consume only 2,000.)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To fund the massive $750 weekly food shop, she runs a website where men pay her to watch her eat fast food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story was reprinted around the world, and got a link from The Stranger’s &lt;a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/03/15/they-dont-mention-if-her-kid-has-been-taken-from-her"&gt;Slog&lt;/a&gt;, where readers were quick to point out that things didn’t seem quite right. For instance, &lt;strong&gt;Guinness no longer awards world records for fatness&lt;/strong&gt;, and besides, heavier women have already given birth. Also, searches for Simpson’s feeder site turned up empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, America’s shitty tabloids struck back at The Daily Fail when the New York Post published this &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/nj_woman_attempting_to_become_world_pco3O4qPWiCg3yjEWaxx9N?offset=176#comments"&gt;typo-ridden counter&lt;/a&gt; in which Simpson clarified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This whole thousand-pound goal has gotten blown way out of proportion,” Simpson said of her pie-in-the-sky dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a fantasy of mine. It’s not reality, yet everyone takes this and runs with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simpson claims she only wants to be recognized as the heaviest woman to ever give birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Post also contacted a spokesperson from Guinness to learn that “Guinness is thinking about creating a biggest birth mom category and considering Simpson’s application to be named largest living woman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are a few of The Daily Fail’s mistakes corrected, but what about Simpson’s web site where men pay to watch her eat and wash herself? The Post didn’t get any clarification about that. The first person to find it wins, and by “wins” I mean loses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for the record, Dan Savage is wrong to suggest this woman should have her kids taken away. Smokers, daredevils, snake handlers, creationists, anorexics, cancer patients, fishermen, and bomb disposal experts are free to have kids and so are people who eat a lot. Life’s unfair, get over it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268754799016"><id gr:original-id="977 at http://layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20a38ea662e2c9ae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Sexual Abuse of Women in the Church</title><published>2010-03-16T14:25:03Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T14:25:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://layscience.net/node/977" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; There has been widespread media coverage of the abuse of children by Catholic priests and few people are now unaware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been almost no publicity about the abuse of women by male members of the clergy and, despite the evidence, the Church appears to have done nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some women do have fully consensual relationships with male clergy but they are a small minority. When their stories make the media, they are usually of the more lurid 'priest has mistress and secret children' variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some abuse of adult men but a 2008 survey in America found that 96% of the victims were female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abuse falls into two categories, congregants and nuns.&lt;/p&gt;

See all the interviews in this series &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/scio10_interviews/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can check out previous years' interviews as well: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/so09_interviews/" title=""&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked John McKay from &lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Archy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://mammothtales.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Mammoth Tales&lt;/a&gt; blogs to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Where are you coming from (both geographically and philosophically)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've spent most of my life in and around the Pacific Northwest. I spent the years when I formed my adult identity in Alaska and, even though I now live in Seattle, I think of myself as Alaskan. Just for the record, everyone I know, with one exception, voted against Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a little kid during the golden years of the space program: the race to the moon. I watched every launch, even the satellites, and could name all of the astronauts up through the end of the Apollo program. At the same time, my dad worked for, what was then called, the Atomic Energy Commission building research reactors. I always assumed I'd become a scientist. But the way I saw great research projects treated--the budget cuts to scientific space research and some of my dad's projects being canceled and forgotten--soured me on the whole business. I think if I'd had some exposure to academic science I might have felt different. When I went to college I went as a history major.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I never gave up on science. I continued to follow science in the news. I have read Scientific American for the last thirty years or so. I spent most of the decade between college and graduate school working in bookstores and used my discount to buy almost as many popular science titles as history  titles. When it came time to pick a specialty in grad school, history of science was one of the finalists (I eventually picked modern Balkans and colonial Africa). Blogging gives me the opportunity to go back to some of the fields I passed up and write about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="archy pic.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/archy%20pic.gif" width="255" height="144" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;I guess this brings me to my blogging identity. I have a tiny blog called &lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;archy&lt;/a&gt; that I've been writing for almost seven years. The blog is about whatever catches my fancy: science news, history, conspiracy theories, and too much politics. I just created a second, depoliticized blog, called &lt;a href="http://mammothtales.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Mammoth Tales&lt;/a&gt;, that will focus more on science and history. Right now, I'm cross posting the same articles on both blogs, but, in time, I expect Mammoth Tales to develop an identity of its own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biography above pretty much says it all. I've spent the last half century as an enthusiastic and curious spectator of science, but I have zero in the way of formal credentials. For the last few years, I've been turning my historical training to the study of the history of science. It's amazing how useful some serious work in critical reading has been for me in fields that have traditionally been unrelated to history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell us a little more about your career trajectory so far: interesting projects past and present?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I've never had a job in science, there shouldn't be that much to tell. However, I do have experience in technology. After I left grad school, I was in a rather difficult career spot. My job history was a fragmented mess; for most of my working life I had held service jobs with no discernible pattern. My longest period of work had been in bookstores. At forty I wanted to start living something like a grown-up, but a bookstore salary wouldn't even allow me to pay my student loans. The world was not exactly overflowing with job offers for Master's degrees in Balkan History. Clever Wife helped me review my skills. We discovered I am good at explaining things and Seattle needed technical writers. I've spent the last dozen years writing help files and end user documentation for software and internet businesses. It's not exactly hard science, but it keeps me in contact with science minded people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is taking up the most of your time and passion these days? What are your goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mammoth small pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/mammoth%20small%20pic.jpg" width="150" height="99" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;Anyone who knows me or has read my blog during the last two or three years knows I'm working on a book about the early discoveries of woolly mammoths and how Enlightenment scientists deciphered what they were. Mammoths and mastodons were the first two extinct species to be identified as such and reconstructed. Until then, unfamiliar fossils were assumed to be remains of species that were still alive somewhere else. Many believed that it was impossible for a species to be completely extinct. Theologically, it implied imperfection in the perfect God's creation. But large land mammals, such as mammoths and mastodons, were simply too big to be hiding somewhere; they had to be extinct. This identification of the mammoth as an extinct species was a profound milestone in the history of science. In banishing a solely religious argument, it was an important step in establishing secular explanations as an integral part of the scientific method. Establishing the reality of extinction put in place one of the pillars of evolutionary theory. Finally, as a demonstration of the methodologies for reconstructing an unknown species from fossils, the mammoth set the science of paleontology on a firm footing. Of course the main reason for tackling this story is that it's a ripping good yarn. At various points, it touches on exploration, trade, the ebb and flow of empire, great thinkers, powerful monarchs, giants, dragons, unicorns, and the invention of chocolate milk. Besides, it's time for a mammoth book that looks at something other than the tired questions of why they went extinct and when we'll clone some new ones (the answers are bad luck and not yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="John McKay pic.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/John%20McKay%20pic.JPG" width="172" height="235" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;In my presentation at ScienceOnline2010, I talked about the professionalization of science and science publishing. In the eighteenth century, most of the--admittedly small--educated population of Europe and America could participate in the scientific endeavour. The scientific societies gave over a large part of their journal pages to correspondence from interested readers. Experiments and observations by gentleman farmers, frontier soldiers, and sea captains were important sources of new knowledge. That changed in the next century. In the nineteenth century, science became a professional business practiced by appropriately credentialed men in academia, government, and industry. Enthusiastic amateurs disappeared from the journals. A separate popular science press grew up to explain what the professionals were up to. Science was divided into practicers and spectators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see an new type of science communication emerging on the internet. We're never going to get back to the point where everyone can do original science, but amateurs be still be invaluable as observers. The internet makes it possible to organize those amateur observers into regional, and even global, networks. I'm thinking of astronomy and geology, where you can never have too many observers. I'm sure other fields will think of ways to use this enormous pool of free labor. Where this becomes relevant to people like me is that the internet makes it possible for the science literate to once again to participate in the discussion, rather than just to be passive spectators of science. Being allowed into the discussion is a very exciting development for people like me, who work outside science and/or have non-science backgrounds, but who are still interested in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second development that has been very exciting for me, as a writer and as an historian, has been access to information over the internet. It's almost a cliche for internet watchers to bemoan the amount of misinformation and bad information on the internet. What sometimes gets lost in these discussions is the fact that this is only a problem because the bad information is indiscriminately mixed in with good information. The problem is in knowing how to sort the two. It's really not that different than life outside the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mammoth book would not be possible without the internet. Most of the original sources that I have used in my research would not have been available to me just ten years ago. Many early journals existed for only a few years, in very small numbers. To read them, I would have had to travel to major libraries in Europe and the Eastern states, which would have been prohibitively expensive. Once at those libraries, I would have needed to get access to their rare book collections, which would have been very difficult since I lack an institutional affiliation. Because of Project Gutenberg, Google Books, and the efforts of libraries like the Bibliotheque nationale de France, Library of Congress, and Universität Göttingen, I can now read these works online. In may cases I can view scans of the actual pages and see how this information was first presented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to stick with the theme of being part of the discussion. I started blogging seven years ago primarily to rant and scream about politics. Since then, I have discovered many other uses for blogging. I can rant and scream about popular culture. I can rant and scream about religion. I can rant and scream about bad history. I can write thoughtful and informative essays--which everyone should read and link to--about mammoths. And I can try out ideas for the book. It's not my plan to serialize the book in my blogs. However, condensing parts of my research into short articles lets me see whether different narrative structures and organizations work. It's basically market testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social networks are a little trickier. Over the last few months, I've set up accounts on Facebook and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/archymck" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. I have reconnected with a few old friends over Facebook. I let them pull me into one of the games, which, for a while, was an enormous time suck. I haven't quite figured out what to do with Twitter. I can see how social networks can be useful for building a personal community, a brand, I'm just slow at learning how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you find all this online activity to be a net positive (or even a necessity) in what you do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a mixed blessing. The internet provides endless distractions and excuses for not working. At the same time it provides access to information, community, and a means to participate in meaningful discussions. With a modicum of self-discipline (and a modicum is all I have), I think it is a net positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you first discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any cool at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a snowballing thing for me. Because I have always been interested in science, I naturally hunted for a few science blogs when I started reading blogs. When Seed magazine set up Science Blogs, most of the blogs I was already reading were in the first group. As new blogs were incorporated, I started reading them. As I followed links out from the SciBlings and the commenters, I discovered more blogs. ScienceOnline2010 exposed me to still more. Getting back to the subject of internet distractions, I could easily spend a day or two each week just checking in on all of the blogs I've discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I went to the conference, I scoped out the sites of all the attendees. When I got home, I checked them again to attach faces to the blogs. I finished looking at &lt;a href="http://www.joannelovesscience.com/" title=""&gt;Joanne Loves Science&lt;/a&gt; and got up to get some coffee. Clever Wife was at her computer researching something for her home-crafted soap business. When I came in to ask if she needed a refill, I found her reading &lt;a href="http://www.joannelovesscience.com/" title=""&gt;Joanne Loves Science&lt;/a&gt;. One of her friends had recommended Joanne's &lt;a href="http://www.joannelovesscience.com/science_beauty.html" title=""&gt;Science of Beauty&lt;/a&gt; essays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the best aspect of ScienceOnline2010 for you?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate to repeat what everyone else has said, but it was meeting people. You are a  great example. You and I have not only been reading each others' blogs for years, but we've corresponded through e-mail, and regard each other as friends. Yet we had never met. Online identities usually only represent a part of a person's personality. Some people have a very carefully crafted and controlled online personality. It was great fun to see how the real people compared to their online personae and to how I imagined them. Most people were shorter than I expected. You were an exception. Joanne Manaster is also tall. I am not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the socializing, my main goal in coming to the conference was to get tips on turning my mammoth manuscript into a real book. I think my time at the conference was very productive. The sessions relating to writing all gave me useful ideas that I'm putting to work. I made several useful contacts. I was disappointed that no major publishing house editors stood up at dinner shouting "I have a bucket full of money for a good mammoth book." But you can't have everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Any suggestions for next year?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind the hotel to stock more beer before the weekend. All the local microbrews were tapped out before last call on Friday. That's just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to finally, finally meet you in person and thank you for the interview.

For greater anonymity, I have changed her name.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m an 18 year old girl from Sweden and I’m in my last year in high school. I’m not really an atheist myself, but I have read Friendly Atheist for quite a while now and know that you give good advice. I’ve always found ways to solve my problems myself, but this is such a difficult problem at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, two years ago I met the most wonderful guy and we’ve been together ever since. He is the sweetest person and a really great guy who has been with me despite a lot of hardships, and if it isn’t already obvious I love him very much. The problem is that he is a Muslim and I come from a deeply fundamentalist Christian home. (Yes, we actually do have a few fundamentalists up here.)  I’m not a fundamentalist myself, but my parents are, and they aren’t too happy about my choice of boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have grilled and browbeaten her, using emotional blackmail and have turned her younger sister and the whole family against her. They act distraught and say she’s “ruining their lives.” They have never met the young man, but they use the Bible to qualify their hatred for him. They have even mentioned committing suicide. The mother becomes hysterical and sometimes disappears from the house, forcing the father to go out searching for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her grandmother has met him and thinks he’s a really great guy, saying she understands why Dahlia loves him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahlia has tried to hold her own with her parents, presenting logical  arguments to reassure them, but they are relentless in their irrational loathing and disapproval. She is still financially dependent on them and doesn’t really want to lose her family.  Without the moral support of two friends, she thinks she would have broken up with her boyfriend just to have peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m under no delusion that my relationship with him will last forever anyway, but this isn’t really about him for me, it’s really about my own personal freedom, my right to write my own future free of my parents’ expectations and prejudices.  Not that they could technically stop me, but I don’t want to hurt them.  I don’t even want to think what would happen if on top of all this, they realized how I’m finding it harder and harder to believe in God, especially a personal one, but that’s a problem for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is how can I gain my freedom to follow my own path through the strange and varied forest that is life instead of the path of mundane predictability neatly laid out before me by my parents, without losing them, when rational arguments cut no ground and the Bible, which really isn’t on my side, reigns supreme?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to extend my most gracious thank you in advance for helping people whom you don’t even know and likely never will know with problems which are none of your concern. So thank you for that, it is most altruistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahlia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dahlia,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your parents are acting like little children.  They appear to be far younger emotionally than you are.  When grownups act like children, others can easily slip into acting like parents in response.  It is important for you to respond to them as an adult but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as a parent.  That would be stepping into a trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these histrionics and other manipulations by your parents fall under the category of emotional blackmail, just as you have correctly labeled it.  The basic idea is to try to get you to take responsibility for their hurt feelings and upset, and then use your guilt to make you comply with their wishes.  In their more extreme attempts, they escalate to trying to get you to take responsibility for their actual safety, as if they are helpless children and you are the parent.  This is the dynamic underlying the oh, so melodramatic tactics such as their remarks about suicide and your mother’s disappearing out of the house, essentially running away like a spoiled little girl.  She vanishes  thinking that you and your father will be alarmed, he will say something like “She’s in danger and it’s all your fault,” and you will cave in just to protect them from themselves.  In a twisted way, that ends up putting you in the role of the dedicated parent and them in the role of your vulnerable children.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this kind of manipulation can be stopped by confronting the perpetrators directly and overtly with the childish and selfish nature of their behavior, essentially shaming or embarrassing them into stopping.  However, I don’t get the impression that that would work in this case. Your parent’s tactics are shameless.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So another way to deal with emotional blackmail is to ignore it.  Like the flu, you suffer at first, but then you become immune to it.  It only works on the victim if she keeps taking that first step and agreeing that she is more responsible for what goes on inside someone else’s brain than they are.  This is not about becoming cold and uncaring. It’s about staying inside your head and taking care of your feelings.  You can care about someone else’s feelings, but you cannot &lt;em&gt;take care of&lt;/em&gt; their feelings. That’s &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your parents try to provoke you or guilt trip you, maintain your equanimity.  Show no frustration or upset.  Respond as if they just said something that has nothing to do with you, and is of no interest to you.  Say something like, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Uh huh. Okay I’m going out now and I’ll be back in the afternoon. I Love you, Mom and Dad. Bye.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have no hint of disdain or contempt in your voice.  You must sound emotionally neutral, as if you were discussing what to pick up at the market.  This is what I mean by playing the role of adult instead of the parent or the child.  Always include the “I love you, Mom and Dad,” because that is still an important part of the truth you’re saying. You’re just also showing that you’re not going to play their game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely disregard their invitations to argue with them.  You’ve already tried your best rational arguments, and they didn’t work. If they say something that is none of their business, you act as if they didn’t say it at all.  Ignore anything childish or parental or antagonistic that they say.  You only respond to respectful adult speech from them, and you always speak to them as a respectful adult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free yourself of the fear of “losing them.”  That vague, scary idea could run you around like a frantic slave.  Whatever “losing” actually means in real terms is probably not that likely when you really look at it.  Keep in mind that underneath their obsession with controlling you they probably have an awful fear of losing &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things are less emotionally charged, you might be able to reassure them, in adult-to-adult terms, that you aren’t rejecting them, you’re asserting yourself. If there is to be real peace in your family again, it is not going to be because they accept a boyfriend. It will be because they accept &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; as an independent adult.  Be patient.  That may take some time, and it is usually gradual.  The last growing up that parents do is to relate to their children as adults.  Even if they never do, you must relate as an adult to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think you are wise to acknowledge that your relationship with your boyfriend is not likely going to last forever, and that this is really a larger issue about your independence in general.  You’re also wise to not discuss the matter of your fading belief in God until that process runs whatever course it will, and it becomes much clearer in your own mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahlia, You want your freedom to follow your own path.  That is for adults, so play the part.  You said that they can’t actually stop you anyway.  You’re not yet financially independent, but you can be emotionally independent.  Regardless of whatever dramas others choose to play out, walk your path with the composure, poise and dignity of a woman who is her own person.  I think you have all that it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re Not Alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some vandals couldn’t deal with that message so they decided to &lt;a href="http://detroit.unitedcor.org/node/42"&gt;change it themselves&lt;/a&gt;, presumbly to suit their own point of view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://unitedcor.org/images/busad_detroitcor_van1_hires.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://unitedcor.org/images/busad_detroitcor_van1_hires.jpg" title="VandalizedDetroitAd1" width="550" height="623"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“Acts like this give a striking reminder that our message is necessary,” said Ruthe Milan, coordinator of Detroit CoR. “Without a doubt, prejudice against atheists and agnostics is still very real in American life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because this has happened, we stand even more resolved in our goal of being outspoken about our ideas,” Milan added. “And we expect that this vandalism will convince even more nontheistic Detroiters that getting organized is important for the cause of religious liberty.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Detroit SMART bus company replaced the ads free of charge, which was the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone wonder if these petty criminals realize that their idiotic actions just give the ads more publicity…?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, me neither.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He posted some great picture on Picasa, which you can see in the slideshow below or &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/108621824935534954086/Crosshairs#"&gt;on Picasa directly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/bin/slideshow.swf&amp;amp;width=610&amp;amp;height=406&amp;amp;flashVars=host%3Dpicasaweb.google.com%26hl%3Den_US%26feat%3Dflashalbum%26RGB%3D0x000000%26feed%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fpicasaweb.google.com%252Fdata%252Ffeed%252Fapi%252Fuser%252F108621824935534954086%252Falbumid%252F5440459916746830625%253Falt%253Drss%2526kind%253Dphoto%2526hl%253Den_US" width="610" height="406"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am totally blown away by the sculpture &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/108621824935534954086/Crosshairs#5440837844315935986"&gt;Solar Flares and CMEs&lt;/a&gt;. In the book, I describe how the tangling of the Sun’s magnetic field lines is like a bag full of springs under tension. How I pictured that in my head is almost exactly duplicated by that piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not get to NYC for the exhibit, but I really wish I had. The artwork is amazing, almost as amazing as the feeling I get thinking that a book I wrote for my own nefarious purposes actually inspired a group of artists to create such wonderful and astonishing pieces. My thanks to all of them for swelling my head just a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet the average reader of these articles is  apparently uninformed enough to not care.  Why else would so many  articles get published which feature "editorial support provided by  [insert name of ghostwriter here]." One my my favorite journals, under  the "so bad, it's good" category, is the Primary Care Companion to the  Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.  Good articles certainly make their way  into the journal, perhaps by accident, but the journal can always be  counted on to provide a steady supply of utter garbage.Here's  the acknowledgements section from one recent piece in the journal: "Editorial  support was provided by George Rogan, MSc, Phase Five Communications  Inc, New York, New York. Mr. Rogan reports no other financial  affiliations relevant to the subject of this article."  And in case  you're wondering, "Funding for editorial support was provided by  Bristol-Myers Squibb." If you've somehow guessed that this is an  advertorial for Abilify, you win. Other ghostwritten pieces of fluff  paid for by BMS include an article discussing the safety  profile of Abilify in depression.  It states that "In conclusion, this  post hoc analysis extends previous findings demonstrating that  aripiprazole is safe and generally well tolerated as an augmentation  strategy to standard ADT in patients with MDD with a history of an  inadequate response to antidepressant medication."  But Abilify caused  akathisia in a quarter of patients - I think that's a problem.But  wait... there's more.  An article based on data from two  trials, which showed (allegedly) that Seroquel improves anxiety in  patients with bipolar disorder.  This piece also acknowledges that it  was ghostwritten.  And we know that AstraZeneca, manufacturer of  Seroquel, has cooked the books on Seroquel in  the past.  Feel free to look through the journal every month and have a  giggle at some of the ridiculous pieces that make their way into print.  CMEYou can get your continuing medical education  (CME) from the Primary Care Companion as well.  One particularly  awesome piece of medical wisdom pimped  Abilify educated physicians about the best ways to manage  resistant depression.  This one is a beauty.  It was supported by cash  from BMS, which features prominently in the "treat aggressively" message  of the piece.  The article features none other than Michael Thase as  the leading discussant.  The same guy who was the leading author on a  paper which allegedly showed the wonders of Abilify for depression -  despite the pesky fact that patients said it didn't work. Back to  the CME.. Thase starts off by stating that only a third of patients  achieve remission of depressive symptoms during treatment.  Given that  Abilify is being marketed for treatment-resistant depression, this is a  perfect way to start off this infomercial educational  piece.  He adds that failure to achieve remission increases the risk of  suicide and puts people at risk for more depression, worse psychiatric  outcomes, and all sorts of other bad things.  So we better get rid of all  symptoms of depression. Thase suggests that clinicians should  closely monitor patients to see if their symptoms are remitting. In  particular, "Relying on the global statement “I’m definitely better”  from the patient overlooks persistent, minor, or residual symptoms. Dr  Thase recommended using a standardized symptom assessment measure and  keeping track of the patient’s levels of symptom burden." So even if the  patient says he or she is much better, don't believe it.  Have the  patient fill out rating scales and if any symptoms at any level  are present, keep treating.  In Thase's words, "If the current treatment  is well tolerated and the individual has made significant symptom  improvement but is still experiencing residual symptoms, then it may be  necessary to adjust the treatment dose, add another medication, or  combine pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy."  Note that adding  psychotherapy comes after adding another medication.Then  a series of other objective, expert psychiatrists chime in.  Dr. Gaynes  offers his wisdom, which includes "Dr Gaynes concluded that incomplete  remission requires aggressive  identification and management."  Don't be afraid - be aggressive.  The  unspoken message: Hey, using an antipsychotic like Abilify for  depression may seem freakin' crazy.  But don't worry, you need to be aggressive.   Dr. Trivedi then comments about using rating scales to measure side  effects.  I don't have much to say about his section, but things get  worse momentarily...Dr. Papakostas then checks in.  "A  meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies  found that augmentation of various antidepressants with the atypical  antipsychotic agents olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine was more  efficacious than adjunctive placebo therapy. In addition, Dr Papakostas  noted that the atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole was recently approved  by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as an adjunctive  therapy to antidepressants in MDD. Augmenting with  atypical antipsychotics has so far been the best studied strategy for  managing treatment-resistant depression, said Dr Papakostas."   Dr. P was the coauthor of a meta-analysis that provided "considerable  evidence" regarding the wonders of antipsychotic therapy for  depression.  The only problem was that the analysis actually did not  find convincing evidence that the drugs were particularly effective,  which I discussed in December 2009.Next comes  Dr. Shelton.  Time to be aggressive, again: "Thus, said Dr Shelton, the  long-term management of depression should be viewed in the context of  acute treatment and the need for early aggressive  management to get the patient as well as possible."  Be  aggressive by adding Abilify to the antidepressant regimen.  If not,  your patient won't achieve full remission and will suffer needlessly...  "Dr Shelton advised clinicians to be aggressive  in treatment and stay active over time, asking themselves if everything  hashonestly been done to help the patient."  Psychotherapy is given  a brief mention in this section, but let's face it -- most physicians  think of "be aggressive" as upping the dosage and/or adding medications -  not as "let's be aggressive by adding psychotherapy."Then  there's the exam at the end.  Write up your answers, mail them in, and  get your medical education credit.  Here's one of the questions...3.  Scores on both patient- and clinician-rated scales found that Ms B is  still experiencing residual depressive symptoms. You optimize her  current SSRI dose, which produces some improvement. She has not reported  any problems with side effects. What course of action to improve her  outcome has the most comprehensive efficacy data?a. Increase the  dose of her current SSRI againb. Augment her current SSRI with  another SSRIc. Switch her to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake  inhibitord. Augment her current SSRI with an atypical antipsychoticIf  you guessed that D is the correct answer, you're one step closer to CME  credit.  And one step closer to writing a prescription for Abilify  despite the fact that it is as likely to induce akathisia as to induce  remission of depressive symptoms.  Or that its advantage over placebo is  small on several measures and nonexistent on a patient-rated  measure of depression.  But D is still the "correct" answer.The offending  educational piece is cited below:...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

The infants were exposed to various musical and rhythmic stimuli, including isochronous drumbeats. Control stimuli consisted of adult- and infant-directed speech. The researchers could show that infants engage significantly more in rhythmic movement to music, and other rhythmically regular sounds, than to speech. The findings are suggestive of a predisposition for rhythmic movement in response to music and other metrically regular sounds. The study adds to the existing evidence that infants have a liking and preference for rhythmical music from day one, a predisposition that preceeds language.Zentner, M., &amp;amp; Eerola, T. (2010).

Many details of structure, amino acid identity and orientation can control this screw sense, and sometimes the controlling factors can be quite subtle. In a JACS communication, Jonathan Clayden (yes, the co-author of the amazing organic chemistry textbook) and his group uncover a surprising factor that controls the helical screw sense and also incorporate a neat &amp;quot;reporter group&amp;quot; to monitor the screw sense.But this reporter group is nothing fancy and is simply a gycine installed in the middle of a long sequence of amino acids which consists of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid or Aib. Aib is simply alanine with an extra methyl at the alpha carbon. It is well known to impart helical propensities to peptides and has been used several times as a helical &amp;#39;lock&amp;#39;.In this case the Gly is in the center of a 20 amino acid peptide where all other residues are Aib. The peptide is clearly helical, but what&amp;#39;s the screw sense? That&amp;#39;s where the power of NMR spectroscopy comes in. The two protons in Gly are diastereotopic which means that in principle they could have different chemical shifts and signals in the NMR spectrum. In practice though, rapid interconversion between the left and right handed helices leads to an average and gives a single signal in the spectrum.However if interconversion between the two screw senses could be &amp;#39;biased&amp;#39; by making the equilibrium constant favor one of them, then one could presumably observe two separate signals for the two Gly protons even if the transition is fast on the NMR time scale. To accomplish this, Clayden et al. do something peculiar; they incorporate a L-Phe residue at the N-terminal of the helix. This group, even if far away from the central Gly, somehow seems to remotely interact differently with each of the two Gly protons. The incorporation of this terminal group leads to a considerable splitting in the signals of the two protons (up to 100 ppm), easily distinguishing them apart. Also for some reason, N-terminal groups seem to work better than C-terminal groups.The reasons for the transmission of this effect over no less than 27 bonds are not clear, but they probably have something to do with the subtle change in conformational behavior that dictate helix folding. The authors even observe small differences for amide vs ester bonds as capping groups. Finally, they obtain an x-ray structure of this helix which turns out to be a 3/10 helix and confirm their observations.These days there is a drive to &amp;#39;tether&amp;#39; certain parts of oligopeptides to lock the resulting conformation in a helical form. Sometimes, even constraining end groups covalently (by metathesis for instance) seems to ensure a critical &amp;#39;nucleation&amp;#39; structure that then zips up the rest of the helix. The exact percentage of the helix in solution could be a matter for discussion, but this study seems to indicate similiar end-group influenced conformational organization. I thought it was neat and points to further challenges and questions in our understanding of the deceptively simple question, &amp;quot;Why are helices stable in solution&amp;quot;?Solà, J., Helliwell, M., &amp;amp; Clayden, J.

It was found that patients with posterior lesions experienced a considerable increase in &amp;#39;spirituality&amp;#39; after the surgical removal of their tumours than those with anterior lesions, and that those with more aggressive types of tumour were most likely to describe themselves as religious. For a fuller report and discussion of this fascinating study, please see Mo Costandi&amp;#39;s Neurophilosophy....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Aliens, of course, was the best sequel ever –  that rare event when the sequel is actually better than the original  movie (of course, the series went down hill from there, like Star Trek  it peaked with the second movie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year we heard the results of the Autism Omnibus – a special  court with three special masters set up to resolve about 5,000 cases  before the vaccine court claiming that autism resulted from vaccines –  either the MMR vaccine or thimerosal (a mercury-based preservative in  some vaccines, but removed from most by 2002). In the US there is a &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/"&gt;Vaccine Injury  Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; (VICP) which bypasses the regular courts and  awards compensation to those injured by vaccines, paid for by a small  tax on each dose of vaccine given. The purpose is to rapidly compensate  those who might have been injured (the threshold for evidence is quite  low) and to encourage pharmaceutical companies to manufacture vaccines  (the threat of suit would make it not viable otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 2008 the Autism Omnibus heard three cases that were presented as  the test cases (presumably the best cases they could come up with) for  the theory that the  MMR vaccine (with or without thimerosal from other  vaccines – MMR never had thimerosal) caused or contributed to autism in  some individuals. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=478"&gt;They ruled  against all three cases&lt;/a&gt;, stating in very strong terms that there is  no evidence to back up the claims of a link between MMR and autism.  Judge Hasting wrote of one case – Cedillo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering all of the evidence, I found that the  petitioners have  failed to demonstrate that thimerosal-containing  vaccines can contribute  to causing immune dysfunction, or that the MMR  vaccine can contribute  to causing either autism or gastrointestinal  dysfunction. I further  conclude that while Michelle Cedillo has  tragically suffered from autism  and other severe conditions, the  petitioners have also failed to  demonstrate that her vaccinations  played any role at all in causing  those problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="More..." src="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""&gt;This was a huge blow to the anti-vaccine crowd, and an excellent  victory for science and reason. It was the equivalent of the Kitzmiller  vs Dover trial for Intelligent Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it reinforced my respect for the judicial process in hearing  scientific cases. Stephen J. Gould once observed (I think in reference  to Creation Science trials of the 1980s – and I am paraphrasing) that  when there are rules of evidence, science generally triumphs over  pseudoscience. Pseudosciences, like anti-vaccine nonsense, intelligent  design/creationism, and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=1663"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt; – do not fare well when their shenanigans are inspected under the  patient and penetrating glare of a thorough trial. Pseudosciences depend  upon cherry picking evidence, using logical fallacies, distraction and  diversion – all tricks which are exposed by a court following rules of  evidence and logic, and taking the time to review all the evidence. We  now have a series of high-profile cases in which Gould’s observation is  confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we always worry that such cases will be decided on matters  of law rather than matters of evidence, and then be misinterpreted as  confirmation of the pseudoscience. This happened in the 1980s when  chiropractors were successful in a restraint of trade suit against the  AMA, and then later claimed this was a vindication of chiropractic (it  wasn’t). But that’s another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, generally science does well in controlled settings, and  this past week we saw another example. The Autism Omnibus Court rendered  their second set of decisions regarding the next three test cases –  this time focusing on the hypothesis that thimerosal causes autism. In  all three cases they ruled solidly against the petitioners, stating that  they did not make their case. The ruling was not just negative – like  the Dover decision, it was a harsh condemnation of the case put forward  by the lawyers for the petitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the full decisions here: &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Campbell-Smith%20Mead%20Autism%20Decision.pdf"&gt;George  and Victoria Mead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Hastings.King%20Decision.pdf"&gt;Fred  and  Mylinda King&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/Vowell.Dwyer.FINAL.pdf"&gt;Timothy  and Maria Dwyer&lt;/a&gt;. While expressing sympathy for the parents and  their children, the masters ruled against every aspect of the case they  brought forward. For background, autism is an “off table” injury claim –  there is no presumption of causation, but petitioners must demonstrate  their case with a “preponderance of evidence.” This is a lower standard  than would be used in science, and the decision is limited to whether or  not compensation is appropriate – not the ultimate scientific  conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights from the decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for petitioners’ claim does not come from the  epidemiologic evidence, and petitioners’ claim that the performed  studies lack the requisite specificity to detect an association between  the receipt of thimerosal-containing vaccines and the allegedly small  subset of cases involving autism with clear signs of regression is  unavailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioners have not shown either that certain  children are genetically hypersusceptible to mercury or that certain  children are predisposed to have difficulty excreting mercury. The  scientific validity of the studies on which petitioners rely has been&lt;br&gt;
questioned and the conclusions drawn from the studies have been  criticized as unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While petitioners have alleged  correctly that inorganic mercury can remain in the brain for a period of  time, petitioners have not shown that the inorganic mercury deposited  in the brain–in the amount that could be received from a full complement  of thimerosal containing vaccines–can cause the effects that  petitioners have alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you will excuse a somewhat longer excerpt, this section on the  claim that response to treatment with chelation proves mercury caused  autism, is a good example of the kind of analysis used in the hearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondent’s experts Dr. Rust and Dr. Fombonne argued  persuasively that it would be inappropriate to draw any inferences  concerning causation, in Jordan’s case or any case, from Dr. Mumper’s  testimony concerning treatments, for several reasons. First, they  pointed out that the treatments to which Dr. Mumper referred have not  been demonstrated by scientific testing to have any beneficial effects  on autism in general. Dr. Brent provided similar testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second,  respondent’s experts explained that autistic children quite often have  periods of substantial improvement in their symptoms in the absence of  any treatment, so that it is not reasonable to conclude that a  particular period of improvement was caused by any recent treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third,  respondent’s experts noted that because Jordan was often subjected to  more than one treatment at a time, it is even more dubious to ascribe  any improvements to particular treatments. (Ex. M, paras. 46, 142-43;  Tr. 2459-60, 3697-99.)&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, it is clear that chelation treatments do not remove mercury  from the brain, so it is not logical to conclude that such treatment  could affect autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this regard, on cross-examination Dr.  Mumper herself acknowledged that she could not 108 explain how the other  treatments upon which she relied could, even in theory, affect the  persistent inorganic mercury in the brain that she believes to be a  contributing cause of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In concluding that  petitioners have failed to establish that Colin’s TCVs caused his ASD, I  emphasize that I have not applied a heightened evidentiary burden. I  did not require scientific certainty, nor direct evidence of causation.  Daubert requires that an opinion be supported by something more than  subjective belief; it must be grounded in “the methods and procedures of  science.” 509 U.S. at 590. There is no evidence that mercury has ever  caused an ASD, only speculation that it might. At best, there is some  evidence of an ongoing inflammatory process in ASD, but no indication  that it is caused by mercury, and many indications that it is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  last paragraph has two points I want to highlight. The first is the  citation of the standard of evidence used – as I said, less than  scientific proof, but it must be based on something. The second is that  Special Master Vowell acknowledges that there is no evidence “mercury  has ever caused an ASD (autism spectrum disorder).” This is in contrast  to the claim by some anti-vaccinationists that the VICP has admitted  vaccines cause autism in some cases. They have not. They have only  decided in certain cases that “compensation is appropriate” and in the  cases often put forward, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=341"&gt;such as the Hannah  Poling case&lt;/a&gt;, the child did not have autism but some other  neurological disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This most recent  decision by the Autism Omnibus is a slam dunk – after an exhaustive  review of the evidence, allowing both sides to present their best case,  the three masters are unanimous in their strong opinion that there is no  evidence linking thimerosal to autism. They trashed every claim and  argument brought forward by the petitioners – the logic and evidence  simply does not support their case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the  anti-vaccinationists cannot accept the unavoidable conclusion – the  current evidence simply does not support their claim. So they  predictably retreat to conspiracy-mongering. Read the comments to any  anti-vaccine blog on this topic – there is the casual assumption that  the masters (along with the CDC, AMA, FDA, AAP, and every  science-blogger) are in the pockets of evil “big pharma”. They have  their narrative, and they will not be distracted by anything so pesky as  facts and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a huge win, there is another  case on the horizon that is the cause of some concern – Bruesewitz v.  Wyeth. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear this case, which will test  whether or not a family can sue a pharmaceutical company for an alleged  vaccine injury and bypass the VICP. This case will be decided by the law  – not science – and so I have no idea which way it will go. If the  Supreme Court rules that people can bypass VICP this will undercut one  of its primary functions, and the flood gates will open.  Anti-vaccinationists could make it untenable for pharmaceutical  companies to market vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I applaud this follow up to  the Autism Omnibus hearing, I hope it does not follow the pattern of  Aliens and Star Trek and peak with the first sequel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sunday, January 17 at 9-10:05am 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;E.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Science online talks between generations&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/blugger" title=""&gt;Beatrice Lugger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/PM_09_Nobel_Laureate_Meeting_2009__Follow_the_Proceedings_Online.AxCMS" title=""&gt;Christian Rapp&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description: In huge meetings around the world several organizations try to initiate a dialogue between top scientists and young researchers -the &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de"&gt;Lindau Meetings of Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; are one of them providing numerous opportunities for an exchange of ideas and thoughts between young researchers and Nobel Laureates. The idea is to support this dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. We'd like to discuss how one can initiate a continued communication process even between two meetings. Which internet/social web tools might be useful to bridge the communication habits of a younger generation with that of an older generation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is if one can organize such a dialogue with a special platform in the web, where current science topics can be discussed and the talks and thoughts can be followed by a broader public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get some impressions of the Lindau Nobel Laureates meeting itself please visit the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/WebHome.AxCMS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, click through the archives, read in the &lt;a href="http://www.lindau-nobel.de/MeetingReports.AxCMS"&gt;annual reports&lt;/a&gt; and take a look at the actual list of &lt;a href="http://lindau-nobel.de/PublicParticipants.AxCMS?Meeting=278&amp;amp;Usergroup=6742"&gt;Nobel Laureates&lt;/a&gt; who are expected to join the next meeting (the participation list of young researchers will be online by the end of April 2010).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim is to promote the scientific communication between generations. &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/video/lindau2009/index.html"&gt;Five short films&lt;/a&gt; presented by Nature Video, show some kinds of such a dialogue. Join Laureates and young researchers as they discuss the future of medicine, consider the ethics of nanotechnologies, plan new collaborations, and seek ways to avoid dangerous climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely there also exists a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.de/lindaunobel/2009/06/exemplifying-apprenticeship-the-lindau-meetings.php"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting and we are acitve on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/LindauNobelLaureatesMeeting"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/lindaunobel"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Till now the traffic on these plattforms abruptly drops down after the meetings and grows up some weeks before the next one. We'd like to find new ways to encourage a continuous dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Jenny’s point of view regarding science in general and vaccines in particular is that her own experiences trump those of orthodox science, and that her opinions, backed up with her diploma in logic from the University of Google, matter far more than the views of others with specific clinical and research experience and established authority in the field. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review mentions one intriguing observation: the presence of tons of insects in the air overhead.  My students often wonder, when I’m teaching biogeography, how long-distance migration of insects and spiders takes place, since remote oceanic islands often harbor a lot of endemic arthropods whose ancestors must have come from mainlands.  I talk a bit about this in &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt; (which I don&lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;t assign to my students), but here’s more detail from the review of Raffles’s book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, that square mile over Louisiana in “Air.” In 1926, P. A. Glick, a  scientist from the federal Division of Cotton Insect Investigations,   and colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, among others, counted  about 25 million to 36 million insects, including a ballooning spider  they found flying at 15,000 feet, “probably the highest elevation at  which any specimen has ever been taken.” (A Boeing transatlantic  passenger jet flies at an average of 35,000 to 40,000 feet.) We know how  the Boeing gets up there, but the spider’s launch is an aeronautical  feat unequaled by aerospace engineers. Here’s how Mr. Raffles describes  what Mr. Glick observed: the spiders “not only climb up to an exposed  site (a twig or a flower, for instance), stand on tiptoe, raise their  abdomen, test the atmosphere, throw out silk filaments, and launch  themselves into the blue, all free legs spread eagled, but they also use  their bodies and their silk to control their descent and the location  of their landing.”  His own sense of wonder is infectious: “Thirty-six  million little animals flying unseen above one square mile of  countryside? The heavens opened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a nice video of spider ballooning and &lt;a href="http://faculty.vassar.edu/suter/1websites/sutersite/index.html"&gt;the intrepid biophysicist&lt;/a&gt; who studies it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/new-science-book/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/kYPABcMzbEg/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Walt Whitman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;A noiseless patient spider&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;I mark’d where on a little promontory it stood isolated,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Mark’d how to explore the vacant vast surrounding,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;It launch’d forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First, for the original clip of Rush's extremism in all its glory, listen here:

I couldn't resist asking for Revkin's response to Limbaugh, which came at around minute 13:00 of the show. Revkin first set the stage for Rush's performance as follows:
I was speaking about three very tricky things: population growth, United States consumer habits, and climate--in one riff. I was participating via video hookup with a Wilson Center event, and basically I said, "Look, if you're going to go with the whole carbon-centric meme, and we'll have carbon credits for this, that, and the other, and you live in America, where we're heading from 300 million to 400 million people in the next 30 or 40 years, why shouldn't a family get carbon credits for having fewer kids?"
It was what I would call a thought experiment. And that got picked up by some right wing blog, and that got picked up by Rush Limbaugh, who I'm sure never saw the original video thing....Just hearing the audio ...</summary><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268744868869"><id gr:original-id="http://paandpsy.blogspot.com/2010/03/spotlight-on-inactivity.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7157c513e1fbcb14</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Spotlight on Inactivity</title><published>2010-03-16T07:14:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T07:14:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/dCnoMDl2oUA/spotlight-on-inactivity.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://paandpsy.blogspot.com/2010/03/spotlight-on-inactivity.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">A report published yesterday in the UK by Professor Sir Liam Donaldson the UK Government&amp;#39;s Chief Medical Officer, and the professional head of all medical staff in England, draws attention to the role of inactivity in the nations health. The report states that &amp;quot;the benefits of regular physical activity to health, longevity, well being and protection from serious illness have long been established. They easily surpass the effectiveness of any drugs or other medical treatment. The challenge for everyone, young and old alike, is to build these benefits into their daily lives&amp;quot;&amp;quot;.Key points• Inactivity affects 60–70% of the adult population: that is more people than obesity, alcohol misuse and smoking combined.• The physical fitness of children is declining by up to 9% per decade.• By increasing the risk of developing more than six major diseases, inactivity poses a significant risk to the population’s health.• Physical activity tends to decline with age, but this decline is not inevitable.• The potential benefits of physical activity to health are huge. If a medication existed which had a similar effect, it would be regarded as a ‘wonder drug’ or ‘miracle cure’.Nice to see this being spelled out so clearly in the media, its getting a lot of publicity in the UK.  The report can be found here and the physical activity section starts on page 20.Blair, S (2007). 61 Physical inactivity: the biggest public health problem of the 21st Century Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 10, 29-29 DOI: 10.1016/S1440-2440(07)70066-X...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Enjoy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve attended lectures by skeptics at a few conferences by now; one of the more popular presentations involves mentioning the funny side involved in the phenomenon of ‘backmasking’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly &lt;a title="weird al" href="http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Backward_message_-_Deliberate_backmasking/id/613825"&gt;Weird Al&lt;/a&gt; finds it funny too, when he ‘remembers Larry’, although he deliberately hides those messages. When our minds make meaning of genuinely garbled reversed songs – then it becomes of interest to science, skeptics and the credulous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally think the topic of backmasking could presented a little better by such speakers. It involves taking a different approach to the topic of ‘the way we mishear messages in songs and mistakenly assume weird things about them’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the easiest to find online (inspired by &lt;a title="rw" href="http://www.richardwiseman.com"&gt;Dr Richard Wiseman’s&lt;/a&gt; presentation at TAM3) is the ‘Stairway To Heaven’ reversal, demonstrated by &lt;a title="skeptic" href="http://www.skeptic.com"&gt;Dr Michael Shermer&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a title="Shermer TED" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/22"&gt;TED site&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a useful concept to discuss with students; the technique in which a sound or message is played backwards from a track that is meant to be played forwards. It reflects how our senses can be fooled, how we are all subject to cognitive biases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they’re intentional (&lt;a title="comedy" href="http://www.backmaskonline.com/comedy.php"&gt;great comedy selection here&lt;/a&gt; from backmaskonline.com) and sometimes they prompt bizarre accusations of the satanic sort (&lt;a title="rtorg" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_cul5.htm"&gt;Religious Tolerance.org&lt;/a&gt; gives some excellent examples of these myths, including some religious rants on the issue – &lt;em&gt;“if we are weak in our convictions our moral values can be changed subliminally by suggestion in rock music, TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, billboards, etc.”)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into what makes things ‘&lt;a title="subliminal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_messages"&gt;subliminal&lt;/a&gt;‘ is naturally ongoing; the notion of manipulating our senses by design is just too alluring to ignore, especially in advertising. I did notice this recent investigation on &lt;a title="Eureka Alert subliminal " href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-12/thuo-smc122707.php"&gt;national flags helping to moderate political attitudes&lt;/a&gt;, but backwards messages don’t influence behaviour when featured in rock music nor are they consciously or unconsciously understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there was a top ten of backmasked songs, then naturally “Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin would be the first – it’s been used in all three presentations I’ve seen. Yet I don’t like using it in my classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that using that particular example poses some problems with my students, who sometimes consider it to be &lt;em&gt;confirming&lt;/em&gt; the phenomenon of ‘hidden messages’ or ’satanic lyrics’ rather than paying attention to the garble that’s produced before the ‘alternative’ &lt;span&gt;backwards&lt;/span&gt; lyrics are shown. After all, that’s the argument made by people who claim that there are messages within ‘evil rock music’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I suggest using this example of a hymn being misheard and subtitled instead, which is available on YouTube and produced by the comedian Adam Buxton (&lt;a href="http://www.adambuxton.com/"&gt;www.adambuxton.com&lt;/a&gt;). I find it has been more successful in getting the message across about how we mentally fill in the blanks to create meaning. I wrote to him personally and said that I was hoping to use it in my classes and he was really enthusiastic and appreciative! Do check out the rest of his work online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-ZnPE3G_YY"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-ZnPE3G_YY"&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-ZnPE3G_YY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Original” lyrics of the song are as follows – I usually provide students with a copy beforehand and encourage them to look at them whilst listening to the song and then looking up at the subtitles to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blessed city, heavenly Salem,&lt;br&gt;
vision dear of peace and love,&lt;br&gt;
who of living stones art builded&lt;br&gt;
art the joy of heaven above,&lt;br&gt;
and, with angel hosts encircled,&lt;br&gt;
as a bride dost earthward move;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;from celestial realms descending,&lt;br&gt;
bridal glory round thee shed,&lt;br&gt;
meet for him whose love espoused thee,&lt;br&gt;
to thy Lord shalt thou be led;&lt;br&gt;
all thy streets and all thy bulwarks&lt;br&gt;
of pure gold are fashioned. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently I was sent the following subtitled song – the song is in Hindi but substitutes English words for what was is misheard. “&lt;em&gt;Minor Bun Benny Lava”&lt;/em&gt;! Of course, many people have probably done this with songs in error (I still think that “Our Lips are Sealed” is about forbidden love for an aquatic mammal – “&lt;a title="Excuse Me Whilst I Kiss This Guy!" href="http://www.kissthisguy.com/lyric.php?id=66125"&gt;Alex the Seal&lt;/a&gt;“).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sigh. I have a bottle of wine here I'll be drinking alone. Because of the time difference, she'll be sleeping while I'm awake and vice versa. We'll celebrate when I get back on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

Every book in that excellent library carries a stamp of ownership on that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I was reading Frans G. Bengtsson's 1947 essay collection &lt;i&gt;För nöjes skull&lt;/i&gt;. A bit into his piece about Fagertärn, the little lake near Stjernsund whence the red pond liles once came, I found the stamp of the Saltsjöbaden Municipal Library -- on page 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this secret tradition among librarians restricted to Sweden? To libraries of the 1940s and ones of today with long traditions? Dear Reader, please check any library books you have at hand, and if there's an ownership stamp on page 17, tell us the name and location of the library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 27 March:&lt;/b&gt; The page 17 thing must be pretty widespread. Only in the past three hours, at least three people have arrived here after googling "library stamp p. 17", "why libraries stamp on page 17" and "book stamp p. 17". Too bad they aren't commenting.&lt;/p&gt;

There is medicine that has been shown to work through science, medicine that has not yet been shown to work, and medicine that has been shown not to work. "Alternative" medicine that is shown to work through science ceases to be "alternative" and becomes simply medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when I think I might need to change that opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not exactly. However, promoters of various forms of alternative medicine, stymied when they try to show that their woo works through science, seem to think that they can just make up alternative science in order to "explain" their favored quackery. Some of the people who do this have rather--shall we say?--colorful imaginations, too. Remember, for example, Lionel Milgrom and his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_its_no.php"&gt;torturing of quantum physics&lt;/a&gt; to justify homeopathy? Or his imagining the "healer"-patient relationship as a "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_circle_is_co_1.php"&gt;quantized gyroscope&lt;/a&gt;"? Or Milgrom's representation of homeopathy as the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/your_friday_dose_of_woo_when_a_mad_mathe.php"&gt;semiotic notion that the homeopathic remedy is a 'sign' working simultaneously in and for two different but connected meaningful contexts&lt;/a&gt;"? Sadly, Milgrom is not alone in just making shit up. Dr. Charlene Werner, for instance, is not nearly as imaginative or talented at making woo up as Milgrom, as her &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/10/your_friday_dose_of_woo_on_wednesday_a_h.php"&gt;widely mocked video&lt;/a&gt; about homeopathy and "energy" shows. The same is true of John Benneth and his even sillier &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_physics_of_h.php"&gt;attribution of clathrate hydrates&lt;/a&gt; as the One True Mechanism by which homeopathy works. When science doesn't support woo-meisters, apparently they feel free to make science say whatever they need it to say to "explain" their quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I've found another doozy, this time from William A. Tiller. We've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/your_friday_dose_of_woo_woo_even_more_po.php"&gt;met William Tiller before&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, he actually had the audacity to propose a "higher-dimensional-level substance, labeled deltrons, falling outside the constraints of relativity theory and able to move at velocities" faster than the speed of light and that acts as "a coupling agent between the electric monopole types of substances and the magnetic monopole types of substances to produce both electromagnetic (EM) and magnetoelectric (ME) types of mediator fields exhibiting a special type of 'mirror principle' relationship between them," and I proposed that Tiller and Milgrom battle it out in a steel cage match to see whose woo is strongest. It's now three years later, and Tiller is back with more ammunition to use to prove whose woo reigns supreme, and all I can say is: Wow, maaaaan! Check out the title: &lt;a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2009.0125"&gt;On Understanding the Very Different Science Premises Meaningful to CAM Versus Orthodox Medicine: Part I--The Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell right away that Tiller is going to make stuff up by the very title! Notice how he makes a dichotomy of "very different science premises" needed to be "meaningful" to CAM. In the real world, science is science. Different disciplines of science don't need "very different science premises" to be "meaningful" to them. The scientific method is the scientific method. There may be different ways of applying the scientific method necessitated by different disciplines and different situations, but certain core principles always remain regardless of the specific scientific discipline, principles such as hypothesis testing and falsification. Not so, apparently, in woo world!

&lt;p&gt;This is despite an admission by the Technology/Clinical Practice Committee that &lt;strong&gt;‘There is no good evidence of effectiveness for naturopathic advice in patients with endometriosis.’ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.endometriosis.org.au/"&gt;Endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; is a painful condition characterised by bloating, period pain, heavy or irregular bleeding and occurs when the tissue that normally lines the uterus (the endometrium) is found outside the uterus. Endometriosis can be a chronic, recurring condition and occurs in approximately 10% of women. The causes are not fully understood, but treatments include surgery, hormone therapy as well as medication for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bizarre decision summary (full pdf &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009decisionsummary.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), released by the Committee, of the &lt;a href="http://www.southernhealth.org.au/page/Hospitals/Monash_Medical_Centre"&gt;Southern Health Moorrabbin Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, they state;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The applicants have stipulated that the naturopath will not initiate discussions about naturopathic medication, however it is anticipated that patients may bring this up. In this situation &lt;strong&gt;the naturopath will advise that there is no evidence for safety or effectiveness &lt;/strong&gt;(my emphasis). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems in stark contrast to the role of the committee &lt;a href="http://www.mihsr.monash.org/cce/shtcp.html"&gt;which is described as&lt;/a&gt; ‘to ensure that new technologies and clinical practices at Southern Health are introduced within a rigorous and evidence-based framework’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision summary also states that;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The naturopath will not be prescribing..’ but will ‘be providing dietary and exercise advice and general health measures.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s curious therefore that the hospital did not employ a dietitian, who could easily fulfill such a role without the humiliation of having to tell patients that there is ‘no evidence for the safety and efficacy’ of their own profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal was also put forward in 2008, but &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008decisionsummary.pdf"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt;. It is not clear why it was approved on this occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the decision summary, the committee states (perhaps in acknowledgement of the lack of evidence) that the ‘This clinic will provide opportunities for research into the role of naturopathy in endometriosis.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position will be trialled for two years, then reviewed with the  option of making it permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The primary goal of Project Reason is to spread scientific thinking and secular values.&lt;/strong&gt; We invite you to help us further our work by submitting a short video that conveys the message of the foundation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think that any is really worthy of a $10,000 prize… There are some terrific videos in the bunch, but do they really further the cause? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, my favorites (with short commentary) are below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/o0m_gu-llmU%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny video.  But it just mocks religion.  Nothing wrong with that, per se, but does it really “spread scientific thinking and secular values”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/j2NXQb4ZtVM%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the music and animation.  But the ending threw me off.  I know science is doing something “miraculous”… but, in a way, wasn’t the soothsayer right?  Wouldn’t that defeat the purpose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/GBLyvp0_00w%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I *love* this video.  Except for the ending.  That was an anti-climax.  It would’ve been nicer to see a chorus of people reading science books drowning out the Bible Thumper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you prefer any of &lt;a href="http://www.project-reason.org/contests/video_contest/#vote"&gt;the other videos&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;

Simple experimental design.  Take 165 undergraduate students and enroll them in a study you tell them is about memory and where as part of their reward for inclusion, they&amp;#39;ll be given a snack.  Ask half of them to memorize a 2 digit number and the other half a 7 digit number and once they&amp;#39;ve memorized their numbers ask them to go into a second room where they are faced with their snack choice - either a piece of chocolate cake or a cup of fruit salad.  Track choice and then follow up with an exploration of the students&amp;#39; perceived reasons for making the choice.The results?63% of the students who were trying to remember the 7 digit number chose the cake compared with only 42% of those trying to remember the 2 digit number.  Students who chose the cake reported a stronger emotional decision making drive while those who chose the fruit salad reporter a stronger cognitive drive.Researchers hypothesized that the difference was explicable on the basis of the 7 digit memory group having &amp;quot;lower levels of processing resources&amp;quot; with much of their cognitive brain power being spent on trying to remember their 7 digit number.Moral of the story?Don&amp;#39;t eat on a full brain.Shiv, B., &amp;amp; Fedorikhin, A.

&lt;p&gt;After all, some Muslims fall apart into frightened hysterics when someone draws a cartoon. It's happened again; &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8569444.stm"&gt;a couple of Muslim kooks have been arrested for threatening to murder a cartoonist&lt;/a&gt;. Lars Vilks' crime was drawing Mohammed as a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it could have been greed that motivated them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, a group linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq offered a $100,000 (£66,000) reward for killing Mr Vilks, and a 50% bonus if he was &amp;quot;slaughtered like a lamb&amp;quot; by having his throat cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Designed here in the &lt;em&gt;Junior Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; studio by webmaster William Bull, this format offers something that speaks right to my heart as an artist: the chance to run honking big 3-column graphic banners. It’s taken skepticism a while to get on board with this “pictures are good” business. Here was a chance to have some fun with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knocked around some ways to play with the format, but I always knew where I wanted to start. My own background is in visual art — portraiture in particular. To me, there are few things so compelling as a human face. And hey, “a human face” is just what skepticism needs more of.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been involved in skepticism for as long as three or four minutes, you know what it feels like to be cast as the villain. After all, are we not “closed-minded debunkers”? Well, OK, we’re not. I’m not sure I’ve ever even met a skeptic who was quite the nay-saying caricature our critics would have us believe — but it’s hard to say that in a way that people can hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about putting a more welcoming face to skepticism, I thought immediately of Robynn “Swoopy” McCarthy, co-host of the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skepticality&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the show is known as &lt;em&gt;Skepticality — the Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine,&lt;/em&gt; and that’s no accident. I fell in love with the show’s sincerity and heart early on; when I saw the opportunity for us to assist each other’s projects, I leapt for it. I’ve never regretted that strong alliance for a second. Derek and Swoopy’s dedication, humanity and passion have only grown in all the time since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I knew, Swoopy was my first choice for the banner portrait series. What better ambassador could skepticism hope for, especially in the “skepticism 2.o” era? Nor is it just her manner or intelligence or that wonderful smile that make her an ideal representative: as co-creator of the world’s &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; skeptical podcast, Swoopy is a genuine pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, it’s perfectly fair to say she helped create skepticism 2.0. Things have changed so fast that it’s easy to forget how sweeping the changes have been. When Swoopy first rolled up her sleeves for skepticism, the landscape was utterly different. As Skepticblog’s Brian Dunning (of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/"&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) recalled, “The first time I listened to &lt;em&gt;Skepticality&lt;/em&gt;, I learned two things. First, that there was such a thing as ‘podcasting.’ Second, that there was such a thing as ‘the skeptical movement.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the thing that stands out most of all: &lt;em&gt;Skepticality&lt;/em&gt; took the stage as a purely independent project. &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; has helped to extend their reach, but Derek and Swoopy changed the world all by themselves. “&lt;a href="http://ohioskeptic.com/grassrootsskeptics/"&gt;Grassroots skepticism&lt;/a&gt;” indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my own portrait of Swoopy as the seed, I invited a small group of skeptics to contribute photos and bios for the banner series (and set to work hammering the contributions into a standard format for the series). Some are well-known figures; others are members of the wider community. Each, alone or in collaboration with others, pursues their own unique version of &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhatDoIDoNext.pdf"&gt;skeptical activism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted folks who looked friendly and inviting (this is an ad series, after all) but who also embodied the best of the new skepticism. I wanted folks who were doing things, helping people, defining the new landscape — and I wanted to use the platform of Skeptic.com to showcase their independent efforts. Think of this as a small, just-for-fun part of a larger conversation about win-win-win methods for traditional skeptical organizations and grassroots skeptics to support each others’ public service projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five of the six faces in the series are female. It happens that I invited men and women in about equal numbers, but I’m perfectly happy with the way things worked out. Today, women are finally closing on parity with men in representation and respect in skepticism (they have always stood out in accomplishment), but I think it does no harm to move the spotlight around from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/"&gt;check out this first series of banner portraits&lt;/a&gt;, and please join me in thanking the models for participating. The six portraits should be served up automatically in random order at the top of Skeptic.com. Just refresh your browser a few times to view them all, or click through to the bios to learn more about a few of the voices of grassroots skepticism!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Daniel Loxton</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268727954137"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4204">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b066de893d373c07</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Book Review"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="decision-making"/><category term="diagnosis"/><category term="errors"/><category term="evidence"/><category term="therapy"/><title type="html">Diagnosis, Therapy and Evidence</title><published>2010-03-16T08:00:03Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T08:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4204" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Novella recently wrote about &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=4178"&gt;plausibility in science-based medicine&lt;/a&gt;, one of our most assiduous commenters, Daedalus2u, added a very important point. The data are always right, but the explanations may be wrong. The idea of treating ulcers with antibiotics was not incompatible with any of the data about ulcers; it was only incompatible with the idea that ulcers were caused by too much acid. Even scientists tend to think on the level of the explanations rather than on the level of the data that led to those explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A valuable new book elaborates on this concept: &lt;a href="http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/acatalog/diagnosis_therapy_and_evidence.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagnosis, Therapy and Evidence: Conundrums in Modern American Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; by medical historian Gerald N. Grob and sociologist Allan V. Horwitz. They point out that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;many claims about the causes of disease, therapeutic practices, and even diagnoses are shaped by beliefs that are unscientific, unproven, or completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we try to be science-based, we are not always as scientific or as logical as we would like to think. We form hypotheses that are compatible with existing data, and then our assumptions guide our thinking and future research and sometimes interfere with our reception of new data. We must recognize those assumptions and constantly re-evaluate them. It’s important that we look the imperfections of science-based medicine squarely in the face if we are going to have any hope of overcoming them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the therapies recommended in a 1927 textbook only 23 were later validated as effective or preventive. The other 211 were subsequently found to be either harmful, useless, of questionable value, or simply symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical treatment has had a big impact on human health, but there’s more to the story. We developed effective treatments for ulcers, but the incidence of ulcers was already declining before those treatments had any impact. The decline of rheumatic heart disease is probably not due to antibiotics but may be due to decreased virulence of the causal bacteria. We have no idea why the incidence of stomach cancer has decreased in the US, or why it is so high in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular concept today is that cancer is largely a preventable illness linked to diet, environmental carcinogens and behavior. This is rooted largely in belief and hope rather than fact. Smoking is the one notable exception. Genetic factors and the many physiologic changes of aging may contribute more than we would like to think. To some extent, disease is an unavoidable consequence of life: the idea that science can eventually provide perfect health may be a chimera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our efforts to prevent heart attacks we are essentially treating risk factors, without a clear understanding of how they relate to pathophysiology. We are treating hypertension, hyperlipidemia and other risk factors rather than directly treating the cause(s) of cardiovascular disease. We offer behavioral prescriptions based on assumptions derived from inadequate epidemiologic evidence, and this kind of thinking can lead us astray. Recommending a low fat diet helped fuel an epidemic of obesity as people replaced the fat in their diet with extra carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have formed a belief we are slow to respond to new evidence that refutes it. The book covers the history of tonsillectomy. Tonsillectomies remained fashionable long after the evidence showed most of them were useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting question they ask is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do diagnoses come into existence and why do many disappear with the passage of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What ever happened to chlorosis and neurasthenia? The same patient presenting with the same symptoms in 1890 and 2010 would get entirely different diagnoses. The ailments that afflict humans don’t change much; our diagnostic categories do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism, CFS and fibromyalgia are all relatively new diagnoses for conditions that undoubtedly existed long before the diagnostic name was coined. “Their pathobiology remains unknown, and there is little agreement on their diagnostic boundaries. Once given a name, however, the numbers given to each diagnosis have expanded exponentially.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric diagnoses are particularly slippery. Where exactly do you draw the line between normal sadness and depression? Disease occurs on a continuum and we try to fit it into discrete boxes. We organize the data differently at different times as influenced by historical circumstances. The &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; (in its many iterations, now up to DSM-5) changes as it reflects not only new data but cultural, social, and political forces. There is no evidence that the new DSM categories of anxiety have improved the diagnosis, treatment, or understanding of anxiety disorders. The popularity of the diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) raises issues about the connection between external causes, individual responses, and resulting symptoms. Broadened criteria for PTSD have made it possible for almost everyone to be diagnosed or considered at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We differentiate between science-based medicine and belief-based medicine, but we mustn’t forget that scientists form beliefs too. Our interpretation of the evidence is influenced by our working hypotheses. We must remember to constantly guard against overinterpretation and to concentrate only on what the evidence actually shows. When we use a diagnosis, we must remember that it is not definitive, but only an artificial category we have imposed on nature to help us understand our patients’ symptoms and provide a framework for treatment decisions. When we have an explanation, we must keep re-evaluating the data to make sure another explanation doesn’t fit the data just as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionannidis showed that most published studies are wrong. Grob and Horwitz show that many of our current diagnoses, treatments, and ideas about disease may be wrong too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that we all repeat the mantra: “I could be wrong” and keep asking “Could any other explanation fit the data?”&lt;/p&gt;

I continue to rag on it because I can&amp;#39;t seem to escape it&amp;#39;s repetitive and forced impingement on my valuable eardrums. Unfortunately, the city doesn&amp;#39;t afford much auditory privacy and some people in the subway are really determined to lose their hearing before old age. Whatever happened to iPod etiquette? According to Oliver Sack&amp;#39;s book Musicophilia I&amp;#39;ve got a bad case of the earworm. This is when a piece of music repeats compulsively in one&amp;#39;s mind. But if I hate the song so much why is my brain constantly replaying it over and over again??? Is it the &amp;quot;I shouldn&amp;#39;t peak at that morbid car accident, but I just can&amp;#39;t help it&amp;quot; syndrome? Sacks similarly asks: What is happening psychologically and neurologically, when a tune or a jingle takes possession of one like this? What are the characteristics that make a tune or a song &amp;#39;dangerous or &amp;#39;infectious&amp;#39; in this way? Is it some oddity of sound, of timbre or rhythm or melody? Is it repetition? Or is it arousal of special emotional resonances or associations? To give the song SOME credit, I don&amp;#39;t necessarily abhor the tune as much as I do the ridiculous lyrics. Sacks is onto something here when he makes mention of rhythm and repetition. &amp;quot;Poker Face&amp;quot; has an absurd amount of repetition. The word &amp;quot;mum&amp;quot; is repeated 40 times in the song! (A link on how to get rid of earworm, wish I had found it sooner)In any case, have you ever wondered how the brain actually processes lyrics and tunes? There&amp;#39;s a hot debate as to whether they are represented as separate components or integrated throughout...but since New Scientist seems to have already covered the paper (doh! I just found out a second ago)...I leave you with a snippet of Sammler et. al&amp;#39;s abstract published in the latest issue of The Journal of Neuroscience. I also leave you with a trap...to infect you with an earworm of your own! (...or at least irritate you) MUAHAHAHA. Misery loves company. ...the left mid-STS showed an interaction of the adaptation effects for lyrics and tunes, suggesting an integrated processing of the two components at prelexical, phonemic processing levels. The degree of integration decayed toward more anterior regions of the left STS, where the lack of such an interaction and the stronger adaptation for lyrics than for tunes was suggestive of an independent processing of lyrics, perhaps resulting from the processing of meaning. Finally, evidence for an integrated representation of lyrics and tunes was found in the left dorsal precentral gyrus (PrCG), possibly relating to the build-up of a vocal code for singing in which musical and linguistic features of song are fused. Overall, these results demonstrate that lyrics and tunes are processed at varying degrees of integration (and separation) through the consecutive processing levels allocated along the posterior–anterior axis of the left STS and the left PrCG.Sacks, O.

&lt;p&gt;As I said we keep on working. while you and your kangaroo committee put on a  good show. Try to take this one to the cleaners and more and more people will  begin to see the fools that you really are. I hope western medicine saved  you for your health crisis but that maybe when you depart you will see the how  your bitterness twisted things and made you suffer so.
	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may  recall the expose in which homeopaths in the UK were caught, in 2006, recommending their sugar pills for prevention of malaria, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=22"&gt;Lethal advice from homeopaths about malaria prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may remember the saga of the taking down of Andy Lewis’s classic post in 2007 on &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/canardnoir.htm"&gt;The Gentle Art of Homeopathic Killing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this, in 2008, the trendy Covent Garden company, Neal’s Yard, tried marketing a homeopathic malaria &amp;quot;remedy&amp;quot;.  The quackometer’s post &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/04/neals-yard-remedies-offers-lethal.html"&gt;Neal’s   Yard Remedies Offers Lethal Homeopathic Malaria Advice&lt;/a&gt; is a corker.  Under pressure they withdrew the “remedy” (see &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/04/neals-yard-ethical-bullshit-remedy.html"&gt;Neal’s  Yard Ethical Bullshit Remedy &lt;/a&gt;.  Eventually Neal’s Yard was censured by the MHRA ( &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/05/neals-yard-remedies-rapped-by-medicines.html"&gt;Neal’s Yard Remedies ‘rapped by medicines regulator’&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=24"&gt;Kate Birch&lt;/a&gt; of the North American Society of Homeopaths, who advocates sugar pills for every disease under the sun (and &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=43"&gt;follow-up  to these claims&lt;/a&gt;).   Memorably, she visited me in late 2007 and gave me a copy of her book.  &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=172"&gt;A visit from Kate Birch&lt;/a&gt; sitll comes top of the front page if you google ‘kate birch homeopath’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attached to the unfriendly letter was a &lt;a href="http://abhalight.org/products/malarix.html"&gt;web page from Abha Light&lt;/a&gt;.  It  is an advertisement for a homeopathic malaria treatment.  As far as I can see, it doesn’t say anywhere what the “remedy” contains, but that doesn’t matter if, as in most homeopathic products, it contains nothing whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/malarix1.jpg" alt="malarix1" width="500" height="444"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This document contains a direct claim that the treatment &amp;quot;has been successfully been used to prevent and treat malaria . . .&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/malarix2.jpg" alt="malarix2"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There follows more utter fantasy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/malarix3.jpg" alt="malarix3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonsense like this would be a joke if it were not for the fact that they must be killing people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Fisher, clinical director the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=130"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, of the original malaria scandal, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very angry about it because people are going to get malaria – there is absolutely no reason to think that homeopathy works to prevent malaria and you won’t find that in any textbook or journal of homeopathy so people will get malaria, people may even die of malaria if they follow this advice”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most quasi-religious subjects, homeopathy is split into sects, at war with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’m sure that it must work because Kristie Alley would never promote a weight loss plan that didn’t and she has such a great track record for these sorts of things. Which is obvious since she’s still fat to this very day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:319px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/7/2010/03/500x_alley.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/7/2010/03/500x_alley.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="219"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristie Alley after &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; weight loss plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that she’s now promoting a new weight loss  plan should speak volumes of how successful Jenny Craig was in the  long-term and, for that matter, how successful any weight loss plan  other than simple calorie restriction (the only scientifically proven method) is in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway,  as clearly unreliable as Alleys’ weight loss endorsements have already  proven (which didn’t stop Oprah from letting Alley use her show to  promote), let’s take a look at this “Organic Liaison.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://forums.whyweprotest.net/1178059-post139/"&gt;Anonymous   have found links&lt;/a&gt; between Organic Liaison LLC and Scientology — the   firm’s accountant, Saul B Lipson, is a known Scientologist whose company   is approved by the church and based near its headquarters in   Clearwater, Florida. Along with utter quacks like &lt;a href="http://trueslant.com/alexpareene/2009/07/09/quack-to-the-stars-dr-soram-khalsa/"&gt;Hollywood   mystical doctor Soram Khalsa&lt;/a&gt;, the board features Michelle Seward,   an active Scientologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is not enough to support  Anonymous’ claim that money from  Organic Liaison will be channeled  directly into the church, it does lend  credence to the assertion that  the program itself is, to some extent,  based on a Scientology plan  called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purification_Rundown"&gt;the   purification rundown&lt;/a&gt;. This was prescribed by L. Ron Hubbard himself,   but criticized for being at best bullshit that claims to detox through   vitamins, minerals, drinking vegetable oil and sitting in saunas, and  at  worst dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.organicliaison.com/intro"&gt;Organic Liaison&lt;/a&gt; offers  to combine an organic food diet with “organic and natural diet   supplements that replenish your body with essential vitamins, minerals   and nutrients without the pangs of starvation or cravings you may have   felt on other diet plans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly priced like a  Scientology scam. Membership costs $10  per month, or $89 for a year,  and the package of supplements, called  Rescue Me, is a whopping $139  per month. One you’ve ordered the kit, it  auto-ships and bills your  card again every month until you stop it. &lt;a href="http://www.organicliaison.com/store/Rescue-Me-kit/"&gt;The kit   contains&lt;/a&gt; three supplements, Rescue Me (claimed detox and appetite   suppresser), Release Me (claimed relaxant) and Nightingale (claimed   sleep aid), featuring many cheaply-available vitamins, minerals, amino   acids, herbs and aids like vitamin C, folic acid, L-Tryptophan, fiber,   green tea, calcium and magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also offers other  supplements — notably Relieve Me, an  anti-constipation supplement that  Anonymous claim is related to Cal-Mag,  a noxious-sounding dietary  liquid developed by Hubbard that contains  calcium, magnesium, vinegar  and hot water. And that led some of those  church members forced to  drink it to, um, relieve themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence, while suggestive,  is by no means conclusive. What is  safe to say is that thousands,  millions even, of people will be  over-paying for unproven herbal  supplements combined with a common-sense  diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how could they be jamming us. . .if they don’t know we’re coming? Yeah, I smell trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former high-ranking $cientology explains why high-ranking $cientologists are usually giant fat-asses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rev. Shan Rutherford, pastor of Greenwood Christian Church for more  than three decades, said he disagrees with the proposition that such a  prayer would violate a student’s rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I lived in a Muslim nation, a Hindu nation or anything else, I  would expect to go along with the majority,” Rutherford said. “He’s  trying to go with minority rule. To me, that’s wrong in a democracy, one  that was founded on Christian principles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t agree, I don’t think you should try to stop other  people from exercising their rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d pay real money to see this guy prayer to Allah or Vishnu right now. Who is he kidding? I think we all know this guy would sooner jump off a bridge to his death before praying to another god.&lt;/p&gt;

And in retaliation for her going to the ACLU, they made sure it wasn’t exactly a secret as to why they canceled prom. Well, I hope they’re very proud of that decision because it’s now going to land them in court. Not only is the ACLU not backing down but the brave teen is standing up for principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All I wanted was the same chance to enjoy my prom night like any other  student. But my school would rather hurt all the students than treat  everyone fairly,” said the student, 18-year-old Constance McMillen, in  an &lt;a href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/american_civil_liberties_union"&gt;ACLU&lt;/a&gt; news release. “This isn’t just about me  and my rights anymore — now I’m fighting for the right of all the  students at my school to have our prom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

First the good news. &lt;a href="http://www.atheist.ie/2010/03/ahern-proposes-referendum-on-blasphemy-this-autumn/"&gt;Ireland’s government is having second thoughts about the blasphemy law&lt;/a&gt; they passed last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dermot Ahern, the justice minister, is proposing that a vote to  remove the criminal offence of blasphemy be held as part of a planned  series of referendums this autumn, writes Stephen O’Brien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahern, who was criticised for increasing the fine for blasphemy to  €25,000 last year, said he never regarded the provision in the new  Defamation Bill as anything more than a short-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of nonsense about that blasphemy issue and people  making me out to be a complete right-winger at the time,” he said.  “There was an incredibly sophisticated campaign [against me], mainly on  the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not against you, Dermot. About your fascist policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I categorized the other news story as “bad news” but because it involves something bad that happened a long time ago being exposed, I guess it’s kind of also good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/47468000/jpg/_47468725__46811870_008215068-1-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/47468000/jpg/_47468725__46811870_008215068-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="170"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yup, I’m talking about &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8567144.stm"&gt;more child abuse covered up by a high-ranking official in the Catholic Church&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Sean Brady, primate of all-Ireland, admitted he was present at  meetings where two abused teenagers were made to sign vows of silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in case you’re outraged that this got away with directly participating in the covering up of a crime as heinous as child rape, rest assured that Cardinal Brady assures us that this is not a big deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Frankly I don’t believe that this is a  resigning matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See. What’s wrong with you people. The Church does this sort of thing all the time. It’s not a big deal. It’s not like they married people of the same sex. It was just raping children…sexy, sexy children.&lt;/p&gt;

This past weekend I hit up &lt;a href="http://kawakon.com/"&gt;Kawa Kon&lt;/a&gt; here in St. Louis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kawa's a fairly new con and only has about 1,000 attendees. But this was actually one of the better cons I've been to. As usual, I volunteered myself in any way I was needed. This meant I helped run the game room which, for the most part, was just donating a fistfull of equipment, assisting in the setting and running of a Smash Brothers tournament, and just hanging around to keep an eye on stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This generally works well for me since there's rarely panels at cons I find worth attending. I can't stand panels that are too much attendee generated discussion. It inevitably becomes about 1 or 2 people grand standing while everyone else sits around. I much prefer lecture style panels which are generally far more organized with less grand standing (assuming the host actually knows what they're talking about). But such panels are uncommon at cons around here and typically on topics I'm not interested in. So panels don't usually interest me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were a few other events I did want to attend. The first was the Vampire Ball. This was a formal type ball with a vampire theme. That theme wasn't apparent anywhere except the name though. Naka did a similar event which was fun, but ultimately proved to be awkward since no one (myself included) knew much about formal dancing (despite me taking lessons at KU for a semester; it's all gone now). So it ended up being the stand and sway dance while people without dates sat around the edges. At Kawa's ball, they had a few designated people teaching the basic waltz steps and going around to help people and pull them off the walls. This greatly helped the atmosphere although I was disappointed that the dress code wasn't enforced. Guys in jeans and a tee just didn't cut it. Meanwhile there was an amazing Jareth from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_%28film%29"&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt; hosting it who I chatted with for a good long time the next evening (after she did the Dread Pirate Roberts from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29"&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main event I was wanting to attend, however, was the cosplay competition. This is always the highlight of cons to me. Halloween is my favorite holiday simply because I love costuming. So getting to see the costumes of others and show off my own is great. For this competition, I took my &lt;a href="http://inuyasha.wikia.com/wiki/Sessh%C5%8Dmaru"&gt;Sesshomaru&lt;/a&gt; costume from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuyasha"&gt;Inuyasha&lt;/a&gt;. I started this costume in late 2008 and finished it for Ohayocon in Jan 2009. Rabid fan girls destroyed some parts of it there and I made a few quick fixes for Naka 2009 where I wore it as the host of the cosplay competition there. But it's been in need of some serious overhauls for a long time. Namely, the armor hadn't turned out as well as I wanted and didn't work. It was made from cardboard and pleather so it sagged and had unsightly creases. The spikes around the shoulder had all been broken off (thanks to the fan girls) and needed to be made from stronger stuff and more securely fastened. Additionally, the bow was falling apart and needed to be hand stitched to really keep it together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fixed these things by completely redoing the armor using thick, heat-formed styrene and putting it all together with bolts and rivets instead of glue and duct tape. Additionally, I asked a friend of mine to come do my makeup since she was a costume design major for a time and does fantastic work. The new work I did on the costume added another 20+ hours to the already 100+ that had gone into the costume and the makeup took another 1.5 hours just before the contest. But it paid off. The applause was easily the largest of the entire show and I walked away with the top prize: Best in Show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That night I went to the dance party for awhile and danced with a friend I made while standing in line for the costume competition and then went and chilled at Karaoke. After that closed up, I hung in the game room with some people and played a nice game of drunken Apples to Apples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunday I ended up sleeping to noon thanks to staying up playing + the time change and didn't have much time to hang around since the con was ending. So I grabbed my equipment from the game room and walked around a bit more. I chatted with a few people and won a prize at closing ceremonies (by being the first person to pull a $2 bill. I always carry one around in my messenger bag for some reason).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, it was a wonderful time and I can't wait to start a new costume and hit up another con.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img height="80%" width="80%" src="http://s94958815.onlinehome.us/costuming/Sesshomaru/kawa1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-7608762696511564599?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268717532196"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7251e3d4d4f56da0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Just Like a Woman</title><published>2010-03-16T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/history/titanic/woman.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did a man sneak his way onto one of the Titanic's lifeboats by donning women's dress?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268715299473"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=22507">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9eefc1041880586c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">God Gets Around</title><published>2010-03-16T04:32:48Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T04:32:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2010/03/15/god-gets-around/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh, sure, it makes no sense when you put it like *that*…&lt;/p&gt;

This is the daily &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; of parenting and you may feel it doesn&amp;#39;t make a difference. Well, turns out, it does make a difference! A recent study from the University of Montreal and the University of Minnesota shows that how parents interact with young children helps them develop crucial cognitive skills. Here&amp;#39;s a brief overview of the study:- researchers studied 80 pairs of moms and their one-year-old children- the study focused on how moms interacted with their children in tasks such as playing games or putting together puzzles- the researchers examined how these interactions predicted children&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;advanced cognitive functions&amp;quot;--those are things like controlling impulses, remembering things and having mental flexibilityIt turns out that how moms interact with their children in these tasks help the child develop these important cognitive skills. Children whose moms who interacted in the following ways had better cognitive skills at 18-26 months:- provided guidance and scaffolding in tasks that were difficult for the child but did not take over the do the task for him/her- followed the child lead and pace in completing the task or playing the game- used a warm and sensitive tone when interacting with the childOne of the most important findings of the study was that these types of interactions helped support the child&amp;#39;s autonomous behavior--that is, the child learns to do activities on their own. This is crucial because autonomy helps the child develop a sense of self and accomplishment.So parents if you had any doubt that the little things you do everyday matter, worry no more. All those moments of guidance and support really do help your child become an independent, competent youngster.For other commentary on this study click here.Bernier, A., Carlson, S., &amp;amp; Whipple, N.

They've got a fancy pants new layout, some improved functionality, and the blogs each have multiple tabs.  One of the tabs is a "&lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/policy.html"&gt;policy tab&lt;/a&gt;" with the following policy on each blog:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don't post content in languages other than English&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nature Network is an English language website. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This policy is not new; it&amp;#39;s been a Nature Network policy since before the upgrade.  It&amp;#39;s just that now it seems much more prominent.  Perhaps this is a sensitive subject for me.  You see, although I blog here in English, sometimes, in my life, science looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/latinas%20in%20science.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="latinas in science.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/assets_c/2010/03/latinas%20in%20science-thumb-400x300-42787.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto 20px;text-align:center;display:block" height="300" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1: Science in Spanish.  These lovely ladies are from &lt;a href="http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/news/images/biosphere_Winter-2003-2004-p13-Figure2-Latina-students-in-lab%20class_sm_l.jpg"&gt;UCSD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really dislike the idea of forcing a single science language. It establishes an &amp;quot;us versus them&amp;quot; mentality and creates a power dichotomy between those who speak the language natively and those who must learn it to participate.  It is a rare, rare occasion when a native English speaker must learn a new language to be able to interact with scientists in their field.  Conversely, it is always assumed that the non-English speaker must learn English if they are serious about engaging in science.  Indeed, if I had a dollar for every time a white colleague told me, &amp;quot;that paper&amp;#39;s not in English.  It&amp;#39;s not important...&amp;quot;  Clearly, serious science is always conducted in English. That other language is just what you speak at home with &amp;quot;your people.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, there&amp;#39;s a lot of fantastic work being done and written about in languages other than English.  For example, check out &lt;a href="http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/10chile/welcome.html"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; documenting a group of oceanographers doing research along the Chilean coast.  The content is in Spanish, but an English translation is available.  ScienceBlogs also has a network of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com.br/"&gt;Brazilian bloggers&lt;/a&gt; with content available in Portuguese.  Carlos Hotta offers English translations of the site&amp;#39;s highlights &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com.br/brazillion/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but Google Translate is often sufficient to get the point of many of the posts.  One of my favorite blogs is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com.br/eccemedicus/?utm_source=bloglist&amp;amp;utm_medium=brazildropdown"&gt;Ecce Medicus&lt;/a&gt;. This recent post about medical animation included &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com.br/eccemedicus/2010/03/uma_propaganda_que_vale_a_pena.php"&gt;an amazing video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s very easy to forget about our scientist brothers and sisters who may not share our language.  That&amp;#39;s why I read, with interest, a website sent to me in the last few days by dear friend of the blog &lt;a href="http://scientistmother.blogspot.com/"&gt;ScientistMother&lt;/a&gt;.  In this appeal for help, Miguel Allende, Director of the Center for Genomics of the Cell in Chile writes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mileniocgc.cl/"&gt;Center for Genomics of the Cell&lt;/a&gt; affected by 
earthquake in Chile
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;March 5 , 2010. Updated March 
12.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We regret to inform that several of the labs belonging to the CGC 
have been severely damaged by the high magnitude earthquake that affected 
central and southern Chile last Saturday, Feb, 27th. Specifically, the labs of 
CGC Director Miguel Allende and Investigators Verónica Palma and Alvaro Glavic, 
whose labs are located at the Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Chile, 
suffered significant damage and loss of equipment and materials. Besides the physical impact caused 
by falling, there was flooding due to a broken water main which further 
increased the damage. Losses are estimated in the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars and work will likely be interrupted for weeks or perhaps longer. More 
seriously, irreplaceable reagents, stocks, samples and experiments were 
lost.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are not the only 
developmental biology labs affected by this catastrophe. Our colleagues in 
Concepción (e.g., Sylvain Marcellini, Marcela Torrejón, Juan Olate) and others 
in Santiago (Alexander Vargas, Ariel Reyes) were similarly affected and have 
also sustained significant losses describing the damage in 
Sylvain Marcellini's lab at the Universidad de Concepción). Developmental 
biology in Chile is a growing and vibrant discipline; over the past few years, 
they have become one of the most significant and productive groups in this area 
within the Latin American region.A large investment in these groups had been 
made both with the support of Chilean government funds and international grants. 
We express our solidarity with these investigators and we call on the 
international community of developmental biologists to come to the aid of these 
labs. Several Societies (SDB, ISDB, LASDB) have already taken action. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A large number of 
colleagues around the world have offered to help with the replacement of lost 
equipment and by hosting CGC students in their labs until the situation is 
normalized. We sincerely thank all of these generous offers for assistance in 
these difficult times. Anyone wishing to collaborate should coordinate with the 
Vice-rector for Research at the Universidad de Chile, Dr. Daniel Wolff. We know 
that efforts are being made in Europe, the US, Japan and Australia already, so 
it would be ideal to coordinate among the different donating institutions or 
individuals. We are exploring ways in which to finance transport of such 
materials and therefore, this should not be a concern to donor institutions or 
individuals. Please &lt;a href="mailto:allende@uchile.cl"&gt;contact Miguel Allende 
&lt;/a&gt;regarding these matters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To provide an idea of the type of equipment 
that needs to be replaced, we have compiled a list of the principal items that 
were lost or seriously damaged (for many, we still don't know the cost of 
repairing them to determine whether it is worthwhile to do 
so):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fluorescence Dissecting scope, (Olympus MVX10 with 4 filter sets, 1X 
and 2X objectives)&lt;br&gt;Digital camera for microscopy (Leica DFC300FX)&lt;br&gt;Zeiss 
Fluorescence microscope&lt;br&gt;Laminar flow hood for cell culture &lt;br&gt;Cell culture 
CO2 incubator&lt;br&gt;Inverted microscope for cell culture use&lt;br&gt;Dissecting scope 
with teaching oculars (Leica)&lt;br&gt;3 dissecting scopes for microinjection of 
embryos&lt;br&gt;Light sources for dissection microscopes&lt;br&gt;Tabletop refrigerated 
centrifuge, rotors OK (Beckman)&lt;br&gt;Eppendorf Centrifuge&lt;br&gt;Analytical balance 
and pH meter&lt;br&gt;Gel 
documentation system with digital camera&lt;br&gt;3 pressure microinjectors (2 MMPI, 1 
Narshige) with micromanipulators&lt;br&gt;Culture flask shaker&lt;br&gt;PCR machine (Perkin 
Elmer)&lt;br&gt;Capillary glass puller (Narshige)&lt;br&gt;Power supply and gel chambers 
(agarose and acrylamide)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a large number of miscellaneous smaller 
items that are typical of developmental biology labs, but that are more likely 
to be replaced locally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will try to expand this list to include the 
needs of the other Chilean developmental biologists that were similarly 
affected. We are also trying to establish a monetary fund to receive cash 
donations and we will try to make this information available as soon as 
possible. For now, it is possible to make cash donations in the U. S. through 
the &lt;a href="http://sdbonline.org/"&gt;Society for Developmental Biology (SDB)&lt;/a&gt;; 
contact is &lt;a href="mailto:ichow@sdbonline.org"&gt;Ida Chow&lt;/a&gt;. In Europe, 
coordination is being carried out by &lt;a href="mailto:r.mayor@ucl.ac.uk"&gt;Roberto 
Mayor&lt;/a&gt; at UCL, London.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We thank all of our friends 
around the world for their words of encouragement and material 
support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miguel Allende&lt;br&gt;CGC Director&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That led me to a web search that convinced me that &lt;em&gt;disprefer&lt;/em&gt; is (1) widely used in linguistics, (2) not listed in the &lt;em&gt;OED, American Heritage,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/em&gt; online dictionaries, and (3) abhorred by some prescriptivists.   This post is about to turn into another of those Language Log rants about some prescriptivist&amp;#39;s blunders.   My excuse for adding to this already copious genre?  In this case the self-appointed critic aims his barbs directly at &amp;quot;linguists and their lackeys,&amp;quot; (Yeah, really) who he describes as &amp;quot;idiotic&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;disaffected… from sense and thoughtfulness.&amp;quot;   When a guy calls you names like that and then gets three out of four of his examples wrong, it&amp;#39;s hard to keep a civil tongue, but I&amp;#39;ll try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Hartwell Fiske writes (in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KRJSv9oI3EkC&amp;amp;lpg=PA119&amp;amp;ots=lYqDb8_tge&amp;amp;dq=%22Among%20linguists%20and%20their%20lackeys%22&amp;amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%22Among%20linguists%20and%20their%20lackeys%22&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dictionary of Disagreeable English&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2006, p. 119:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"DISPREFER: Idiotic for &lt;strong&gt;dislike&lt;/strong&gt; (or similar words)." &lt;/span&gt; He continues with four (attested?) examples and their proposed corrections.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;1. *It's interesting as a spelling pronunciation, preferred by some speakers, &lt;strong&gt;dispreferred&lt;/strong&gt; by others. USE &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; Fiske fails to note that dispreferred expresses a contrary negation, not simply a contradictory one.  The writer is excluding the possibility that the dispreferring speakers might be merely indifferent to the pronunciation in question, but the use of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; would include that possibility.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;2. *They never spontaneously produce them; in fact, they strongly &lt;strong&gt;disprefer&lt;/strong&gt; them. USE &lt;strong&gt;object to&lt;/strong&gt;.*&lt;/span&gt; The word &lt;em&gt;produce&lt;/em&gt; indicates spoken language and spoken choices are rarely conscious. Since &lt;em&gt;object to&lt;/em&gt; presupposes conscious choice, it would not be apt here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;3. *In a pinch you can fax it to me at [apparently a real fax number], but I &lt;strong&gt;disprefer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;faxes because of deficient legibility. USE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dislike&lt;/strong&gt;.*&lt;/span&gt; The writer intends that he or she prefers other media of communication to faxes. &lt;em&gt;Disprefer&lt;/em&gt; does that job directly; &lt;em&gt;dislike&lt;/em&gt; indirectly at best.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;4. *Other things being equal, we should &lt;strong&gt;disprefer&lt;/strong&gt; blogs to journalism. USE &lt;strong&gt;prefer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;journalism to blogs.* &lt;/span&gt;I can't say he's clearly wrong about this one, depending on the information structure of discourse or text.  If blogs are the topic, there's a lot to be said for making it the direct object rather than an oblique, the object of a preposition.  On the other hand, if there's no strong information structure motivation, there's no reason to use the less frequent and more technical verb. I won't score this one as an error for Fiske, though I suspect it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Hartwell Fiske's summary: &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Among linguists and their lackeys, &lt;strong&gt;disaffected&lt;/strong&gt; as they often are from sense and thoughtfulness, &lt;strong&gt;disprefer&lt;/strong&gt; actually does exist. No sentence is improved, none made true or clear, by using &lt;strong&gt;disprefer&lt;/strong&gt; instead of some other wording." &lt;/span&gt;No sentence, Mr. Fiske?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case at least "disagreeable" applies better to the author  of the criticism than the object.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Paul Kay</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268705261883"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/atheists_photographing_atheist.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b68508f8a9842972</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Atheists photographing atheists</title><published>2010-03-16T02:14:07Z</published><updated>2010-03-16T02:14:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Ceb_ODao_N0/atheists_photographing_atheist.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/atheists_photographing_atheist.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I seem to have spent a lot of time at the Global Atheist Conference with cameras pointed at me.

There has been one fatality attributed* to 4-MMC that I can find and a few bits of seized-drug analysis confirming that the stuff is indeed being used. A quick scan over at PubMed finds little reported on the effects of this compound in animal models or in humans. I did, however, run across an article on other cathinone analog drugs that caught my attention. 

The newpaper reports on 4-MMC coming out of the UK, for the most part, are experiencing the usual difficulty in characterizing the subjective properties of an analog of a stimulant class of drugs. This not dissimilar to the case of MDMA and relatives such as MDA, MDEA/MDE which are structurally similar to amphetamine and methamphetamine but convey subtly different subjective properties. This gives me an opportunity to talk about an animal model used quite a bit in drug abuse studies: The drug-discrimination assay. Since the news reporting 

Cathinone: an investigation of several N-alkyl and methylenedioxy-substituted analogs. Dal Cason TA, Young R, Glennon RA. Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1997 Dec;58(4):1109-16. (DOI) In this case, for example, the rats were trained to discriminate 1.0 d-amphetamine (d-AMP) from saline. The drug (or saline vehicle) was administered by intraperitoneal injection and then the animal was placed in the operant chamber and allowed to respond on two levers to produce a delivery of sweetened powdered milk. When d-AMP was administered before the session one lever produced reward and this became the drug-associated lever for that animal (left/right was balanced across the group). Presses on the other lever were rewarded under saline conditions. 

The critical step in this assay is that responses on the levers in the first 2.5 minutes of the session did not produce any consequences. Animals were considered trained when they made over 80% of their responses during this test interval on the drug-appropriate lever after receiving 1.0 d-AMP and less than 20% on the drug-appropriate lever after receiving saline. Once trained, animals are challenged with either different doses of the training drug or different drugs entirely. The procedure is interpreted as giving an indication of how similar the subjective properties of a drug is to the training drug and how potent that drug is relative to the training drug. 

In this paper, the authors investigated the subjective properties of several cathinone analog compounds including N-Monoethylcathinone (N-Et CAT),  N-mono-n-propylcathinone (N-Pr CAT), and N,N-dimethylcathinone (Di Me CAT), 3,4-Methylenedioxycathinone (MDC) and  3,4-Methylenedioxymethcathinone (MDMC). I have taken the liberty of graphing the data provided in tabular form in the paper. 

As you can see in the graph, as you decrease the dose of the training drug, the rats are less and less likely to &amp;quot;report&amp;quot; that they have been given the active training drug. This is a classic feature of the assay. In terms of the cathinone analogs under investigation, four of them would substitute for the training drug if you pushed the dose high enough. Notice that in all cases the necessary dose was higher on a mg/kg basis than the training dose of d-AMP. One compound (MDC) did not fully substitute for d-AMP; part of the reason for this is that beyond the graphed dose range, the animals were behaviorally disrupted- i.e., they didn&amp;#39;t make more than 5 total responses (on either lever) in the initial test interval. 

So cathinone analogs are producing subjective properties similar to amphetamine in many cases, all well and good. At this point you are screaming that sure, this procedure just asks the animal to report if it is intoxicated on a drug or not. Unfortunately I don&amp;#39;t have the time or inclination to go through the arguments step by step so I&amp;#39;ll refer you back to the drug-discrimination database for the moment. 

I did want to highlight two papers from Goodwin and Baker (here, here) that took the modestly unusual step of training rats to discriminate d-AMP and MDMA from saline using a three-lever setup. The take home here is that by using this procedure you can get the rats to report d-AMP classic stimulant-like effects differently from serotonin-mediated classic hallucinogen effects. The data confirm in a rat model that MDMA does indeed share stimulant and hallucinogen-like properties**.  (Man, I wish more people would use this three-lever procedure.)

Returning the Dal Cason paper, we see that they also conducted another study in which the rats were initially trained to discriminate 1.5 mg/kg MDMA from saline and then tested on the methylenedioxycathinone and methylenedioxymethcathinone compounds. In this case 77% MDMA-like responding was produced at only 2 mg/kg of MDC and the 93% considered full substitution at 2.25 mg/kg.  In contrast MDC did not substitute fully for d-AMP, producing the most d-AMP-like responding of 58% at 2.75 mg/kg. The MDMC compound produced full substitution for MDMA at 2 mg/kg (98% MDMA-appropriate) and nearly full substitution (77%) at 1.75 mg/kg. This drug produced full substitution for d-AMP at 3 mg/kg and 69% drug-appropriate responding at 2.75 mg/kg. Although this between-groups procedure is not as elegant as the three-lever paradigm, still we have some evidence here for how subjective properties of several cathinone analogs shake out in a behaving animal. 

I&amp;#39;m hoping a lab or two is busily working on 4-MMC so we can start getting some data on the behavioral pharmacological properties of this drug which appears to be gaining popularity in the UK at the moment.

Accordingly, many scientists want to understand how their mind works. To gain insights into the complex minds of cephalopods, researchers have been studying behavior in individual animals for years by presenting different animals with various visual stimuli. But many of the methods have downsides - for example, if you want to see how an octopus reacts to another octopus, you can add an octopus to the tank, but doing so introduces other variables. There may be variation in response based on how the introduced octopus looks, moves, etc, and these factors are hard to control. Ideally, you&amp;#39;d want something that you could repeat exactly every time - like a movie.When researchers have tried in the past to use movies to stimulate behavioral responses, however, they found that the octopuses didn&amp;#39;t respond. They weren&amp;#39;t sure exactly why. Mirrors and pictures revealed that octopuses can clearly see the 2-D images, so that&amp;#39;s not the issue. It was as if they just weren&amp;#39;t interested in videos.Dr. Renata Pronk and her colleagues from Macquarie University had a theory - they thought that the octopuses didn&amp;#39;t believe them. Cephalopods rely heavily on their sight, and their vision is highly developed, so it&amp;#39;s possible that the animals easily realized that poor quality videos weren&amp;#39;t real life. If this were the case, Pronk realized, octpuses might respond to the breakthrough visuals of HDTV.To test this hypothesis, she collected wild gloomy octopuses (Octopus tetricus) and subjected them to high-definition videos of things that might interest an octopus - a tasty crab, another octopus, or a jar to play with. Incredibly, when she played the first video of a crab for her first test octopus, it grabbed at the screen. HDTV fooled it! Heres a video of a thoroughly-tricked octopus c/o New Scientist:With their method working, the researchers tested 31 octopuses on 3 different days over a ten-day period to see if their behaviors varied temporally. Furthermore, they compared the individual animals, to look for evidence of personalities. Behavioral biologists define a &amp;quot;personality&amp;quot; as behavioral differences between individuals that are  consistent over time and across ecologically important contexts. In other words, Pronk wanted to know if some octopuses are consistently more aggressive or passive than others when exposed to the same situation. The researchers found that the octopuses did react differently from each other, but they also reacted differently on different days. Some days they were highly reactive, other days they were less so. There was no consistent reaction from a given octopus. These data suggest that octopuses have what is called &amp;quot;episodic personalities.&amp;quot; This means that they do show differences in behavior between individuals, but they also show differences over time. This isn&amp;#39;t necessarily &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; or suggest they are &amp;quot;less intelligent.&amp;quot; Indeed, this may be a sign of their intellect - after all, humans exhibit individual and temporal variation in behavioral response, too.Moreover, this study gives biologists a new method to study octopus behavior. Of course, the most important questions have yet to be answered - like which American Idol contestant the octopuses will root for, or whether they will detest Jersey Shore as much as I do.*Not Octopi. I was very disappointed to learn that it&amp;#39;s not Octopi.Citation:Pronk, R., Wilson, D., &amp;amp; Harcourt, R. (2010).

&lt;br&gt;(The family stares at her.)
&lt;br&gt;Lisa (dejected): Go, Dad, go. &lt;i&gt;-The Simpsons&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Last week, I got a question from one of my online friends, &lt;a href="http://gameknot.com/stats.pl?cmgraves"&gt;cmgraves&lt;/a&gt;.  His question was straightforward:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/dn14364-1_640.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/dn14364-1_640-thumb-500x357-42756.jpg" width="500" height="357" alt="dn14364-1_640.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do &lt;b&gt;thrusters&lt;/b&gt; work in space?  On Earth, when we want to speed up, slow down, change our direction, or to change our motion in general, we &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; have something to push against.  This is true whether you're a runner and have the ground to push against,
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/bolt-start-line.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/bolt-start-line-thumb-500x312-42758.jpg" width="500" height="312" alt="bolt-start-line.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or a turbofan engine with the air to push against.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/j10_6_large.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/j10_6_large-thumb-500x302-42760.jpg" width="500" height="302" alt="j10_6_large.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the vacuum of space, your attempts to fly a plane would fail just as surely as your attempts to run, since &lt;i&gt;there's nothing to push against!&lt;/i&gt;  How, then, is it possible to change your motion in space?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, how do thrusters work?  Take a look at the image below.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/initial_explosion.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/initial_explosion-thumb-500x633-42762.jpg" width="500" height="633" alt="initial_explosion.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when you explode a little bit of rocket fuel inside that rocket.  Note the big difference between what happens here, &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; of a rocket, and what happens when you just blow up something up on its own.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/NHR%20Explosion.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/NHR%20Explosion-thumb-500x333-42764.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="NHR Explosion.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I just let something explode, the explosion is going to move spherically outwards.  For every little bit that moves to the left, there's a little corresponding chunk that moves to the right.  For every gram that moves up with a certain velocity, there's a corresponding amount that moves down with a certain velocity.  This is what we call the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum#Conservation_of_linear_momentum"&gt;conservation of momentum&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if I have a &lt;i&gt;controlled&lt;/i&gt; explosion, I can spew all of that combusted fuel out -- at a very high speed -- in one direction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/ap15-S71-41810HR.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/ap15-S71-41810HR-thumb-500x624-42767.jpg" width="500" height="624" alt="ap15-S71-41810HR.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of that high-velocity, combusted fuel gets blown out &lt;i&gt;in a controlled direction&lt;/i&gt;!  And if I want to accelerate, all I have to do is point my thruster in the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; direction I want to move, burn a little fuel, and I'm done!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2010/03/thrusters_in_space/NASA-NEXT-ion-propulsion-engine-thumb-550x434-21964.jpg" width="500" alt="NASA-NEXT-ion-propulsion-engine-thumb-550x434-21964.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same reason why, when you fire a rifle, there's a large kickback that throws you backwards.  There's an explosion that goes on inside of the gun, &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the energy propels the bullet forwards (out of the barrel) at a certain velocity, and &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the energy propels the gun and everything it's attached to (including &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;) backwards at a different, smaller velocity.

&lt;p&gt;So, to recap, there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; something to push against, but it's all going on &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; of the spaceship.  Something gets shot out of the back, and the rest of it gets accelerated forwards.

When asked to play totally anonymous games in which we can cheat without anyone else ever finding out, very often we don&amp;#39;t.Instead, we play the game fairly, which results in a cost to ourselves (compared with what we could&amp;#39;ve had) and a benefit to the stranger. That&amp;#39;s a mystery because a  evolution says that organisms which don&amp;#39;t act to maximise benefit to themselves - whatever the cost to others - should die out.Several explanations have been put forward, but one of the most intriguing stems from the fact that we live in social networks. In a network like this, we depend critically on the kindness of others.A new study has looked at how altruistic behaviour can be transmitted between players in the kinds of anonymous games that social psychologists are so fond of. The data were from some earlier experiments in which 240 people played the games over six rounds, each time with different partners (all anonymous).What they found was that the amount individuals contributed in one round was affected by how generous their partners were in previous rounds. If they played with generous people in round 1, then they would be more generous to the new partners they had in round 2.In fact, they showed that this effect was propagated through new partners. As you can see in the figure, if Eleni was generous to Lucas, then Lucas would be generous to Erika, and Erika more generous to Jay.Unselfish acts propagated out to 3 degrees of separation. When you remember that only 6 degrees of separation stand between you and every other person on the planet, you can understand how powerful and important this effect is.Even within the terms of the game, this &amp;#39;paying it forward&amp;#39; had a dramatic effect. The magnitude of each action (generous or cheating) was tripled as it rippled through the network. One individual&amp;#39;s generosity in round 1 had a major effect on the benefits reaped by players in later rounds.The infectious nature of altruism might help to explain an anomaly uncovered by previous research. While selfless altruism crops up in these research games when they are played by Westerners, the effect among people from small tribal societies is much less. That might be because Westerners learn this kind of behaviour as a result of the anonymous transactions that are such a central part of life in the West.It might also help to explain how selfless altruism evolved. Earlier, theoretical studies suggest that all you need is that altruistic behaviour can be copied, and that people can leave groups that have too many cheaters. If you are good, then you will benefit in the long run.In other words, it&amp;#39;s good to be good, because what comes around goes around!Fowler, J., &amp;amp; Christakis, N. (2010).

One line of research into regenerative medicine is based on understanding and then recreating in mammals the regenerative powers of lower animals like the salamander or zebrafish. The existence of MRL mice, a laboratory breed originally created for quite different reasons, provides hope that the required genetic or other alterations to mammalian biochemistry are not in fact insurmountably large or complex. Some researchers believe that mammals retain much of the salamander's regenerative capabilities encoded within their genome, and that it is currently only unused or inaccessible rather than completely lost. But onwards: my eye was caught today by an update from Heber-Katz's laboratory, in which the regenerative capacity of MRL mice is matched up to a single genetic deletion: A quest that began over a decade ago with a chance observation has reached a milestone: the identification of a......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...And an understanding of the underlying science is certainly helpful in reporting the "something smells fishy" stories as well as the "wow, that's neat" stories. I maintain that one person can and may do both types of science reporting, so it doesn't make sense to separate "investigative journalism" from "science journalism."...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting comments there as well....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Tobis wrote three relevant posts related to this question on 'Only In It For The Gold' recently: &lt;a href="http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2010/03/long-strange-trip.html" title=""&gt;Long Strange Trip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...Science journalism in the future will mostly be conducted by scientists....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Tobis again: &lt;a href="http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2010/03/daniel-sarewitz-is-wrong.html" title=""&gt;Does Science Even Matter?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My position is first, that science can no longer depend on the press, or the institutional press office, or pop science media to get important messages out. That much has become blazingly obvious. Second, that certain messages of science are necessary to sound governance, that science is a crucial component of collective decision making in modern society. As a conclusion, it is necessary for science as a culture to participate directly in public communication. It may not be possible for science as an institution to do so. Consequently science as a culture may need to create new institutions and certainly new career paths to more effectively participate in consequential public discourse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Tobis yet again: &lt;a href="http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2010/03/loose-cannon-in-press-office.html" title=""&gt;Loose Cannon in the Press Office?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If there are temptations about to misrepresent science, it is the responsibility of scientists to stop them. Looking at the matter from the point of view of the young career-seeker, apparently there are two career paths for "science writers"; one being science journalism and the other being the "PIO" or "Press Information Officer" for a scientific research institution. The failures of the first have been crucial to our recent problems, but we should spare a moment to consider the second group.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we can answer questions 'is A or B journalism' only if we agree on the definition of journalism. So, Mike Orcutt at 'Meta-Morph It', asks us to help define it: &lt;a href="http://meta-morphit.blogspot.com/2010/03/explanation.html" title=""&gt;Explanation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we have a discussion about the journalism's role before we discuss what journalism -- either in general or specifically within the context of science communication -- is? A conversation between a scientist and journalist, about the journalist's role in the communication of science, can be productive only if the interested parties work together to determine a mutually-held definition of the term in question.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Paul Raeburn at KSJT thinks that support for Charlotte Observer&amp;#39;s and Raleigh News&amp;amp;Observer&amp;#39;s science pages by Duke Energy is fishy: &lt;a href="http://ksjtracker.mit.edu/2010/03/15/npr-like-funding-for-newspaper-science-section/" title=""&gt;Questioning 'NPR-like' funding for newspaper science section&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thames said he began a search for "someone in the local community" who would underwrite a science section. That helpful community resident turned out to be Duke Energy, one of the largest energy companies in the nation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strange! Newspapers have been lamenting that advertisers, their only source of income, have been leaving them in droves thus precipitating lay-offs and bankruptcies across the industry. And now that one of them decides to come back and throw some pennies, that's a problem? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, let me try an analogy. This is like if my rich Uncle Joe was the only one giving me start-up money for my new business. Let's say it's a family newspaper. He writes me a nice, big check that can cover a year's effort, and in return he wants me to place his ads in it for free. Uncle Joe is an interesting fella, like any family will have. He can be nice and generous. And then he can say something awful. Or he keeps voting for that other, wrong, party every election day....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, funded for the year, I get started with my newspaper. Then, one day, I say something mean about Uncle Joe in my newspaper. He probably does not read it. If he does, he probably looks down at it and laughs, but thinks it is his duty as a rich member of the family to help out nieces and nephews get on their feet and become independent.  If he goes mad, that is just bad business sense on his part - he cannot get his money back (that was the deal, signed by both) and if he says/does something nasty, he just gets slammed harder in the next issue. To which rich Aunt Matilda responds, with glee (she hates Uncle Joe), by promising money for my 2nd year in business ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duke Energy is local. It is like a funky rich Uncle around here. The first one to ask for money. If that does not work, there are other rich uncles around....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2010/03/what_is_journalism_and_do_pios.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/TuXNfP_EOR8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268695229055"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/?p=2521">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/484d0820b11ce9a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Writing Elsewhere"/><title type="html">The Enduring Mystery of Thalidomide</title><published>2010-03-15T23:20:05Z</published><updated>2010-03-15T23:20:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Loom/~3/4QeERm08kS0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2010/03/15/the-enduring-mystery-of-thalidomide/"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="thalidomide" src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2010/03/thalidomide.png" alt="thalidomide" width="440" height="539"&gt;In tomorrow’s New York Times I write about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16limb.html?ref=science&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;the afterlife of the greatest medical disaster in history&lt;/a&gt;. Thalidomide, a drug women took for morning sickness in the late 1950s, caused thousands of devastating birth defects, such as the failure of limbs to develop. Even after the drug was banned, scientists had no idea how it interfered with growing arms and legs. In fact, fifty years later, they’re only just starting to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a particularly interesting story to write coming after &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/science/07limb.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;a piece I wrote for the Times last year&lt;/a&gt; about normal limb development.  Now thalidomide is revealing a new player in the limb development game, a protein that no one knew about when I wrote my 2009 article. In science, very often the only way to understand how something works is  to see what happens when it goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

Originally defined as a temperature greater than 38.3°C (101°F) on several occasions for more than three weeks with no diagnosis after one week of inpatient study, the definition has shifted.  This reflects the dramatic increase in the sophistication of outpatient work ups in the fifty or so years since the term was formally defined. About a third of cases turn out to be infection, another third cancer, a smaller percentage so-called collagen vascular diseases such as lupus.  A significant percentage go undiagnosed.  The work up can be time-consuming and difficult, and various consultants are often called in.  In a modern twist,&lt;a href="http://thezupdate.tumblr.com/"&gt; a Chicago man has asked "the internet" to help with his own FUO work up&lt;/a&gt; (h/t reader HP).  It is just the sort of puzzle internists love, and it looks like he and his significant other have been getting a lot of input.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have nothing to add to the work up at this point, although it's interesting.  What has me thinking is the potential pitfalls, ethical and otherwise, of crowd-sourcing one's medical care. The problems can be divided into two broad categories: those centered on the patient, and those centered on health care professionals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The patient&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowd-sourcing clearly has some potential benefits for the patient, especially those with unusual illnesses and limited access to tertiary care centers.  Seeking out a formal second or third opinion  might be financially or geographically impossible.  There are plenty of medical folks to tap into on line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also plenty of non-medical and pseudo-medical folks who will by happy to take a muddled clinical picture and toss it into the Cuisinart-of-woo for their own purposes.  Separating useful advice from plausible-sounding crapitude is hard work and can provide distraction from seeking real medical care.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the issue of privacy.  If a patient provides enough data to be useful, they have basically outed themselves.  Finding someone's identity become trivial when you know important facts like age, ethnicity, location, and medical problem.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The provider&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been much written on the provision of care at a distance.  In addition to some of the pitfalls of giving "informal" opinions to complete strangers with little of the usual give and take, if we participate, we are encouraging a patient to give out significant protected health information.  While this is unlikely to be a HIPAA violation, I do worry about participating in this type of exercise with a potentially desperate and vulnerable patient who may not, while in crisis, care much about the implications and risks of publishing private health details online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't to say that I'm not fascinated by this case.  I'm following it, thinking about it, and briefly thought about tossing in some opinions.  But this is territory full of unsure footing and hidden pitfalls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/Yvw_c2-EKDU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268692185230"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7879767.post-803904969876339787">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82a42bbee1cdd46a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="The 48 Laws of Power" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The 48 Laws of Power</title><published>2010-03-15T20:23:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-15T20:23:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://amr2you.blogspot.com/2010/03/48-laws-of-power.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://amr2you.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div style="clear:both;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theagencygroup.com/artistphotos/RobertGreene.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="203" rel="nofollow" src="http://www.theagencygroup.com/artistphotos/RobertGreene.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;Power is rooted in our DNA according to Robert Greene, author of &amp;quot;The 48 Laws of Power&amp;quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;"We want to believe we're descended from angels when we're descended from primates, this is part of our nature and there's nothing to be ashamed of." - Green added.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;Greene says the struggle for power affects even the most benign human relationships.

&lt;p&gt;First,&lt;a href="http://negotiationisover.com/2010/03/14/ucla-pro-test-action-alert-mail-a-letter-to-darios-neighbors-today"&gt; the terrorists are still targeting&lt;/a&gt; researcher Dario Ringach. Ringach, a former primate researcher, left the field due to violent pressure from these assholes.  He's done.  He is a &lt;em&gt;former&lt;/em&gt; primate researcher.  But for these goatfuckers, it has never been about helping animals but hurting people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/2010-03-11/news/dogfighting-buts-whimpers-out/"&gt;The Houston Press is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that those charged with participating in a large dogfighting ring in Texas served little or no time.  As far as I can discover, none has received as much as a nasty postcard. (Nor am I suggesting they be harassed.  The courts have spoken.  If you're pissed, write your representative.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the animal rights anencephaly squad are spending their resources and hate on ex-researchers, people who used animals under close scrutiny and regulation for the betterment of humanity, instead of going after people who torture animals for pleasure and monetary gain.  What a bunch of fucking idiots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/LTB9aHYV47U" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268690570698"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/now_thats_what_atheists_look_l.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4aa2bdfd18604158</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Now that's what atheists look like</title><published>2010-03-15T22:02:25Z</published><updated>2010-03-15T22:02:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/w2sX31chNog/now_thats_what_atheists_look_l.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/03/now_thats_what_atheists_look_l.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/behemoth.jpeg" width="250" height="300" alt="behemoth.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have something in common with these guys. That's the Polish death metal band Behemoth, and you can see that they look like &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; atheists: cadaverous, lots of black leather and spikes, with nice metal jewelry in odd places on their clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, none of that is at all like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here they are in performance. I rather like it, but be warned: it's loud and harsh. See if you can spot the resemblance now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Nrvv0HRKgqg%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den_US%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I'll explain, since I guess it isn' quite so obvious. At the beginning of that clip, the lead singer, Nergal, is tearing up a Bible and throwing the pages out to the audience. Hey, I've done that in some of my talks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remind me, though, never to do that in Poland. Poland has a law on the books making it a crime to insult the Roman Catholic Church. &lt;a href="http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=53826"&gt;Offend a Catholic priest, and they can throw you in jail for &lt;i&gt;two years&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; It's an even vaguer version of a blasphemy law, and it's actually being used to silence a marginal and slightly weird critic of the church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, sure, Nergal looks scary and fits a certain stereotype. But he's nowhere near as horrifying as this fellow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2010/03/now_thats_what_atheists_look_l/marcial.jpeg" width="300" height="414" alt="marcial.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;a href="http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/secretive-catholic-order-founded-by-accused-pedophile-under-fire/19398262"&gt;Marcial Maciel&lt;/a&gt;, good buddy to Pope John Paul II and Pope Ratzi, leader of an obscenely rich conservative organization called the Legion of Christ, serial pedophile, and vile monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/tHyhdaTQCS4%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nergal has been charged with insulting the Catholic church and faces a trial that could put him away in jail for a few years. If he dodges that, or when he gets out, I think he should change his act for safety's sake. Instead of dressing like a refugee from hell and tearing up Bibles, he ought to put on a priest's cassock and clerical collar and rape a child on stage. Not only would it be more frightening, but it's behavior the Church does not find offensive.

Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/images/3_h7915_phobos_nadir_H.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2010/03/ME_phobos.jpg" alt="ME_phobos" title="ME_phobos" width="610" height="1140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yegads. Click to embiggen, and see this in all its glory. This image, taken by the Mars Express spacecraft, has a resolution of 4.4 meters per pixel, meaning objects about the size of a two-car garage can be seen on the surface of Phobos. For comparison, this lumpy, battered moon (named for the Greek word for &lt;em&gt;fear&lt;/em&gt;, a companion to Mars) is 27×22x19 kilometers (16×13x11 miles), so even though it’s on the tiny side, this is still a fantastic map of the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And an important one as well: next year, Russia will be launching a probe called &lt;a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/phobos_grunt.html"&gt;Phobos-Grunt&lt;/a&gt; (Phobos soil) that will attempt to land on the moon, collect a sample of its surface, and send it back to Earth! These images of Phobos will help the Russians figure out the best place to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ESA page linked above, you’ll also find a cool 3D anaglyph of Phobos, and if you want to stay up to date on all this, check out &lt;a href="http://webservices.esa.int/blog/blog/7"&gt;the Mars Express blog&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

He places a lot of blame at the door of to-be-Pope Joseph Ratzinger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very much more serious is the role of Joseph Ratzinger, before the  church decided to make him supreme leader, in obstructing justice on a  global scale. After his promotion to cardinal, he was put in charge of  the so-called “Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith” (formerly  known as the Inquisition). In 2001, Pope John Paul II placed this  department in charge of the investigation of child rape and torture by  Catholic priests. In May of that year, Ratzinger issued a confidential  letter to every bishop. In it, he reminded them of the extreme gravity  of a certain crime. &lt;em&gt;But that crime was the reporting of the rape and  torture.&lt;/em&gt; The accusations, intoned Ratzinger, were only treatable  within the church’s own exclusive jurisdiction. Any sharing of the  evidence with legal authorities or the press was utterly forbidden.  Charges were to be investigated “in the most secretive way …  restrained by a perpetual silence … and everyone … is to observe the  strictest secret which is commonly regarded as a secret of the Holy  Office … &lt;em&gt;under the penalty of excommunication&lt;/em&gt;.” (My italics).  Nobody has yet been excommunicated for the rape and torture of children,  but exposing the offense could get you into serious trouble. And this  is the church that warns us against moral relativism! (See, for more on  this appalling document, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/24/children.childprotection1"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/24/children.childprotection"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; in the London &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; of April  24, 2005, by Jamie Doward.) . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . The Roman Catholic Church is headed by a mediocre Bavarian bureaucrat  once tasked with the concealment of the foulest iniquity, whose  ineptitude in that job now shows him to us as a man personally and  professionally responsible for enabling a filthy wave of crime.  Ratzinger himself may be banal, but his whole career has the stench of  evil—a clinging and systematic evil that is beyond the power of exorcism  to dispel. What is needed is not medieval incantation but the  application of justice—and speedily at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can blame be laid, too, at the door of religion?  I think so.  After all, these crimes are due to a combination of faith-based moral sanctity, inspiring parents to turn their children over to priests for guidance and education, and the twisted Church policies of celibacy and sexual repressiveness, which undoubtedly promoted sexual predation.  Sure, members of other institutions have engaged in child abuse, and sometimes the abusers have been protected, but never on this scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faitheists often cite Catholicism as one of those “benign” faiths.  The sickening conspiracy of silence promoted by Church officials doesn’t look so benign to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  Father Peter Hullerman, whom Ratzinger reassigned to a new parish after he was convicted by a German court for child abuse (see Hitchens’s piece), &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/world/europe/16church.html?hp"&gt;has just been suspended&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The light, they say, is very bright, lasts for a couple of hours, stays near the horizon, changes colors, and keeps coming back to the same spot night after night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Bthocaqf0"&gt;Here’s an MSNBC report about it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/X5Bthocaqf0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26hd%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be an alien visitor from another world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I don’t think so. In fact, I think it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; another world. Venus, to be specific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Fort Wayne, Indiana website &lt;a href="http://www.wane.com/dpps/news/strange/ufo-sighting-caught-on-tape-in-ohio-jgr_3263531"&gt;has an interview with one of the witnesses on video, and includes some still shots&lt;/a&gt;. Everything in his description, including the photographs, makes me think he and the others are seeing Venus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Venus can be seen in the west — the direction to Lake Erie and Cleveland as seen in Euclid —  shining brightly just after sunset. It is so bright it can be seen while the sky is still light (I’ve seen Venus in the middle of the day). It appears to hover. Changing atmospheric conditions can affect its color, especially when it’s low to the horizon. It can be seen night after night, in the same spot in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying what these people are seeing is in fact Venus, but it sure fits everything I’ve heard in the news reports (sometimes the witnesses describe multiple lights, but when looking to the horizon, especially over a big city, it’s not too unlikely to see planes flying around). In the MSNBC report they talked to the FAA, the military, and others (including a UFO guy from England), but never talked to an astronomer. Hmmph. And note that in these news articles, Venus is never mentioned! That’s mighty peculiar, given how spectacular it is in the west after sunset. It’s really hard to miss. A likely explanation is that it’s not mentioned because it is, in fact, the culprit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting a kick out of just how positive so many people are that this is a flying saucer of some kind. I wonder how many of these folks actually are familiar with the night sky, and would recognize Venus when they see it? &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/21/slamming-the-astronomers-should-see-ufos-myth/"&gt;That’s why I think&lt;/a&gt; very few astronomers (pro or amateur) report UFOs: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/25/aliens-yes-ufos-no/"&gt;astronomers tend to know what they’re looking at in the sky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you hear a report like this, don’t jump to the conclusion that some interplanetary object is making a close encounter… because it may very well be interplanetary, but the encounter may not be terribly close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huang Youyi, chairman of the International Federation of Translators,  makes this alarming prediction: "If we do not pay attention and we do  not take measures to stop Chinese mingling with English, Chinese will no  longer be a pure language in a couple of years." He goes on to state,  "In the long run, Chinese will lose its role as an independent language  for communicating information and expressing human feelings."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To ensure that such a horrible fate does not become a reality, Mr. Huang  brought forward stern recommendations before the Chinese People&amp;#39;s  Political Consultative Conference that was held recently in Beijing. Mr.  Huang&amp;#39;s proposals would ban publications from using English names,  places, people, and companies. Aside from the fact that this would put a  large crimp in the global aspirations and operations of China Inc.,  embarking on the long, slippery slope of language purification — if  carried out as energetically and thoroughly as the typical  politco-cultural movements of the past 60 years — the Chinese language,  quite the opposite of being purified, would end up being seriously  impoverished. No longer would the Chinese be permitted to speak of  &amp;quot;lion&amp;quot; dances, &amp;quot;honey&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;honeymoons,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;coral,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;magi / shamans,&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;sachima,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;biology,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;religion,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;philosophy,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;economics,&amp;quot; and  &amp;quot;republics&amp;quot; (such as their own people&amp;#39;s republic!), &amp;quot;military affairs,&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;journalists,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;factories,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;workshops,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;science,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;physics,&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;literature,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;utopias,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;centuries,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;X-rays,&amp;quot;&amp;quot;laser,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;computers,&amp;quot; and  countless other terms that form the backbone of everyday discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what really worries Mr. Huang is when foreign words are  represented in a foreign script. But there's an easy way around that:  simply transcribe the offending terms in Chinese script. Here's a good  example of how that could be done:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Chinification.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;欢迎光临&lt;br&gt;

wéiěrkàngmǔtūàowōsīdào&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"welcome to our store!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I know &lt;a href="http://www.fit-ift.org/en/cv_huang_youyi.php"&gt;Mr. Huang&lt;/a&gt; personally. He prides himself on his  English and was, in fact, an English major when he went to university.  Mr. Huang was my brother Denis' boss at Foreign Language Press back in  the 80s. His entire professional career has been intimately involved  with the study, teaching, and translation of English and other foreign  languages.   Since Mr. Huang has been enormously effective in his chosen profession  of Sino-English translation, he should not be surprised at the inroads  of English in China and in Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's what Casey Luskin just posted over on &lt;i&gt;Evoluton News &amp;amp; Views&lt;/i&gt; (sic) [&lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2010/03/a_response_to_questions_from_a.html"&gt;A Response to Questions from a Biology Teacher: How Do We Test Intelligent Design?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Regarding testability, ID makes the following testable predictions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Natural structures will be found that contain many parts arranged in intricate patterns that perform a specific function (e.g. complex and specified information).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Such natural structures exist. They are perfectly compatible with evolution. This prediction does not distinguish between Intelligent Design Creationism and real science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;(2) Forms containing large amounts of novel information will appear in the fossil record suddenly and without similar precursors.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The vast majority of of species with novel information have arisen gradually with plenty of transitional fossils to document their evolution. In a small number of cases (e.g. Cambrian Explosion) the evidence for evolution from known precursors is too sophisticated for creationists to follow. This prediction is not supported; therefore, Intelligent Design Creationism is falsified for all species where we have lots of data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;(3) Convergence will occur routinely. That is, genes and other functional parts will be re-used in different and unrelated organisms.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Convergence is perfectly consistent with evolution. This prediction is meaningless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;(4) Much so-called “junk DNA” will turn out to perform valuable functions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Most of our genome is junk. The evidence for this is overwhelming. Intelligent Design Creationism has been falsified. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;In this regard, ID is falsifiable. When we test these predictions, ID passes those tests.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;No it doesn't. Two of the "tests" are consistent with evolution so the "test" is meaningless. Intelligent Design Creationism fails the other two tests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr width="200"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/37148773-487036100033164138?l=sandwalk.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Larry Moran)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268680822176"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=29505">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ef5031e61ddb914</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="psychology"/><title type="html">Crazy in the U.S.A.</title><published>2010-03-15T19:00:43Z</published><updated>2010-03-15T19:00:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/crazy-in-the-u-s-a/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The Daily Beast ranked America's "craziest" cities by psychiatrists per capita, stress, eccentricity, and drinking.</summary><author><name>By FREAKONOMICS</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1268680286453"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/while_im_crashing_polls.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d7fdb9849e63907d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">While I'm crashing polls...</title><published>2010-03-15T20:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-03-15T20:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/TYnZkCASovk/while_im_crashing_polls.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/while_im_crashing_polls.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I'm &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/do_you_believe_autism_and_vaccines_are_l.php"&gt;crashing idiotic Internet polls&lt;/a&gt;, I might as well see if I can send some tactical air support over to Steve Salzberg, who wrote an excellent blog post about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2010/03/2010_another_bad_year_for_the_anti-vacci.php"&gt;Autism Omnibus ruling that I just wrote about&lt;/a&gt; earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;

Re : Full Funding IDEA Part B ( S 1652 &lt;a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN01652:" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:SN01652:&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dear Senator ........... :&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As your constituent [and a parent of a [ age ] year old Special Education Student], I urge you to do everything within your power to support Full Funding IDEA Part B ( S 1652 ).&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reaches every public school. Approximately 12 percent of public school students receive assistance through special education. These children deserve special attention and additional resources.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
35 years ago, when IDEA was passed (1975) the law included a commitment to pay 40 percent of the average per-student cost for every special education student. That commitment has never been met.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
School districts are being forced to redirect more and more dollars from their general education budget to cover the federal shortfall, which hurts all students — those in general education and those in special education. Since 1975, the unfunded federal portion has cost local schools and taxpayers more than $300 billion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your support.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Your name&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://sciencedigestive.blogspot.com/2010/03/dear-chiropractors-from-science-no-14.html"&gt;Science has written a letter to Chiropractic&lt;/a&gt; (#14). Here are a few choice bits.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, Chiroprology, it’s come to this. Me writing you a bloody letter, like some sort of 18th century scribe, just so you’ll have what I’m telling you in a visible format to double check for hidden meaning and all that. I’m the anthropomorphic personification of Science, I don’t have time to write pointless sarcastic missives to my detractors (and yes, I realise that plenty of evidence to the contrary can be found on this blog, but since when is evidence important, right?)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Basically, this is your last warning. Cut your crap and know your place, or you’ll get to see what I do when I’m REALLY angry.
&lt;/p&gt;
......

&lt;p&gt;
So listen, Chiroproctor and Gamble, we both know, as does Simon, that what you claim to be able to do is bogus. Yes, that’s right, I dropped the B-bomb! What you going to do? Sue me? You genuinely think you can sue an abstract concept? Admittedly, it’s only marginally more absurd than thinking you can cure bedwetting with a back-rub, but either way it won’t work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What is it about the word ‘bogus’ that bothers you so much, anyway? Do you thing, we’re using some offensive acronym? Chiropractors are bogus (Blatantly useless guff, obviously stupid?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether it's a sham test or a myth it doesn't matter. Why should any intelligent person base his faith on ancient myths?

&lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago I moved from Washington, DC to Columbus, Ohio to become the new Communications Director for the &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;!  It’s been a hectic couple of months as I had to find an apartment, move, and start work.  The job is great, and I joined just in time to drive back to DC to participate in the historic White House briefing visit.  Everything has been happening so fast; I feel like I’m just now getting my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of moving has been leaving people.  I’m remarkably bad at keeping in touch with people, so I worry about what will happen.  I had to say goodbye to my girlfriend, parents, roommates, and friends.  It wasn’t easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s made the process easier was the thriving atheist community here in Columbus.  The Secular Student Alliance shares an office with &lt;a href="http://camp-quest.org"&gt;Camp Quest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.hcco.org/"&gt;Humanist Community of Central Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and we all spend a good amount of time together outside of work.  I’ve been to Central Ohioans for Rational Inquiry’s “Drinking Skeptically” night, a drinking event with Omnipresent Atheists, and meetings of OSU’s Students For Freethought (we went drinking afterward).  If I hadn’t learned long ago to pace myself, my liver would be threatening legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to be an introvert who takes a while to warm up in social settings.  But I felt welcome and comfortable walking into these groups, introducing myself, and joining them.  It put me at ease to know that the people I was meeting would likely share my values and accept me for who I am.  A thought struck me: This must be what it feels like to have community through church.  Now we atheists are providing it for each other.  It makes me proud of our movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to isolate myself in the atheist world – I have other interests.  So far, I found a group of students who play pickup games of roller hockey and I’m looking into the Columbus Area Boardgaming Society.  But having the atheist/skeptical/humanist community here has really made me worry less about fitting in and meeting people here in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my story isn’t unique.  We’ve heard countless similar stories from people who were thrilled to find group in their area for the first time.  I’ve just never experienced it so personally, and it gave me an appreciation for what we’re doing.  Keep up the good work, people!&lt;/p&gt;

Now, it appears, brown is green. Following the total confusion over the retraction of a paper on &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2010/03/ippc-sealevel-gate/"&gt;sea level&lt;/a&gt;, claims of another “mistake” by the IPCC are making the rounds of the blogosphere. This time, the issue is the impact of rainfall changes on the Amazon rainforest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in 2007 showed that the forest gets greener when it rains less. A new study, by &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2009GL042154.shtml"&gt;Samanta et al. in Geophysical Research Letters&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that the earlier work was flawed. Aided by an apparently rather careless press release, this is being used as evidence that the Amazon is less sensitive to rainfall changes than the IPCC claimed. But the Samanta et al. paper actually does not address the central questions at all. It only addresses whether a single anomalous rainfall year had an impact that is measureable and interpretable from a satellite sensor. The conclusion is that they could not detect a change. As noted in a commentary from Simon Lewis, University of Leeds, “the critical question is how these forests respond to repeated droughts, not merely single-year droughts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis – a broadly published expert on tropical forests – makes a number of additional important points in his commentary below. Bottom line: IPCC gets it right as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—————&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Guest Commentary by Simon Lewis, University of Leeds, UK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2010/2009GL042154.shtml"&gt;Samanta et al.&lt;/a&gt; study uses sensors on satellites to assess the colour of the rainforest canopy in the dry season of the year 2005, compared to the dry seasons of the years 2003 and 2004. More detected green colour in 2005 may suggest that the forest is being more productive (more green leaves photosynthesising), or more brown colours may suggest leaves dying and less productivity, than the previous years. The results show that 2005 was little different to the previous years, despite the strong drought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important new information, as in 2007, a paper using broadly the same satellite-based method showed a strong ‘greening-up’ of the Amazon in 2005, suggesting tolerance to drought (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5850/612"&gt;Saleska et al. 2007, &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new study shows that those results were not reproducible, but also highlight the extreme caution that should be attached to satellite studies generally in this field, with instruments in space collecting data which is then used to infer subtle changes in the ecology of tropical forests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the 2007 paper, Oliver Phillips, myself, and others, published &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5919/1344"&gt;a paper in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, using ground observations from across the Amazon, showing that while the 2005 drought did not dramatically change the growth of the trees compared to a normal year, as Samanta et al. also show, the deaths of trees did increase considerably.  The new study of Samanta et al. does not contradict the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5919/1344"&gt;Phillips et al. study&lt;/a&gt;, which itself shows the Amazon is vulnerable to drought via impacts on tree mortality.  The Phillips et al. paper showed that remaining Amazon forest trees changed  from absorbing nearly 2 billion tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere annually over recent decades, as tree growth has been exceeding mortality, to being a large, but temporary, source of over 3 billion tonnes, from the elevated tree mortality associated with the 2005 drought event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence for the possibility of a major die-back of the Amazon rainforest is due to two factors,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. That climate change induced decreases in rainfall in the dry season occur, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The trees cannot tolerate these reductions in rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Samanta paper does not directly address the first point; this is addressed using global circulation models (of which some, but not all, show a strong drying trend for the east of the Amazon over the 21st century). The second point is only addressed in a limited way. The critical question is how these forests respond to repeated droughts, not merely single-year droughts. The forests are of course able to withstand these single droughts (otherwise there would be no rainforest!) — it is their ability to survive an increased frequency of the most severe droughts that is critical to answer. Drought experiments, where a roof is built under the forest canopy to reduce rainfall, show that most forest trees survive a single year’s intense drought, in agreement with the ground observations in the 2005 drought, but can’t persist with repeated years of drought. The Samanta study does not address this point at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the new Samanta et al. study lends further weight to the emerging picture of the impact of the 2005 drought: that tree growth was relatively unaffected, but tree mortality increased, contributing temporarily to accelerating the rate of climate change, rather than as usual reducing it, via additions of carbon to the atmosphere from the dead trees. The mortality was far from catastrophic, but the impact on the carbon cycle was globally significant. This is hardly the ‘no impact’ of the 2005-drought on the forest suggested in various news reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should add that there is considerable uncertainty associated with the models suggesting decreases in rainfall, and uncertainty as to how Amazon forests may react (especially when one considers the impacts of deforestation, logging, and fire combined with climate change impacts). But this uncertainty is being chipped away at by scientists, a task in which the Samanta et al. paper assists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, the Boston University press release to accompany the paper was titled, “New study debunks myths about Amazon rain forests”. The opening line runs: “A new NASA-funded study has concluded that Amazon rain forests were remarkably unaffected in the face of once-in-a-century drought in 2005, neither dying nor thriving, contrary to a previously published report and claims by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.”  So, have scientists, myself included, been peddling myths? Have respected journals being publishing them? Have the IPCC? The answer is no, no and no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the IPCC have largely ignored the papers on the model results of decreasing rainfall in the east of the Amazon, and the diverse evidence used to assess the sensitivity of these forests to such rainfall reductions. There are a couple of lines in IPCC Working Group I (“New coupled climate-carbon models (Betts et al., 2004; Huntingford et al., 2004) demonstrate the possibility of large feedbacks between future climate change and vegetation change, discussed further in Section 7.3.5 (i.e., a die back of Amazon vegetation and reductions in Amazon precipitation).”). And in Working Group II there is a now infamous single sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Up to 40% of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation; this means that the tropical vegetation, hydrology and climate system in South America could change very rapidly to another steady state, not necessarily producing gradual changes between the current and the future situation (Rowell and Moore, 2000).” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement is not as carefully worded as it should be, and incorrectly referenced, but basically scientifically correct and defensible with recourse to the peer-reviewed literature available at the time. Rainforest persists above a threshold of rainfall, below which one finds savanna. If this threshold is crossed a landscape dominated by rainforest can ‘flip’ to savanna. Therefore a ’slight’ reduction can lead to a ‘dramatic’ reaction. Of course, evidence of a shift to a new lower rainfall climate regime is needed, and evidence of large areas of forest close to that rainfall threshold would be required for the IPCC statement to be reasonable; there is ample published evidence for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the conclusions in the IPCC 2007 Fourth Assessment Report are strengthened (because the anomalous result of the Saleska et al. 2007 paper appear to be at fault), not weakened, by the new Samanta et al. study as their press release implies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update: Saleska responds, pointing out that a) their 2007 paper is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; contradicted by Samanta et al. (2010); b) nor is the IPCC report weakened by either paper.
