&lt;p&gt;Thats the title of an article by Marty D. Omoto of the &lt;a href="http://www.cdcan.us/"&gt;California Disability Community Action Network&lt;/a&gt;. Omoto is writing about the protracted efforts to &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/us/20california.html&amp;amp;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hp&amp;amp;OP=6144ba6eQ2FsEa3su5p-n55!@s@rr4sr@s@rsk-s@rp1B_q5nQ7C_1.m!JB"&gt;pass the state budget&lt;/a&gt;. As yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/us/20california.html&amp;amp;OQ=_rQ3D1Q26hp&amp;amp;OP=6144ba6eQ2FsEa3su5p-n55!@s@rr4sr@s@rsk-s@rp1B_q5nQ7C_1.m!JB"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; noted, billions will be cut the budgets of California schools, healthcare institutions and entitlement programs. In his article, Omoto writes that California's Department of Developmental Services is seeking to cut some $100 million, with an additional 7.1% cut to regional center provider payments beginning September 1, 2009. Such cuts are nothing new: Going back to 2001 and into the 1990s, "cuts were made not only to developmental services- but to many other services and programs impacting people with disabilities, mental health needs and seniors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not, Amoto writes, that there should be "'no cuts'" to services and programs for these three constituencies It's that there should be "'no more cuts'":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if the budget language didn't make that clear, it should be clear to us as good advocates that our advocacy demands that we bring up and sometimes force attention and consideration of different public policy ideas that the State may not have considered, may not want addressed or may not want to focus on. They have their job - and there are tremendously good and decent people working in the Department of Developmental Services. But we have our job too. And we should do our job as advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should not as advocates allow any report or document to somehow control our commitment to rights or limit our vision for the future or diminishing our hopes for the people we love. That's not being unrealistic or avoiding a hard choice - it recognizes reality and the limited choices we often face. I know that from personal experience, as I know so many families and people do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;It should be clear to us as good advocates that our advocacy demands that we bring up and sometimes force attention and consideration of different public policy ideas that the State may not have considered, may not want addressed or may not want to focus on.&lt;/em&gt;"  Being a "good advocate" means calling the powers that be to consider ideas and issues that they "may not want addressed or may not want to focus on"----it's about seeing where following established ways of doing and thinking is not only limited, but ineffectual and even contrary to what actual individuals actually need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocacy, according to Omoto, is in part a visionary enterprise. It's about imagining a world where the things that hold individuals with disabilities back are missing. It's a reminder that advocacy involves something more than "raising money for research" or simply "helping other people": These have their place, but making a real and concrete difference in the world and in someone's life---by working to end the use of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_3_against_physical_restraints_amp_padded_rooms"&gt;restraints and seclusion&lt;/a&gt; and taking a stand (and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stopping_child_abuse_too_political_for_autism_speaks"&gt;being political&lt;/a&gt;) about issues like discrimination, students' rights, human rights. As Omoto writes at the end of his article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if we always remember that every life matters, than we will remember that we are talking about lives, about values and about rights - and not just about savings and a budget line item&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights, values, and lives----those are something more than worthy to advocate for.&lt;/p&gt;

No, this article isn't a plug for our store. Instead, I'd like to foster comment on an issue that I've found major disagreement on in the skeptical community. And that is: is it ethical to charge $99.99 for something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the answer is yes. You can charge whatever you want for your products. But consider the impact of $99.99 versus the $100.00. Even though there's a difference of only one cent, or 1/10,000th of the original price, studies show that more people will buy at $99.99 than at $100.00. The second figure &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gasoline in the US, this manipulation is carried to the impossible level of 10ths of a cent. I paid $1.799 for a gallon of gas today, which rang up as $1.80 as it's impossible to pay fractions of cents in this country and the amount is rounded up. The 9/10ths of a cent is there only to make the price look lower than it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the 1¢ is probably not the breaking point in a financial decision, what is? It seems obvious that it's psychology, and that people aren't really thinking about the price so much as having emotion about it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235112159103"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/20/space-junk-1-science-0/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d8ee8eab5210aa2c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Space"/><category term="Technology"/><category term="Hubble Space Telescope"/><category term="satellite debris"/><category term="space shuttle"/><title type="html">Space Junk 1: Science 0</title><published>2009-02-20T06:28:43Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T06:28:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/20/space-junk-1-science-0/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember when that defunct Russian satellite crashed into the Iridium satellite a week or so ago?  Lots of debris, some of which came down as &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/16/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-satellite/"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not all the debris came down.  Most was left in orbit, and apparently has already had some effect on other satellites, as people had feared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And worse for astronomers, Nature (&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090217/full/457940a.html"&gt;subscription only&lt;/a&gt;) is now reporting that with the increased debris, the risk to the Space Shuttle and its crew may now have been pushed up to a level that precludes the upcoming servicing mission (SM4, currently scheduled for May).   NASA is currently evaluating the situation, and we should all know more in a few weeks.  But, if the servicing mission is cancelled, it’s going to be a huge blow for astronomers.  (It wouldn’t be as tragic as losing another crew, however, so I completely support what NASA is doing in this case.)  I’m speculating that if the servicing mission is cancelled, there might be an opportunity to try a robotic servicing mission, which would be good practice for learning how to eventually service satellites out at L2. But it seems unlikely that a robotic mission could bring the full complement of COS, WFC3, ACS, and STIC on-line, whereas the SM4 crew would have a good chance of getting them all in, along with other upgrades to the satellite’s systems.&lt;/p&gt;

In each case, those whom the public trusts to make wise decisions have betrayed their ignorance of both pseudomedicine and the realities of governmental regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain why, it will first be necessary to make a few assertions, which are linked to developed arguments where necessary:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Naturopathic Medicine” is a &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/465994"&gt;hodgepodge &lt;/a&gt;of pseudoscientific beliefs and absurd treatments. Its practitioners, including those at the highest levels of the cult, &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=15208545"&gt;misrepresent &lt;/a&gt;what they do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effective self-regulation of a group of health practitioners requires at least 3 prerequisites: first, there must be objective, science-based, externally measurable criteria for standards of practice; second, the group must be large enough so that the regulatory board is able to act in a disinterested fashion; third, there must be adequate resources, eg, funding and cooperation with other pertinent governmental entities, for the board to carry out its charge. Regulatory schemes for tiny groups of sectarian practitioners &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=141"&gt;lack &lt;/a&gt;the first two criteria and cannot sustain the third without financial aid from other sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Putting the onus of such regulation onto a state medical board will not solve the problem, because &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=11061738"&gt;a)&lt;/a&gt; “even the most meticulous regulation of nonsense must still result in nonsense”; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=141#comment-4501"&gt;b)&lt;/a&gt; responsible state medical boards would rather not deal with such nonsense, when the only rational action would be to undermine legislative intent by revoking the licenses of all nonsense-practitioners; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=141#comment-4407"&gt;c)&lt;/a&gt; “A widely accepted rule of medical malpractice states that ‘a physician is entitled to have his treatment of his patient tested by the rules and principles of the school of medicine to which he belongs, and not by those of some other school.’ “ This is especially true if the regulatory language calls for an &lt;a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/Clics/CLICS2009A/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/EED6C188F451AFB38725754700782701?Open&amp;amp;file=1175_01.pdf://"&gt;advisory body&lt;/a&gt; that includes practitioners of the implausible claims in question; and d) even without such an advisory board, some perplexed or cowed medical boards will defer to the opinions of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=272"&gt;quack apologists&lt;/a&gt; or be stymied by recent, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=235"&gt;pro-quackery language &lt;/a&gt;promulgated by the Federation of State Medical Boards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-regulation and the “widely accepted rule” quoted above predict that boards charged with regulating practitioners of implausible methods provide a safe haven for those practitioners to a greater extent than they provide protection for unwary citizens. In the case of “naturopathic medicine,” &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=143"&gt;several examples &lt;/a&gt;support this prediction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even state medical boards, which generally fulfill the criteria in #1 above, do not reliably discipline MDs who promote and use implausible, substandard methods. See &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=214"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=211"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=247"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=235"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=272"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDs claim to be “primary care physicians” or “primary care providers” or “family doctors,” each of which is a &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/minority.pdf"&gt;dangerous ruse&lt;/a&gt;. No amount of legislative crafting at the state level could possibly change these misportrayals, which are ubiquitous on naturopathic websites, including those of the “approved” schools, the &lt;a href="http://www.naturopathic.org/viewbulletin.php?id=29"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.coanp.org/"&gt;Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians&lt;/a&gt;, and almost every “degreed” Colorado ND who has a website—each of whom, therefore, is in violation of Colorado law (for two conspicuous examples, look &lt;a href="http://www.denvernaturopathic.com/docs.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current Director of the Colorado Division of Registrations has &lt;a href="http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2005/09/speakout-state-ignores-naturopaths.html"&gt;refused to prosecute&lt;/a&gt; naturopaths who pose as physicians, in spite of language in the &lt;a href="http://www.dora.state.co.us/medical/Statute.pdf"&gt;Colorado Medical Practice Act&lt;/a&gt; requiring her to do so and in spite of most of the legwork having already been done by Linda Rosa and her husband, Larry Sarner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A conceit of NDs is that their methods are based on science. Their textbook, for example, states that its content is supported by “10,000 citations to peer-reviewed literature providing standards of practice for natural medicine. Based on a solid combination of theory and clinical studies [etc.].” This claim is &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=15208545"&gt;categorically false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NDs are neither &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=146"&gt;ethically &lt;/a&gt;nor &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=151"&gt;scientifically &lt;/a&gt;qualified to prescribe “natural medicines” or to provide counseling about nutrition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/minority.pdf"&gt;no hard evidence&lt;/a&gt; that “educated” NDs are less of a threat to public safety than are more numerous “traditional” naturopaths. It is possible that the opposite is the case, because the latter do not claim to be physicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every other argument for regulating NDs has been previously and thoroughly &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/atwood.html"&gt;debunked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Colorado Dept. of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) has previously &lt;a href="http://www.naturowatch.org/licensure/coloradosunrise05.pdf"&gt;demonstrated its naivete&lt;/a&gt; regarding this issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Colorado, the distinction between “licensure” and “registration” is minor and barely relevant to the public’s perception of a state-endorsed practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at the current events. These will be presented by quoting statements of some of those involved. I have added hyperlinks, emphasis, and, when needed, comments. Please keep the list above in mind as you read this material, although there is little to add to Linda Rosa’s arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Colorado&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2/8/09, Linda Rosa wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Naturopaths are trying for licensure once again — &lt;a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2009a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/EED6C188F451AFB38725754700782701?open&amp;amp;file=1175_01.pdf"&gt;HB1175&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, on scanning, looks much like last year’s, but it additionally (and ridiculously) calls for a 3-year task force to report annually to the legislature “concerning the practice of naturopathic medicine in Colorado” and to sunset in 2014.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most disturbing change is not in the bill itself: organized medicine—for better or worse, usually the last hope for resisting state endorsements of quackery—has finally caved to the pressure. Ms. Rosa expressed her concerns to Diana Protopapa, the Director of Political Affairs and Education at the Colorado Medical Society (CMS):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Ms. Protopapa and CMS Leadership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for speaking with me yesterday about HB1175, the bill that would legitimize naturopathy as a profession in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very disheartening to learn the Colorado Medical Society supports passage of HB1175, though I understand your House of Delegates is strongly opposed to such legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to help clear up some misconceptions and offer reasons why CMS leadership should work to kill this bill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)  You indicate that CMS believes that many Coloradoans are using the services of naturopaths and that is why the state should take steps to protect the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is no evidence supporting this belief. A large NIH (NCCAM) survey in 2007 indicates a very small percentage of the public uses naturopaths (0.2%). That translates to about 10,000 Coloradoans using Naturopaths. Compare that to some 430,000 who use Chiropractic in our state. (Note: Loveland’s McKee hospital closed its alternative medicine center for lack of interest and financial loss.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)  CMS apparently believes that naturopaths offer some valuable services. You mentioned nutrition counseling as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is actually a big problem area. Naturopaths do not use science-based practices, and that includes the area of nutrition. Naturopath nutrition counseling includes dangerous detoxing regimens and expensive, worthless supplements. Naturopaths of all sorts are infamous for recommending highly restrictive, low calorie diets for cancer patients, which can be lethal for this population.  A leading “degreed” naturopath (Bastyr University) recommends the infamous &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=291"&gt;Gerson Therapy&lt;/a&gt;/Diet for cancer patients: it consists of several coffee enemas each day with a diet of juiced vegetables, fruits and raw calf liver. Last year, the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians legislative activities were sponsored by 13 “Big Supplement” companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)  HB1175 would require registered naturopaths to follow public health policy for some children. But naturopaths are “vitalists” who reject germ theory. They are educated to oppose public health policy, such as &lt;a href="http://quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/immu.html"&gt;immunization&lt;/a&gt;, fluoridation, and pasteurization. How does that make them qualified to carry out these policies effectively or reliably?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Please read (below) what a cancer patient who is under the care of a licensed naturopath wrote. All the testing and treatments recommended to this woman are worthless, expensive — and some would likely shorten her life. Note the “treatment” program was determined before the bogus labs were done. The restrictions in HB1175 would do little to prevent such exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Members of the task force required by HB1175 will be picked by a DORA employee with an obvious bias for naturopathy. This same DORA employee, a lawyer, would make all final decisions regarding appropriate care. Requiring evidence-based practices can be gotten around, because alternative medicine practitioners have their own “journals” and their own low standards for “evidence.”&lt;br&gt;
(It is notable that NIH-funded research, which began in 1991, has not validated a single CAM practice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6)  CMS may not have been fully aware of all the nonsense in naturopathy when it helped craft this bill. Attached is a disturbing list of *all the practices* the ‘degreed’ naturopaths in Colorado have offered on their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7)  With HB1175, registered naturopaths would be exempt from the Medical Practice Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;8)  “Degreed” naturopaths also kill, but they don’t go to prison like [Colorado] naturopath Brian O’Connel did for killing&lt;font face="Lucida Grande"&gt; Sean Flanagan:  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="Times"&gt;When&lt;strong&gt; 16-year-old Megan Wilson&lt;/strong&gt; of Kenmore, WA, had a severe asthma attack, her mother took her to her “primary care physician,” Lucinda Messer, a licensed, degreed naturopath.  Megan got some acupuncture, a shot of vitamin B-12, an herbal preparation, and was sent home.  She died.  If Messer had taken her to an emergency room&lt;em&gt; across the street&lt;/em&gt;  from her office, Megan most certainly would have survived.&lt;br&gt;
     While the parents won a wrongful death case against Messer, who is a licensed naturopath in Arizona and Washington, the naturopath boards in both those states cleared her of all charges of incompetence.&lt;br&gt;
(see&lt;/font&gt; &lt;a href="https://phsexchweb.partners.org/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-06-08/news/death-by-natural-causes.php"&gt;&lt;font face="Times"&gt;&lt;u&gt;http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-06-08/news/death-by-natural-causes.php&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font face="Times"&gt; “Death by NATURAL Causes” -&lt;em&gt; Seattle Weekly&lt;/em&gt;, June 8, 2005)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9)  This bill, if it passes, will not be the end of naturopath bills. Naturopaths consider themselves the equivalent of primary care physicians and are now seeking in other states more and more privileges (full prescription, OB/GYN services, minor surgery, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10) Some legislators look to naturopaths to serve poor and rural populations. This would set up an two-tiered healthcare system. CMS would clearly not want to encourage that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implore CMS leadership to reconsider its support of HB1175. First do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A CANCER PATIENT WROTE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this Doctor scared me even more than the first one I went too. Her&lt;br&gt;
nurse asked me, “Are you going to commence the blood test?” I said,&lt;br&gt;
“Sure!” When she shows me how much I must come in with by the next day,&lt;br&gt;
3,253.75 dollars.. I was stunt. I said, “What blood test is that?” She&lt;br&gt;
was adding all the testing with out the treatment program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is all the testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete digestive analysis test  $550.00 (A higher cost than the other&lt;br&gt;
Doctor I saw)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive liver Detox         $260.00&lt;br&gt;
RBC Minerals                            $270.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essential Fatty Acids                 $320.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amino acids                              $480.00&lt;br&gt;
Spectracell 3000                        $420.00&lt;br&gt;
Heavy metal challenge                $385.00&lt;br&gt;
Estronex                                   $180.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 hour hormone/ HGH               $550.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would get a 15% discount if paid all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment program  Which they want to do&lt;br&gt;
MHA $351.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colonic Therapy 10x               $540.00   (can we do this at home?)&lt;br&gt;
Reflorestation 10x                   $225.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergy Elimination 30x           $950.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C IV 10x                    $850.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutritional Consultation 4x      $435.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physician APPTS 5x              $500.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peroxide 8x                            $760.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I wonder, How much of this do I really need and how much is just&lt;br&gt;
excess and adding to my bill?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Protopapa replied to Ms. Rosa:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linda,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to visit with you anytime regarding your concerns on CMS’ support of HB 1175. According to your assertions below, it appears that you misunderstood many of the issues we discussed yesterday and I feel it’s important that we all understand Colorado’s long history with naturopathic regulation legislation and the varied reasons why CMS is supporting  HB 1175. But before I do that, it’s very important that I make the distinction for you that CMS policy opposes&lt;u&gt; licensure&lt;/u&gt; of naturopaths. HB 1175 r&lt;u&gt;egisters&lt;/u&gt; naturopaths. This is the lowest form of regulation. Registration does not allow for a rule making board (like physicians, nurses, chiropractors, etc., have) but ensures that the subjects to be registered meet certain qualifications in order to be registered and gives consumers recourse in the event that they are harmed.&lt;font color="#fe0000"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;CMS’ goal with this legislation is to tightly restrict the scope of practice of naturopathy while creating a process to ensure that consumers have timely recourse to regulatory relief when they have been harmed by naturopaths - something the current system does not provide.&lt;font color="#fe0000"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Legislation regulating the practice of naturopathy has been introduced in Colorado for the past 14 years. It initially bore little credibility and was predictably defeated. As the years progressed the naturopaths’ assertions that regulation was necessary in order to protect the public began to gain ground with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) and in 2005, after several deaths occurred at the hands of an unqualified naturopath, DORA recommended licensure. Three years later the division once again gave the nod for regulation. DORA argued that regulation would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Protect the public from the dangers of unskilled naturopaths and unsound treatment or advice, and;&lt;br&gt;
* Protect the public from reliance on unskilled naturopaths, as well as directing them to proper medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the Colorado Association of Naturopathic Physicians’ (CANP) desire for regulation increased. Their case was strengthened by the support of many respected legislators on both sides of the aisle who agreed with DORA that regulating naturopathy is a consumer protection issue particularly in light of the fact that the Board of Medical Examiners doesn’t have the resources to police this discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMS understands that naturopathy and patient safety may sound like fundamentally incompatible concepts to many physicians. After all, naturopathy is not founded in western science and many of its treatments have not been subjected to rigorous clinical tests to determine their effectiveness. CMS also recognizes that a growing number of consumers turn to naturopathy for the treatment of various ailments. And, equally significant, because the practice of naturopathy isn’t regulated, neither the state nor patients have sufficient recourse in the case of harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, naturopathic regulation legislation resurfaced and CMS got the green light from the Council on Legislation (COL) and its Scope of Practice Subcommittee (SOP) to seek common ground in the name of patient safety. After several months of discussion between organized medicine and CANP and many iterations of draft legislation we crafted a bill that features a very limited scope of practice for naturopathic doctors - one that the physicians of CMS, the Colorado Academy of Family Physicians and the Colorado Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatricians feel is appropriate and will adequately protect those members of the public who choose to seek naturopathic care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HB 1175  will create a regulatory scheme that protects consumers, gives them the ability to report substandard care and file grievances against those who are not qualified to practice naturopathic medicine. It also creates a very narrow scope of services that naturopathic doctors can perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many patient protection provisions, HB 1175 will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Register only those individuals who graduate from a post-graduate, four-year residential academic program recognized by the U.S. Department of Education;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Provide “truth in advertising” protections by prohibiting naturopathic doctors from using the terms MD, DO, medical doctor or physician;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Required naturopathic doctors to provide a host of disclosures aimed at educating consumers on the qualifications of a naturopathic doctor, the differences between a naturopathic doctor and a physician (M.D./D.O.) and those practices that naturopathic doctors are prohibited from performing;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, HB 1175 creates a narrow scope of practice in which naturopathic doctors may practice naturopathy. Indeed there are more prohibitions than allowances. Naturopathic doctors are prohibited from practicing or treating the following:&lt;br&gt;
* Prescribing, dispensing or administering prescription drugs other than vitamin B-12 injectables;&lt;br&gt;
* Performing surgical procedures or the use of laser devices;&lt;br&gt;
* Use of anesthesia other than topical anesthetics;&lt;br&gt;
* Administering ionizing radiation or radioactive substances;&lt;br&gt;
* Practicing obstetrics;&lt;br&gt;
* Recommending the discontinuation of care recommended by any other licensed health care provider;&lt;br&gt;
* Treating cancer;&lt;br&gt;
* Providing chelation therapy;&lt;br&gt;
* Performing colonic irrigations;&lt;br&gt;
* Treating a host of conditions that don’t improve with documented evidence within 25 days without advising the patient to consult a licensed physician; and&lt;br&gt;
* Treating children less than two years of age. When treating children between the ages of two and eight, the naturopathic doctor is statutorily required to follow all public health laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you note below that 1175 will make naturopaths exempt from our MPA. Currently, the CO Board of Medical Examiners is not pursuing any complaints filed against naturopaths for practicing medicine because they do not have the resources to do so. HB 1175 will create a funded regulatory structure that will police naturopaths and will sanction those who are practicing medicine without having a medical degree. Without HB 1175, the BME will continue to be unable to pursue such complaints and patients will remain “in the dark” and vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;br&gt;
Diana Protopapa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the misconceptions in Ms. Protopapa’s note, two are particularly disturbing. First, it is misleading to write that “the Board of Medical Examiners doesn’t have the resources to police this discipline.” The reality is that the Director of the Division of Registrations has, for dubious reasons, &lt;a href="http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2005/09/speakout-state-ignores-naturopaths.html"&gt;refused to allow&lt;/a&gt; the BME to aid in the prosecution of naturopath physician-impersonators, even though the language of the Colorado Medical Practice Act requires the board to do exactly that. If money is the issue, then money should be the remedy—not creating a more expensive bureaucracy that will dupe unwary citizens into believing that NDs and their claims have been validated by government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Director of the Division of Registrations, by the way, is the “DORA employee with an obvious bias for naturopathy” mentioned in Ms. Rosa’s first note to Ms. Protopapa, and was also responsible for the misguided DORA Sunrise Review linked from #12 of my list at the beginning of this post. Who do you suppose will be responsible for disciplining NDs under the proposed legislation? The Director of the Division of Registrations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the “very narrow scope of services” is inaccurate, because there is no formal scope of practice in &lt;a href="http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2009a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/EED6C188F451AFB38725754700782701?open&amp;amp;file=1175_01.pdf"&gt;the bill&lt;/a&gt;. Even the “prohibitions” are subject to change. According to whose advice? According to the advice of the Naturopathic Doctors Task Force, which will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…CONSIST OF THE &lt;strong&gt;DIRECTOR&lt;/strong&gt;; REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT; AND EQUAL NUMBERS OF PHYSICIANS LICENSED UNDER PART 1 OF ARTICLE 36 OF THIS TITLE AND &lt;strong&gt;NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS APPOINTED BY THE DIRECTOR.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else will the Task Force be asked to consider?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(a) WHETHER COLORADO SHOULD ESTABLISH A REGULATORY PROGRAM TO OVERSEE THE PRACTICE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE BY NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) THE QUALIFICATIONS OF NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS AND WHAT SCOPE OF PRACTICE SHOULD GOVERN NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE IN COLORADO;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(c) WHETHER NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND, IF SO, UNDER WHAT FORMULARY AND HOW SUCH FORMULARY IS TO BE DETERMINED;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) WHETHER SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS OF NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS AND, IF SO, WHAT SUCH DISCLOSURES SHOULD CONTAIN;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(e) THE TERMS NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS MAY AND MAY NOT USE TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AND THE PRACTICE OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(f) WHETHER, AND IN WHAT INSTANCES, IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS TO CONSULT OR COLLABORATE WITH PHYSICIANS LICENSED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 36 OF THIS TITLE;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(g) WHETHER THERE ARE TREATMENTS PERFORMED BY NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS THAT SHOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATIONS AND WHAT QUALIFICATIONS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUCH CERTIFICATIONS;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(h) THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF MALPRACTICE INSURANCE A NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CARRY; AND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(i) WHETHER NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PERFORM ANY OF THE PROHIBITED ACTS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12-37.7-107.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent amendment, according to Ms. Rosa, which is not yet in the online version of the bill, is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) THE TASK FORCE SHALL CONSIDER ISSUES RELATED TO THE PRACTICE AND REGULATION OF NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE. SUCH CONSIDERATION SHALL BE BASED UPON STANDARD EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY IN LIGHT OF QUALITY, PEER REVIEWED PUBLISHED OR WIDELY VETTED RESEARCH. THE ISSUES CONSIDERED SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NEED NOT BE LIMITED TO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) THE QUALIFICATIONS OF NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS AND WHAT SCOPE OF PRACTICE SHOULD GOVERN NATUROPATHIC MEDICINE IN COLORADO INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR NATUROPATHIC DOCTORS TO PERFORM;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ms. Rosa, the Colorado Medical Society believes that this amendment “will limit NDs to safe and effective practices.” The CMS is apparently naive to points 4 and 8 in my list at the beginning of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix, it would seem, is in. Linda Rosa responded to Ms. Protopapa by observing that key NDs are unconcerned about the “prohibitions,” because it would be ridiculously easy to get around them. Regarding treatment of cancer, for example, the bill states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCEPT THAT A NATUROPATHIC DOCTOR MAY TREAT CONCOMITANT CONDITIONS AND THE SYMPTOMS AND SIDE EFFECTS OF CANCER;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Rosa added, wryly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “degreed” naturopaths also admitted to long defying our Medical Practice Act. It seems the more they defy the law, the more support they find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, rumor has it CMS leadership is giving Colorado nurses a hard time at the capitol about their scope of practice…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ms. Protopapa replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linda,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill strictly prohibits naturopaths from treating cancer other than the symptoms and side effects. Any naturopath treating cancer outside of this narrowly defined criteria is violating the law. Fortunately, should this bill pass, consumers will now have an avenue for recourse if they are the victims of a naturopath treating cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect your concern with CMS, the Colorado Academy of Family Physicians [!–KA] and the Colorado Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatricians [!!–KA] supporting HB 1175 but as I stated earlier, these organizations worked diligently [!!!–KA] to craft legislation that creates a very narrow scope of practice in which naturopaths may practice and strong consumer protections. This is far more protection than what we currently have in place, which is nothing at all. Should you have any further concerns, you can reach me at the numbers below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your comments,&lt;br&gt;
Regards,&lt;br&gt;
Diana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which Ms. Rosa replied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Protopapa,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am amazed CMS leadership considers HB1175 to have “strong consumer protections.” Under HB1175, the “degreed” Naturopaths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Will have no requirement for malpractice insurance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Will have no defined scope of practice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Can conduct “naturopathic diagnoses,” whatever those are…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Can perform “naturopathic treatments,” whatever those are…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Must adhere to a *mythical* set of “generally accepted standards of naturopathic practice”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Are allowed to provide substandard, worthless, unvalidated or dangerous treatments to a child with the parent’s consent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding (ND) Rena Bloom’s statement about the bill’s restrictions: Naturopaths understand cancer in unconventional terms. They can characterize their treatment of cancer (e,g, “boosting the immune system” and “detoxifying”) as “concomitant” or “adjunctive” treatment, and hence allowed by HB1175.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amendment L005 to HB1175 exempts some 900 “traditional” naturopaths from the bill. There would be no restrictions that affect their practice. They could even continue to call themselves “naturopaths” or “NDs.” The degreed naturopaths are so hungry for state recognition that they have even forgone their pretense that this is a “consumer protection” bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers would be better protected by complaining to the Medical Board, as they do today, instead of to a lawyer who has the power to rule on all matters, including about what is appropriate and inappropriate practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only good thing about this bill is that another amendment has done away with the provision exempting registered/degreed NDs from the Medical Practice Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I urge CMS and the other two organizations to reconsider support of HB1175.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;
Linda Rosa, RN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay special attention to the amendment regarding “traditional” naturopaths, the obvious purpose of which is to remove a major source of opposition to a naturopathic practice act. “Educated” naturopaths always portray their petitions for regulation as a “public safety” issue (”don’t be fooled by fake psychics!”), and this group was no different—at first. The CMS fell for that gambit, as evidenced by each of Ms. Protopapa’s notes. Yet now it isn’t even part of the bill. As Linda Rosa observed, such cynicism was not lost on “traditional” naturopaths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One traditional ND summed up the situation. He told me that the degreed NDs are so desperate for legal recognition that they’ll give up anything to get it. I would add …but without the intention of giving up anything in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the CMS finally realize that the NDs real intent is to make themselves appear to be legitimate “health care providers,” with all the rewards of that designation, e.g., protection to practice their brand of quackery, greater patient volume, insurance coverage, etc.?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;∏=3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely. The naivete of the three medical organizations appears boundless. According to Linda Rosa, physician representatives of all three misused the term “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=21"&gt;allopathy&lt;/a&gt;” in their testimonies to the legislature. The bill itself repeats the usual falsehoods about science, medicine, and naturopathy, quoted verbatim from naturopathic litany, that exist in almost every &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=141"&gt;naturopathic practice act&lt;/a&gt;. That not one of these physicians seemed to recognize this, or at least to give a damn, is mind-numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only good news from Ms. Rosa is that the bill is not yet law:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill has only passed the House Health and Human Services Committee. It next goes to Appropriations. If Appropriations finds the bill will be more expensive than the bill anticipates, the bill will go back to the HHS Committee. (That’s how we killed it two years ago — i.e. showing it would cost the State of Colorado millions, based on a study done in Hawaii.) So the bill hasn’t faced a full House vote yet. No senate vote yet either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1992, this is the 6th try for an ND bill in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;British Columbia and Alberta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/theeditorialpage/story.html?id=dd0e40a5-24c7-41a6-b541-19e0e15d340a&amp;amp;k=29765"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt; in Wednesday’s Calgary Herald, British Columbia is considering allowing “naturopathic doctors” to prescribe pharmaceuticals and order x-rays:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;B. C. Minister of Health George Abbott says the regulations are about choice. Naturopaths would be limited to prescribing Schedule I and Schedule II drugs, including antibiotics, painkillers and anti-depressants. The naturopaths would also have authority to order lab X-rays, instead of having to refer their patients to a medical doctor to do paper work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an argument to be made for giving naturopathic doctors the power to prescribe certain drugs, such as those which replace natural hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Lofting, a naturopathic doctor and vice-president with the Alberta Association of Naturopathic Practitioners, says there’s really only a “handful” of medications that are useful to naturopaths, mainly hormones. Antibiotics are also important, in that a patient might have an infection, in which case naturopathic doctors have no choice but to send them to a medical doctor for treatment. That’s inconvenient, costly, and unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same article calls for “regulation” of naturopaths in Alberta (hmmm, I thought naturopathy was already a “&lt;a href="http://www.canlii.org/ab/laws/sta/h-7/20080818/whole.html"&gt;regulated profession&lt;/a&gt;” in Alberta), making the same, erroneous assumptions that are being made in Colorado:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger dilemma in Alberta is that this profession still needs to be regulated. Albertans deserve the choice of going to a naturopathic doctor and being assured certain standards, training and disciplinary measures are in place. A college has already been established, and rules written, but the province must first give final reading to the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lofting says the Health Ministry has indicated proclamation is expected during the current Parliamentary session. Considering the speed with which this profession is expanding next door, those regulations can’t come soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am out of time and out of gas, so I won’t discuss these misconceptions further. At this point it probably isn’t necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funeral is over; I went back to work yesterday; and it's time to reenter "regular" life again. To me that includes blogging. I do not know when or if I'll do a post about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_death_in_the_family.php"&gt;my mother-in-law's death from breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. I tried, and I'm just not ready yet. The only thing I can say is that work yesterday produced a strange sort of disconnect. Things just didn't seem real, and I had a hell of a time motivating myself to do anything that I didn't have to do. I'm sure I'll get over it soon enough. I have to. The old curse goes, "May you live in interesting times," and unfortunately around my cancer center right now times are interesting. When I'm ready, if I feel up to it, there are at least a couple of observations I could make, not the least of which is how much it sucks to know too much when someone you love is dying of cancer and how all hospices are not created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, again, not just yet. It's only been eight days; it's too raw; and I know my wife and other family read this blog. One thing I will say is that never have I witnessed such pure unselfishness and love as my wife demonstrated in putting her career on hold for nearly four months to head to Ohio and take care of her mother during her last days. Any complaint I might have had about being left alone for much of that time seems downright piteous in comparison to what my wife went through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I'd be remiss not to mention is how much I appreciated all of your comments after my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_death_in_the_family.php"&gt;announcement of my mother-in-law's passing&lt;/a&gt;. Many of you opened up in a way that I really appreciated, and I thank you. I do not appreciate the comments of a certain antivaccinationist loon whom I unfortunately had to deal on a couple of the occasions when I did check the blog to see what was going on. She knows who she is, and regular readers know who she is too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that my departure from the blogosphere coincided with one of the biggest developments on the vaccine front that I can recall in my four years of blogging, namely the judgment against the first test cases in the Autism Omnibus. Even though it's been a week, I may well have something to say about that on Monday. (Later today I will likely have something to say about one of the reactions to it by a certain pediatrician, simply because his comments outraged me and it's as good a place as any to jump back in, but a fuller discussion of the developments of the last week or two will have to wait a couple of more days.) After that, I hope to move away from vaccines for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if my return is too soon, but easing my way back into dishing out the Respectful and not-so-Respectful Insolence you've come to love--or hate, depending on who you are--now feels right.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004528" title=""&gt;Lipid Profile and Serum Characteristics of the Blind Subterranean Mole Rat, Spalax&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Spalax (blind subterranean mole rat), is a mammal adapted to live in fluctuating oxygen levels, and can survive severe hypoxia and hypercapnia. The adaptive evolution of Spalax to underground life resulted in structural and molecular-genetic differences comparing to above-ground mammals. These differences include higher myocardial maximal oxygen consumption, increased lung diffusion capacity, increased blood vessels density, and unique expression patterns of cancer and angiogenesis related genes such as heparanase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and P53. Here we elucidate the main characteristics of Spalax lipid profile, as well as its main antioxidant and serum parameters. Compared to human, Spalax possesses lower total-cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides levels, and higher levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B-100 were significantly lower in Spalax compared to human. Paraoxonase (PON) 1 arylesterase activity, was higher in Spalax compared to both human and mouse serum levels. Analysis of serum chemistry of Spalax revealed special features in this mammal. Spalax possesses a unique lipid profile with high HDL and low LDL lipoproteins. The antioxidant serum content in the mole rat is higher than that of human and mouse. Serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels are significantly lower in Spalax compared to that of human or mouse, reflecting low levels of inflammation. These differences between Spalax, human and mouse are due to several factors including the intensive activity life-style that Spalax pursue underground, dietary components, and evolutionary genetic adaptations. Unfolding the genetic basis of these differences will probably result in unique treatments for a variety of human diseases such as dyslipedemias, inflammation and cancer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004521" title=""&gt;Quantitative Trait Evolution and Environmental Change&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the recent changes in climate, there is an urgent need to understand the evolutionary ability of populations to respond to these changes. We performed individual-based simulations with different shapes of the fitness curve, different heritabilities, different levels of density compensation, and different autocorrelation of environmental noise imposed on an environmental trend to study the ability of a population to adapt to changing conditions. The main finding is that when there is a positive autocorrelation of environmental noise, the outcome of the evolutionary process is much more unpredictable compared to when the noise has no autocorrelation. In addition, we found that strong selection resulted in a higher load, and more extinctions, and that this was most pronounced when heritability was low. The level of density-compensation was important in determining the variance in load when there was strong selection, and when genetic variance was lower when the level of density-compensation was low. The strong effect of the details of the environmental fluctuations makes predictions concerning the evolutionary future of populations very hard to make. In addition, to be able to make good predictions we need information on heritability, fitness functions and levels of density compensation. The results strongly suggest that patterns of environmental noise must be incorporated in future models of environmental change, such as global warming.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_126.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/5PfzlBFQnus" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235106654888"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2263">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84e0b613908cfccd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="atheists"/><category term="Initiative Measure No. 1040"/><category term="Kimberlie Struiksma"/><category term="McCarthyism"/><category term="Washington"/><category term="witch hunt"/><title type="html">Atheist prohibition in Washington?</title><published>2009-02-20T05:01:35Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T05:01:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/atheist-prohibition-in-washington/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lynden.wednet.edu/district/pubs/board/minutes/July%2026,%202007%20Regular.htm"&gt;Kimberlie Struiksma&lt;/a&gt;, a woman involved in education in Washington, has just proposed the following measure to put on the ballot,  &lt;a href="http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/i1040.pdf"&gt;Initiative Measure No. 1040&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

This measure would require state government not to use public funds or property for anything that denies or attempts to refute the existence of a supreme ruler of the universe, including but not limited to appropriations for displays, textbooks, scientific endeavors, instruction, and research projects. The measure would provide that no person shall be questioned based on their personal values, beliefs, or opinions regarding the existence of a supreme ruler of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the answer to your question is, yes, she’s serious. The measure both explicitly declares a witch hunt against atheists and goes into length to explain that this is not discrimination. And not only does this try to silence atheists from even offending Christians but &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/washington_state_kook_wants_a.php"&gt;as PZ Myers points out in his blog&lt;/a&gt;, it attempts to silence science itself. It’ll probably never get anywhere but then again, Americans love a good witch hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/not_just_the_war_on_christmas.php"&gt;PZ also linked to an interview she gave&lt;/a&gt; that reveals her motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT SINCE Dick Van Patten’s Hobo Chili for Dogs have I confronted a product so strange and marvelously implausible that I feel robbed somehow of what might have been a beautiful, sublime joke, were it not all so undeniably real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aykroyd is also very into &lt;a href="http://www.ufosoverphoenix.com/UNPLUGGED.html"&gt;alien visitors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.psiberific.com/dan.htm"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Hodgman also added this update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: because they care about me, &lt;a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/10/is_this_dan_aykroyd_crystal_he.html"&gt;THE VULTURE&lt;/a&gt; POSITS that this may all be part of an oblique, GHOSTBUSTERS III viral campaign. I hope so. It would be one of the most beautiful deadpan jokes of all time, were it so. And worthy of Dan Aykroyd. But on the other hand, he does apparently have a real, non-joke, non-viral, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVf34XQtBfo"&gt;fascination&lt;/a&gt; with the paranormal, so who knows?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2009/02/19/skepchick_dan_aykroyd_and_the_kingd.php"&gt;Skepchick also references a brief  interview with Aykroyd&lt;/a&gt; where he mentions his belief in ghosts and psychics, and where he releases this little gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David Blaine has done a lot of work, and he really does levitate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

This morning, we had breakfast at the &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/hungarianpastryshop/" title=""&gt;Hungarian Pastry Shop&lt;/a&gt;, where I ordered my pastry using a Serbian name for the cake, and the Albanian woman working in the Hungarian shop understood what I wanted! I forgot to bring my camera with me today, and Mrs.Coturnix did not bring her cable, so the pictures of the pastries will have to wait our return home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Mrs.Coturnix went for a long walk (it was nice in the morning, got cold in the afternoon), ending up in the Met. I joined my co-panelists &lt;a href="http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/" title=""&gt;Jean-Claude Bradley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page" title=""&gt;Barry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://ginkgobioworks.com/" title=""&gt;Canton&lt;/a&gt; and our hosts Kathryn Pope, Rebecca Kennison and Rajendra Bose for lunch at &lt;a href="http://www.bistroten18.com/" title=""&gt;Bistro Ten 18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we walked over to the Columbia campus and got all set up for the &lt;a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/open-science-good-research-good-researchers" title=""&gt;Open Science panel&lt;/a&gt;. I talked first, giving a brief history of openness in scientific communication, defining Open Access publishing and how it fits in the evolving ecosystem of online science communication, ending with some speculation about the future. Jean-Claude and Barry then followed, describing their own projects, showing how some of that future that sounds so speculative when described in general terms, is already here, done by pioneers and visionaries right here and now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel was followed by a number of excellent questions from the audience - you could follow the discussion blow-by-blow on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ScholarlyComm" title=""&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; (several pages of it!), and the video of the entire thing will be posted online in a few days (I will make sure to link to it once it is available).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were some familar faces in the crowd - including  &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/caryn/profile" title=""&gt;Caryn Shechtman&lt;/a&gt; (who already wrote a &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/hubs/nyc/blog/2009/02/20/open-science-is-it-the-future-of-research" title=""&gt;nice blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it), my Overlords &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/" title=""&gt;Erin and Arikia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Michael Tobis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://spacecadetgirl.com/" title=""&gt;Talia Page&lt;/a&gt; (and her Mom who is writing an interesting book right now), &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/noah/blog" title=""&gt;Noah Gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/hilary/profile" title=""&gt;Hilary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://precedings.nature.com/" title=""&gt;Spencer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://parallelaphors.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Miriam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://fatscience.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Gordon&lt;/a&gt; (whose husband does interesting stuff with science education in high schools).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went for a beer nearby afterwards, where we were re-joined by Mrs.Coturnix. It got really cold, so we went back to the hotel, had some (too) authentic Chinese cuisine for dinner and are trying to rest as tomorrow is another busy day - meeting various famous people for various meals, including the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=50391599382" title=""&gt;Big Bash&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.oldtownbar.com/" title=""&gt;Old Town Bar&lt;/a&gt; at 8pm to which you are all invited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/quick_check-in_from_nyc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/yRB71O3YKVY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235101172793"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1059501936689386888">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40bc5567c16bc133</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Christianity Simply Reinvents Itself Over and Over in Every Generation</title><published>2009-02-20T01:50:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-20T03:50:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/GD6YTMJwFp0/christianity-simply-reinvents-itself.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/1059501936689386888/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=1059501936689386888" title="54 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/christianity-simply-reinvents-itself.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">One of my problems with the Christian faith is that in every generation it reinvents itself to face the challenges of each generation. One would think that if a faith that was "once and for all delivered unto the saints" (Jude 3) this wouldn't be the case.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian theology has changed so much that one would not even recognize the Christianities of the first century or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me just mention some theological changes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation &lt;/strong&gt;- Not until around 200-700 AD did the church accept creation ex-nihilo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hell &lt;/strong&gt;- From fire and brimstone to the absence of God to annihilation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baptism &lt;/strong&gt;- Probably from Immersion to sprinkling; from adults to infants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atonement &lt;/strong&gt;- From ransom to satisfaction to penal-substitutionary to moral influence to relationship theories&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predestination&lt;/strong&gt; - Possibly "mixed" to Calvinism to Arminianism to Calvinism back to Arminianism&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christology &lt;/strong&gt;- From Paul to Chalcedon to Kenotic theories&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration &lt;/strong&gt;- From who knows what to mechanical to verbal-plenary to inerrancy to neo-orthodoxy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women &lt;/strong&gt;- From servants who obey in quietness to teachers and ministers and professors&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slavery &lt;/strong&gt;- From Paul (Philemon) to southern Slavery to abolition to anti-racism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other theological ideas not mentioned, and there are many details to fill in about these particular ideas, but I dare say if today's Christians went back in time to first century Christianities they would not fit in, nor would they be considered orthodox in most Christian communities. Most all Christians today would actually reject the Christianities of the past. They would reject their theologies, their ethics, and perhaps their church polity (not mentioned previously). In fact, they would simply reject the Christianities of the past!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what happened is that the church reinvented herself over and over in every generation in response to the challenges of her day. The church and her theology is like a chameleon to me in this respect. But the point is that it changed so slowly that few notice in today's world these drastic changes. Christians today wouldn't even admit that many of the earliest Christianites would be considered Christianity at all! And I know for a fact that the Christianites that will exist in the future will almost certainly be considered strange to the Christianites that exist right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not looking for an explanation here, although I know what Christians will say. I'm simply pointing out that Christianity today is probably so far removed from the earliest Christianities that this is evidence that the church is a human not divine organization, one that flows downstream along with the history of human intellectual and cultural life. And I'm claiming this will continue to be true in the future too. At 54 years old I myself have seen these changes slowly take place inside the evangelical church for instance, with "Open Theism," the "Emergent Church," eschatological "Preterism," and an acceptance of babies out of wedlock, divorce in the church, abortion, homosexuality, and so forth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I ask, which Christianity is the correct one? There are a multitude of them which exist today all claiming to be the true church, but most all of the present ones would reject most all of the ones in the past, certainly the earliest ones.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do church history. Do historical theology. It'll probably change your views about the church being a divine institution. It's not at all. The evidence suggests otherwise. Follow the evidence, okay?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Elyse and I have listened, made notes, compared notes and finally picked the winner of this month’s contest.  It took us a good long while, since all the entries were top notch, but we bit the bullet and here are the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runner-ups (complete with comments from submitter):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tarrkid’s Playlist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Big Bang Theory Theme - Barenaked Ladies (duh)&lt;br&gt;
Survival - Yes&lt;br&gt;
Apeman - The Kinks&lt;br&gt;
Dear God - XTC (veering a little away from evolution, but you can’t deny this song’s stance and power)&lt;br&gt;
Shock the Monkey - Peter Gabriel&lt;br&gt;
What a Wonderful World - Louis Armstrong&lt;br&gt;
Also Sprach Zarathustra - Richard Strauss (mostly because of where it was used, but also it’s backstory)&lt;br&gt;
Why Does The Sun Shine? - They Might Be Giants&lt;br&gt;
Think For Yourself - The Beatles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zbfelt’s Playlist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

4. Changes - David Bowie  (I’ve never realized that this song was about evolution before! &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)"&gt; After all what is evolution if not changes in gene frequency.)&lt;br&gt;
5. I Will Survive - Aretha Franklin (Obvious survival of the fittest reference)&lt;br&gt;
6. Organic Coast - Hawksley Workman (On the Galapagos)&lt;br&gt;

9. I Could Write a Book - Rodgers/Hart (And boy did he ever)&lt;br&gt;
10. Respect - Aretha Franklin (Darwin should be given the utmost of this song title. “Cdesign propentists” upset me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley.Ele&lt;/strong&gt; {&lt;strong&gt;insert confetti and nosiemakers here&lt;/strong&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Gourds - Fossil Contender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, I got a knuckle, honey, and you got the fin&lt;br&gt;
But we don’t even know if this thing used to walk or swim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Dirty Dozen Brass Band - The Monkey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, three monkeys sat in a coconut tree&lt;br&gt;
Discussing things that are said to be&lt;br&gt;
Said one to the other, ‘Now listen you two&lt;br&gt;
There’s a sick rumor that can’t be true&lt;br&gt;
That man descended from our noble race&lt;br&gt;
Why the very idea is a big disgrace&lt;br&gt;
Why no monkey ever deserted his wife&lt;br&gt;
Starved her baby and ruined her life.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Later covered by Elvis Costello &amp;amp; The Imposters as “Monkey To Man”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. New York Dolls - Dance Like A Monkey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your design’s so intelligent&lt;br&gt;
Ain’t no way that was an accident&lt;br&gt;
Come on shake your monkey hips&lt;br&gt;
My pretty little creationist …&lt;br&gt;
Evolution is so obsolete&lt;br&gt;
Gotta stomp your hands and clap your feet&lt;br&gt;
You gotta dance like a monkey, dance like a monkey!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Pearl Jam - Do The Evolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m ahead, I’m a man&lt;br&gt;
I’m the first mammal to wear pants, yeah&lt;br&gt;
I’m at peace with my lust&lt;br&gt;
I can kill ’cause in God I trust, yeah&lt;br&gt;
It’s evolution, baby.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5a. Bad Religion - The World Won’t Stop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re only as elegant as your actions let you be&lt;br&gt;
A piece of chaos related phylogenetically&lt;br&gt;
To every living organ system, we’re siblings, don’t you see?&lt;br&gt;
The world rotates and will revolve without you constantly&lt;br&gt;
Two billion years thus far, now mister here you are&lt;br&gt;
An element in a sea of enthalpic organic compounds&lt;br&gt;
The world won’t stop without you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5b. Bad Religion - Part IV (The Index Fossil)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the human clock stops and the world stops ticking&lt;br&gt;
We’ll be an index fossil buried in our own debris.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5c. Bad Religion - Modern Man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Modern man, evolutionary betrayer&lt;br&gt;
Modern man, ecosystem destroyer&lt;br&gt;
Modern man, destroy yourself in shame&lt;br&gt;
Modern man, pathetic example of earth’s organic heritage&lt;br&gt;
Just a sample of carbon-based wastage&lt;br&gt;
Just a fucking tragic epic of you and I.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Combining the 3 songs into 1 slot since none of the songs are specifically about evolution, but all reference evolution in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Minutemen - History Lesson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“100,000 years ago&lt;br&gt;
Homo sapiens stood erect&lt;br&gt;
Mind empty, mind fresh&lt;br&gt;
Created love and hate&lt;br&gt;
Created God and anti-God&lt;br&gt;
Human slaughtered human for power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Louis Prima - I Wan’na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&lt;br&gt;
–from The Jungle Book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanna be like you&lt;br&gt;
I wanna walk like you&lt;br&gt;
Talk like you, too&lt;br&gt;
You’ll see it’s true&lt;br&gt;
An ape like me&lt;br&gt;
Can learn to be human, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Devo - Jocko Homo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God made man&lt;br&gt;
But he used the monkey to do it&lt;br&gt;
Apes in the plan&lt;br&gt;
Were all here to prove it&lt;br&gt;
I can walk like an ape&lt;br&gt;
Talk like an ape&lt;br&gt;
I can do what a monkey can do&lt;br&gt;
God made man&lt;br&gt;
But a monkey supplied the glue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Bruce Springsteen - Part Man, Part Monkey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They prosecuted some poor sucker in these United States&lt;br&gt;
For teaching that man descended from the apes&lt;br&gt;
They could’ve settled that case without a fuss or fight&lt;br&gt;
If they’d seen me chasin’ you, sugar, through the jungle last night&lt;br&gt;
They’d of called in that jury and a 1-2-3 said&lt;br&gt;
Part man, part monkey, definitely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Johnny Clegg &amp;amp; Savuka - Scatterlings Of Africa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ancient bones from Olduvai&lt;br&gt;
Echoes of the very first cry&lt;br&gt;
‘Who made me, here and why?&lt;br&gt;
Beneath this copper sun.’&lt;br&gt;
My very first beginnings&lt;br&gt;
Beneath the copper sky&lt;br&gt;
Lie deeply buried&lt;br&gt;
In the dust of Olduvai.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On February 19 Dr. Ian Musgrave posted to the Panda’s Thumb a brief rebuttal ( see &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/it-would-help-i.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ) to Angus Menuge’s supposed “review” of the anthology &lt;em&gt;Why Intelligent Design Fails&lt;/em&gt; (WIDF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian replied only to Menuge’s treatment of Ian’s chapter in the anthology, showing that Menuge’s review of that chapter is a chunk of piffle.  I fully agree with Ian’s opinion, and may add that the same can be said about Menuge’s treatment of every other chapter in the anthology. His “review” of chapter 11, of which I was the author, is a good example.(The text of my chapter is available online &lt;a href="http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Chap11.pdf" rel="external "&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know next to nothing about Menuge (I believe I heard he has a degree in chemistry) but his review of my chapter betrays his ignorance of the subject discussed in my chapter.  In that chapter I demonstrated Dembski’s misinterpretation of the No Free Lunch theorems by Wolpert &amp;amp; MacReady.   Dembski’s thesis boiled down to the assertion that the NFL theorems prohibit evolution, which, therefore, is impossible. Of course, the NFL theorems do nothing of the sort, and Dembski displayed an impressive, for a mathematician, lack of understanding of the matter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what has Menuge found worth rebutting in my chapter? In his review there is not a single word regarding the main points of my chapter.  Instead, he found there a single statement worth (in his view) discussing, which is a secondary point, in no way crucial for my argument. Even about that statement he could not say anything of substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that statement I claimed that the question of natural evolutionary algorithms being capable of climbing up the naturally occurring fitness landscapes belongs in the discussion of anthropic coincidences. Menuge referred to my statement using the words that I “admit” (rather than “state”) my notion.  By this trick Menuge apparently tried to create the impression that the statement in question negated my thesis about Dembski’s misuse of the NFL theorems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact I had nothing to “admit,” and it must be clear to any reader of an average intelligence that my notion about anthropic coincidences in no way contradicted my critique of Dembski’s fallacious discourse.  It is obvious that Menuge just could not come up with any reasonable rebuttal of my chapter, so he resorted to an irrelevant and meaningless comment about a secondary point, while avoiding discussion of the gist of my chapter. Quite likely, he had no choice as he probably just could not comprehend my arguments because of his insufficient understanding of the NFL theorems and all the related stuff, but had the gall to pretend to be capable of judging it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of the above, Menuge’s conclusion that the arguments in the anthology in question are “not so fatal “ for ID as the authors of the anthology claimed is nothing more than the usual for ID advocates attempt to present their dreams as reality.
&lt;/p&gt;

Lexie's death was originally ruled a homicide; Gregg-Glover, her adoptive mother had been charged with felony child neglect and filing a false police report in her disappearance and will likely now face a murder charge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.informationliberation.com/files/closet.jpg" height="237" alt="Timeout room from Information Liberationr" style="float:left" width="180"&gt;Sometimes I think that I will be saying this till I'm beyond blue in the face: &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/padded-cells-and-physical-restraints/"&gt;Physical restraints and padded rooms&lt;/a&gt;---the use of force and of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_report_on_the_use_of_seclusion_amp_restraints"&gt;seclusion&lt;/a&gt;---are inappropriate and potentially dangerous when used to "manage" the "challenging behaviors" that a child on the autism spectrum may have.  The February 18th &lt;a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/education/story/3821C6F7E0BAC5F486257561007202A3?OpenDocument"&gt;St. Louis Today&lt;/a&gt; reports that parents of two children are accusing the Francis Howell School District of "abusing and neglecting" students with disabilities by using such padded "timeout" rooms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three parents spoke out Wednesday against the use of these rooms. Sharon and Ben VonHarz say their 11-year-old son, who has autism, suffered bruises and emotional trauma after he was repeatedly put in a seclusion room at Hollenbeck Middle School. &lt;a href="http://nomoseclusion.blogspot.com/"&gt;Ange Hemmer&lt;/a&gt; said a seclusion room was used with her son, who has autism and is now 9, when he was in kindergarten at Fairmount Elementary School. They said other parents are afraid to step forward in fear of retaliation from the school district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The district had tried to make me believe my child was a monster and that this was the only way to educate my child," Hemmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A padded room seems hardly the "only" way to educate a child and especially a child with disabilities who may not be able to readily explain themselves, or who may  not be able to speak at all.  My son has never been in a padded room (though there certainly are &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/padded-or-concrete-the-quiet-room/"&gt;school districts in New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; that have been accused of using them, and of misusing them.  When he was younger, special ed teachers used &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_2_new_law_in_tennessee"&gt;restraints&lt;/a&gt; like the basket hold when he head-banged. While they may have stopped this from continuing in the short term, the long-term effects have been deleterious: Let's just say that Charlie's got a lot of fight in him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education, not force, has helped Charlie most of all. It's often such a slow, slow process and often it seems that Charlie has to unlearn things as much as learn them. His teacher knows he more than has the capacity not only to learn, but to succeed and make his way in the world, but he needs to be taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And restraints and seclusion are not education.&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to post it here on Skepchick in case anyone else was thinking of giving Facebook their cell phone number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook just published my cell phone number on my profile without my permission. To give an idea of how much that sucks, know that I have 2,200 “friends”, since I have a high-traffic web site and a popular podcast, so I add (pretty much) everyone who says they’re a fan. For that reason, I’ve always kept my private information off the site, except for a catch-all email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened: Today, I noticed that my Facebook status was not being updated with my Twitter updates (they’ve been linked for many months now). I logged on to Facebook to update my status manually, but was stopped by a Captcha request. The pop-up explained that this was to stop potential spammers, and that if I wanted to avoid future Captcha requests, I could verify my account so Facebook would know I’m a real person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seemed fair enough, and I’ve gone through similar steps on other sites with no problem. I clicked on the “more info” link, read everything to be confident my information would remain private, doublechecked to make sure it was actually Facebook asking for the info, and then went ahead and entered my number. I got the text, entered it, and “verified” my account. At no time did I manually change my profile information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, I received a message on Facebook asking if that was really my number on my profile. That’s when I saw that my number had been made public, and an update had been sent to all my Facebook friends saying that I had entered my phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve no idea who got the number before I deleted it. I’ll be changing my number soon in order to avoid prank calls and crazy stalkers and well-meaning fans, which is going to be a huge pain. Mostly I’m just shaken and upset that the site would do such a stupid thing with personal information, and am now weighing my options about shutting down my profile, which would be a shame since I find it so helpful to keep in touch with both friends and fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that since Consumerist started the ToS uproar, you may be interested in this, and I’d be interested to known if anyone else has had this happen to them. One of my Twitter followers just posted that his Facebook friend feed is suddenly full of notices from friends adding their cell phones – how many of them know their numbers are public?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your great site. I’ll let you know if I get a response from Facebook (my email is below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Watson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my letter to abuse@facebook.com:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your system just published my cell phone number without my permission. I was asked to “verify” my account to avoid entering a Captcha every time I update my status, and two hours later someone messaged me to tell me that my cell phone number is freely available on my profile page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your FAQ says;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will my phone number be displayed in my profile?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your number is only shown if you entered the number in your profile contact info. From the Contact tab of the Edit My Profile page, you can determine what contact information is displayed on your profile and who is permitted to see this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please explain how this happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Watson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s sort of what the screen looks like (similar text but in my case it was in a pop-up window. This is a screenshot I took after removing my phone number from their system. If anyone has an actual shot of what the pop-up looks like, I’d love to see it). Notice the lack of warning that your number is about to be publicized.&lt;/p&gt;

This will apparently be proclaimed, not just to the world via the Internet, but to the &lt;a href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/"&gt;Royal College of Psychiatrists'&lt;/a&gt; annual meeting, by Professor Michael Fitzgerald, of Dublin's Trinity College. (loved the title on the first link, but a slightly better version of the story is &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/139428.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it's Darwin's 200th birthday, and autism is hot in the news.  Posthumous diagnosis is kind of fun too, with one of the more famous posthumous diagnoses of course being Albert Einstein.  Less famous, but my own personal Hero and co-founder of my field of study &lt;a href="http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/"&gt;Alan Turing&lt;/a&gt; has also been given a posthumous diagnosis.  And not just scientists may get the post-h Dx treatment: wikipedia has an entire entry that is nothing but &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_speculated_to_have_been_autistic"&gt;a list of posthumously diagnosed famous people&lt;/a&gt;.  It's of course always nice to get some positive press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's a little troubling to me as well, because these extremely important figures from history 1) are, like other extremely important figures from history,  exceptional, and 2) dead, and whether or not they are diagnosable based on history books is perhaps debatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people simply are exceptional.  Most famous people, whether or not they are "neurologically typical" have exceptional skill, talent, and luck.  While someone's neurological make-up will contribute to their talents, skills, focus, and sense of identity, I worry when a parent comes to me and says something to the effect of, "my kid isn't at all like Einstein how do I figure out how to access his super powers?"  (That's not a joke--it's happened to me, more than once, and makes me sad.)  Not all non-autistic people have exceptional skills.  And neither do all autistic people.  The chance of an autistic person changing world paradigms is, I would guess, just as slim as the chance of a non-autistic person changing world paradigms.  That doesn't mean we can't all dream of being Einstein (or in my case, Turing), but it's not going to happen just by virtue of having an autistic brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Darwin was autistic.  Perhaps he was not.  Either way, and for whatever reason, he did something exceptional.  Which is more than I, or most people, ever will.  And that's pretty groovy as long as care is taken not to read more into the situation than is actually there.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235084663333"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/quote_of_the_day_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/491c7820375b583f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Quote of the day</title><published>2009-02-19T22:35:46Z</published><updated>2009-02-19T22:35:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/jmRx9KhP7hs/quote_of_the_day_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/quote_of_the_day_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a real &lt;a href="http://www.mlive.com/opinion/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/02/letter_why_didnt_flight_crew_m.html"&gt;letter from Muskegon, Michigan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Feb. 8 "60 Minutes" program, we were captivated while viewing the Katie Couric interview of the crew and passengers of Flight 1549.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, we were struck there was not one mention of God, who directs pilots of planes and secures the safety of passengers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We have written CBS and asked them for more realistic programming. Help protect our freedoms. Write CBS about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fine right up through &amp;quot;not one mention of God&amp;quot;, then swoooosh, it plummets off the cliff of insanity into the sucking sludge-pit of unreality. God keeps planes safe? More god = realistic programming? Fawning over a deity protects our freedoms? Nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reassuring note, though, is that most of the comments on the letter are scathing. Not everyone in Muskegon is quite so wacky, apparently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/quote_of_the_day_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jmRx9KhP7hs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235084593579"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/19/free-thoughts/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27ab53e48128f186</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="IYA"/><title type="html">Free thoughts</title><published>2009-02-19T23:00:36Z</published><updated>2009-02-19T23:00:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/19/free-thoughts/" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://www.americanfreethought.com/wordpress/podpress_trac/web/230/0/afpodcast043.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="33107749"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was interviewed a little while ago by the American Freethought Podcast, and &lt;a href="http://www.americanfreethought.com/wordpress/2009/02/17/podcast-43-phil-plait/"&gt;it’s now online&lt;/a&gt; (here’s &lt;a href="http://www.americanfreethought.com/wordpress/podpress_trac/web/230/0/afpodcast043.mp3"&gt;the direct link to the MP3&lt;/a&gt;).

I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a sensible purpose to it, but the English language is such a tangle that it was easy to say something trivial that would take ages for me to dissect and diagram. Don&amp;#39;t ask me to do it now, I&amp;#39;ve forgotten every bit of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's still amusing, though, to see these articles that diagram sentences spoken by a couple of well known people. Examine &lt;a href="http://www.themillionsblog.com/2009/02/diagramming-obama-sentence.html"&gt;one of Obama's sentences&lt;/a&gt;, and compare it to &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2201158/"&gt;Sarah Palin's words&lt;/a&gt;.

I was sure I’d be branded a tool of Satan or worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As any religion writer will tell you, reporters on the faith beat get the nastiest hate mail and phone calls in the newsroom. In my eight years reporting on religion for The Times, I had people of God cuss me out, threaten me, put up a creepy website designed to “bring Lobdell down,” and predict with a great deal of satisfaction that I would spend eternity in hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When my essay was published, I was right about one thing: the response was huge. People read about my 20-year journey from evangelical Christian to reluctant atheist and sent e-mails in record numbers to the paper and to me. I personally received nearly 3,000 messages—a record for a single story at The Times. But here’s what I didn’t expect. The vast majority of them—I’m talking 99 percent—were supportive in their own way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Christians tried to reconvert me, sending me books, tapes, videos and testimonies that formed a small mountain on my desk. Others readers suggested I try their faith, claiming I’d find spiritual peace as a Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Unitarian, Jehovah’s Witness, and Mormon. The atheists welcomed me into the fold (though some pointed out that it took me an awful long time to get to the obvious truth).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But most readers simply thanked me for honestly expressing my doubts about faith and revealing how tortured and helpless I felt as I lost my once-firm grip on Christianity. Many had privately wrestled with their own demons before keeping or leaving their faith. But they all said talking openly about doubt was discouraged—at their place of worship and their home. Several e-mails came from pastors who no longer believed in God but felt they couldn’t tell a soul. Another arrived from deep inside the Vatican. All said they felt like outcasts with no place to turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It reminded me of Mother Teresa, one of the most revered religious persons of our time. She symbolized for millions the beauty of Christian devotion, sacrifice, holiness and works. But she suffered excruciating doubt. Recently published letters in &lt;em&gt;Come By My Light&lt;/em&gt; reveal that she felt absent from God for the last 50 years of her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frustrated, ashamed, and sometimes in doubt about God’s existence, Mother Teresa kept her spiritual crisis a secret from everyone but a few spiritual mentors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Please pray specially for me that I may not spoil His work and that Our Lord may show Himself — for there is such terrible darkness within me, as if everything was dead,” she wrote in 1953.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Jesus has a very special love for you,” she assured one mentor in 1979. “[But] as for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great, that I look and do not see, — Listen and do not hear — the tongue moves [in prayer] but does not speak ... I want you to pray for me — that I let Him have [a] free hand.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Mother Teresa doubted God’s existence for five decades, imagine how many people of all faiths secretly harbor doubts about their religion. Several recent studies have shown that there’s little difference in the moral behavior of evangelical Christians and atheists. I’d argue that’s because both groups don’t really believe, deep down, that God is real. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it’s time for religious doubt to come out of the closet and be dealt openly and thoughtfully. I was honored (and a little surprised) that Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena made my essay required reading for faculty and students. Seminary leaders wanted to address the issue of doubt head-on, which is the healthy course to take. If Christianity is true, its teachers can dispel just about any doubt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a different theory. I think there are so many closet doubters because people sense there’s no God who personally intervenes in their lives. But they can’t take the final step toward deism, agnosticism or atheism because the religious ties that bind us are thick. I know. I was a closet atheist for four years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Optimistic Christians ask me if the outpouring of concern, love and support after my original essay was published restored my faith in religion. It didn’t. But it did give me a new appreciation of humanity. Most of us are doubters to one degree or another. And there’s comfort in knowing you’re not alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This revelation recalled other instances of fakery from reports of sectarian medicine (”CAM”) successes. The Medical Council information contained evidence that the data from the now famous Wakefield cases used to claim an association of the MMR vaccine with childhood autism and inflammatory bowel disease were misinterpreted, altered, and to some extent, faked. The report and history were reviewed by David Gorski last week. In eight of twelve cases, the dates of autism onset were “rearranged” to fit the needed time association, and many small bowel biopsies were “reinterpreted” to show inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wakefield claims were long suspected by reputable medical scientists and skeptics  as being erroneous or fraudulent.  Note: the Council hearings are still in progress, and the Times report is subject to legal complaint.  The original details can also be seen in the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;Times articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This expose’ adds to a growing list of reports with erroneous and faked information in medical journals used either for economic reward, undeserved fame, or to promote ideological claims for medical sects and cults. Although history of erroneous or false claims goes back hundreds of years, the altering or synthesizing of data passing the recently conceived peer review system is new,  illuminating defects in the journal peer review and editing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If journals were invented in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, and operated like journals of today, Mesmer’s demonstrations might have been published, and the Ben Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier and French Academy’s disproof might have been rejected. (Laughter here.) But journals continue to make major goofs in publishing implausible results despite the popularity of a famous specialty journal for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples vary from acceptance of language manipulation - “alternative,” “healing,” “integrative,” etc., to the fakery of recent papers showing effects of prayer. The two famous studies of prayer in the cardiac care unit ranged from the unadmitted breaking of the blind in the Bird study (So Med J 1988; 81:826-826) to unadmitted imbalances of subject and control groups (Harris, Arch Int Med 1999;159:2273-2278.) And from those to the likely fakery of the distant prayer study of &lt;em&gt;in vitro &lt;/em&gt;fertilization (Cha, Wirth, Lobo; J Reprod Med 2001:46;781-786) in which three separate prayer groups on two continents improved pregnancy rates in a group of women on a third continent by an implausible 100 percent. In all of these cases, the papers passed peer or editorial review despite the methodological defects that were picked up by us skeptics (K. Atwood, K.Courcey [an RN] B. Flamm, and others.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding insult to the above, Annals of Internal Medicine published a systematic review of intercessory prayer (Astin et al, Ann Int Med, 2000;132: 903-910) containing not only the Bird and Harris studies counted as positive, but also the Targ study on brain tumors, found by reporter Po Bronson to have had its end point altered by the authors when the primary one showed no effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topping that, the same review contained four more papers by the same co-author of the of the &lt;em&gt;in vitro &lt;/em&gt;fertilization study, counting two of them as positive. We have evidence that those four studies also were never performed. The author of the four was just released from Federal prison where he had been for four years on a fraud conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topping even that, the review claimed to have found 15/23 papers that met their criteria to have been positive. Yet many articles were not from commonly recognized peer reviewed journals, but nine were from “CAM” advocacy journals, six were from “alternative” nursing journals, and one was from a medical news magazine.  (Sampson W. Are systematic reviews…sufficient as well as necessary for assessing medical effectiveness of prayer? Sci Rev Altern Med, 2000;4:(2)12-16. )  The review was made famous by national TV reporter Timothy Johnson of ABC, and by Hillary Clinton, who proclaimed it to prove the power of prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recent famous cases of misinterpretation or misrepresentation include the Benveniste homeopathy lab tests (I will present those data later), the several clinical trials of psychological support for cancer (Lancet again and still going on) and even the original survey of “CAM” use in the US published in 1993 in the New England Journal. All of these and more led to increased false belief in the populace, and may have cost a number of lives indirectly by furthering belief in .he “CAM” cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the factual details, we are faced with several meta-phenomena (or, are they more basic underlying phenomena?) One is the inability of any system to control the activities within it; and to decide which of several solutions works best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should journals deal with fraud and misrepresentation? If they detected misrepresentation perfectly, there would be few positive articles on quackery and sectarianism like “CAM“. Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet stood by the Wakefield paper through much of the criticism. Even though he vouched for the report’s authenticity, as I recall, he is of the school that favors research papers and commentaries having maximum freedom for publication, and that the normal give and take of scientific replication and debate will in the end determine validity. Others continue to develop stricter guidelines and safeguards against fraud and misrepresentation. At times the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors policies look like a stimulus bill or the military budget. Nevertheless, as per John Ioannidis, even when working ideally, most research findings are “false,“ or as I’d prefer, erroneous. But there is a wide difference between unrecognized bias and error and scientific fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An entirely laissez faire policy is a cop-out, producing little to no need for editors or reviewers other than copy editors. The present situation is a matter of peer review failure, in my opinion. No doubt there are many reasons for the failure, but failure it is, because peer review advocates promise more than can be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the failure lies human nature. Who has never tried to rationalize inclusion of an inconsistent finding , or the inverse, discard a finding that did not fit what one had in mind? (Rather than investigate and try to explain it rationally.) Psychologists have names for the ways the human mind leads to wrong conclusions and wrong beliefs. They are universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, what makes people who submit falsified manuscripts publish tick? That’s minor mental error gone berserk. Reading Dr. Wakefield’s protestations recalls the arguments for krebiozen, oxygen therapies, Laetrile, arguments against HIV as cause of AIDS, complete with imagined conspiracies, paranoid arguments of persecution, railing against unjust laws and rational interpretations. Not long ago, Val Jones suggested looking into quacks’ personalities for answers. Personalizing the necessary terms produces legal problems, especially in the UK and Canada, and also problems of how to study subjects who reject study. Yet Val opened a vast area for questioning.  I’ve called the phenomenon “localized intellectual deficit,“ and “intellectual sociopathy.“ But so far it doesn’t help much. maybe the media haven’t caught on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two last questions: How much fraud is recognized on peer review? Perhaps this has been studied…I don’t know. Does the allowance of fraudulent and misrepresented material augment anti-sciencers’ arguments against rationality and science? Speculate among yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, we live with a need for after-publication recognition of fraud and misdirection, and with satisfying ourselves living within the limitations of our observations. And also recognizing when reviewers and editors also fail.&lt;/p&gt;

An &lt;a href="http://www.bellinghamherald.com/102/story/800162.html"&gt;interview with the woman behind the proposal&lt;/a&gt; reveals several things: 1) she really is something of an incoherent dingleberry, and 2) the primary impetus for this idea was — don&amp;#39;t be surprised — creationism.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think probably at least that more creation science is overlooked as not belonging in the public school system because of the religion (aspect)," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boston (or a certain portion thereof) is abuzz with the opening of the new House of Blues on Landsdowne Street, which if you’ll recall &lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2009/02/18/house_of_blues_a_house_of_bogus.php"&gt;we were unable to appreciate&lt;/a&gt; due to certain screw-ups during the sneak preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actor, comedian, and Canadian Dan Aykroyd is a partner of the chain, and so Jonathon Soroff interviewed him in the latest &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/www.improper.com"&gt;Improper Bostonian&lt;/a&gt;. These days, pretty much any interview with Aykroyd is comedy gold, thanks to his weird beliefs in &lt;a href="http://www.ufosoverphoenix.com/UNPLUGGED.html"&gt;alien visitors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.psiberific.com/dan.htm"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://crystalheadvodka.com/"&gt;crystal skulls with magical healing powers possibly originating from the lost civilization of Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, seriously, please click the previous link and watch the unintentionally hilarious sales video, which writer and Brookline native &lt;a href="http://areasofmyexpertise.blogspot.com/2008/10/crystal-head-vodka.html"&gt;John Hodgman&lt;/a&gt; described as such: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT SINCE Dick Van Patten’s Hobo Chili for Dogs have I confronted a product so strange and marvelously implausible that I feel robbed somehow of what might have been a beautiful, sublime joke, were it not all so undeniably real.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brief Improper interview Aykroyd mentions his interest and belief in ghosts and psychics, but the best quote has got to be this: “David Blaine has done a lot of work, and he really does levitate.” &lt;/p&gt;

When they asked me to come back, it wasn’t hard to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roster for this year is even better, if possible. Almost all the living Moonwalking astronauts will be there, and as a bonus we’ll have the entire Apollo 9 crew as well as Michael Collins. Plus there’s artwork, talks by scientists, authors, and astronauts, and lots of fun. I’ll be giving two talks; my Moon Hoax talk (I can’t decide if I hope Buzz is there or not; I think he’d get a kick out of the talk, but I’d be terrified to stand in front of him and give it. What if he &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/sibrel.html"&gt;punches&lt;/a&gt; me?) and a black holes talk based on my book. I’ll be signing books there too. &lt;/p&gt;

However, one of the wealthiest autism charities in the U.S., &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/"&gt;Autism Speaks&lt;/a&gt;, seems to feel that child abuse is a topic "too political" for it to "muddy up the name" with.  Shocking?  Unfortunately, it's not even fiction.  (And fortunately for parents fighting against discrimination, other charities have less "muddy" priorities.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Why did you contact Autism Speaks and how did you make that contact?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.justiceforalexbarton.com/"&gt;Melissa Barton&lt;/a&gt;: I contacted members of our local chapter Treasure Coast to get &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/5-year-old-boy-voted-out-of-his-class/"&gt;support for Alex&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/should_wendy_portillo_still_be_teaching"&gt;Wendy Portillo's appeal&lt;/a&gt;. I was told by an insider at the school board that teachers were forming a group to support Wendy Portillo's actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Did you have any specific hopes or expectations about the response you would get?  If so, what were they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa: I was hoping that the group would be able to send supporters of my cause, ending autism discrimination in public schools. My insider was right, even the ESE Chair from Morningside Elementary School Cathy Oliver was wearing a ribbon in SUPPORT of Wendy Portillo's outrageous actions. I could have used a little mommy power at that point. Thank God, I had Dee Reynolds, a mother from Wendy Portillo's class who[se] child voted for Alex, and a parent, Anna Moore, who has her plate full with restraint and seclusion in Saint Lucie County, supporting Alex. Without these two, I would have been all alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What was the actual response you got from Autism Speaks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa: The response surprised me, as recently I joined the members at a kick off dinner for the Treasure Coast AS Walk. I was going to walk in support of Alex and I was hoping to get the word out to members about the abuses that are taking place right under their nose.  Here is the response: "It is too political for them to be involved with."  "Autism Speaks would say no to anyone with the same situation.  They don't like to muddy up the name so to speak.  Don't let this deter you.  Autism Speaks is silently in your corner." This comes from an unidentified, by my choice active (board) I don't know if this the correct term - member of AS in my local area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Do you have any opinions or ideas as to why Autism Speaks responded that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa: I think it is as they said. Too political. But, what is political about CHILD ABUSE? or DISCRIMINATION? We cannot let abusers free and blame politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Did you contact any other autism-related organizations for similar reasons, and if so, which organizations and how did they respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa: &lt;a href="http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer"&gt;ASA&lt;/a&gt; responded greatly, they even tried to find someone to fly in from out of state. &lt;a href="http://autisticadvocacy.org"&gt;ASAN&lt;/a&gt; also tirelessly made contact with as many people who [will] to them about Alex's case [and] have made frequent contact with me and are a true tower of strength. [There's also] Paul Sopp [561-683-5612] from Sopp Law West Palm Beach legal representation at no upfront fee. &lt;a href="http://familyadvocacyresources.com/"&gt;Family Advocacy Resources&lt;/a&gt; West Palm Beach has been calling me on a daily basis and making contact with other parents in our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What one or two things could any autism-related organization have done (or maybe is already doing?) to have made things easier for you and your family in the recent past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa: They can step up to the plate, and many have this was an exception. Sometimes all I ask is that we work the power of cyberspace; sometimes I need a little more. We are in a civil rights war zone down here and us parents could use some help. It's bad here, really bad. We have taken this at the belly of the beast. I never expected to be in this fight, I never knew it even existed. My eyes are open now. Sometimes I feel like I am the only one SCREAMING the emperor has no clothes but, then I am reminded that there are other parents who feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Is there anything in particular you wish autism-related organizations would do to help prevent injustice for students on the spectrum in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa: Scream to the top of your powerful lungs until you pass out. Really, I am working on a network of parents who will get the word out. Everyone has a gift, I have ten years of marketing / advertising experience that I have been using for local parents who[se] story needs to be heard. Some parents refuse the media as help but, honestly in this situation, it's all we have. Autism-related organizations need to understand that the retaliation from standing up for your ASD child is hard to deal with, I have exceptionally thick skin but, every time something happens to me I wonder how other parents would deal with the situation. Many have told me that they would have no choice but to bow out of the battle. This is where autism-related organizations need to stand firm. It's hard, but I will fight this until the end not because of a vendetta, not because of a lawsuit but, because if I don't it will happen again. I don't always sleep well at night, but I would never be able to live with myself knowing I could have saved a life and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to leave you with this, every news story you hear about is real there are real lives behind that story. Real fights to be won and lost. Without you and your support, we will fail our children. One parent alone can not do this. If you want to change the future now is your chance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm going to
break that promise. But it's in a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If you're a decent engineer, one of the basic principles you should
follow is keeping this as simple as possible. One of the essential skills
for keeping things simple is realizing when you're making something
overly complicated - even if it's cool, and fun, and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Working out the rope code for more complex operations, I found myself
thinking that it really seemed complex for what I was doing. What I'm
doing is writing myself a text editor. I'm not writing a string
processing framework for managing gigabytes of data; I'm just writing a
text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So I decided to try, for the purposes of testing, to look at one of
the simpler data structures. A classic structure for implementing editor
buffers is called a &lt;em&gt;gap buffer&lt;/em&gt;. I'll explain the details below.
The drawback of a gap buffer is that large cursor motions are relatively
expensive - the cost of moving the cursor is proportional to the distance
that you move it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So I wrote a test. I implemented a basic gap buffer. Then I built a
test that did 300,000 inserts of five characters; then slid the cursor
from the end, to the beginning, back to the end, back to the beginning,
and back to the end again. Total execution time? 150 milliseconds. And
that includes resizing the buffer 12 times, because of a deliberately
stupid buffer sizing and copying strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And with that, out the window went the ropes. Because &lt;em&gt;in Java&lt;/em&gt;, 
using a slapped together, sloppy piece of test code, which does things in a dumb
brute force way, it can do something much more complicated than anything an editor
will encounter in routine use, the gap buffer achieves performance that is more than
adequately fast. (Based on some experiments I did back at IBM, delays of 1/10th
of a second are roughly when people start to notice that an editor is slow. If you can respond is less than 1/10th of a second, people don't perceive a troublesome delay.)
If the gap buffer can achieve the needed perfomance that easily, then there's
absolutely &lt;em&gt;no reason&lt;/em&gt; to do anything more complicated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/02/gap_buffers_or_why_bother_with_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/02/gap_buffers_or_why_bother_with_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/o2Odz7qHkM0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235065748629"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/choprawoo_and_magical_thinking_two_crapp_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc8fd813bb80c6ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Choprawoo and magical thinking: Two crappy tastes that taste crappy together</title><published>2009-02-19T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-19T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/d_G810uSaMw/choprawoo_and_magical_thinking_two_crapp_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/choprawoo_and_magical_thinking_two_crapp_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Classic Insolence logo" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2006/08/ClassicInsolence.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, as we have been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/an_open_letter_to_seth_aronson_about_his.php"&gt;dreading&lt;/a&gt; for the last four months or so since her relapse was diagnosed, my mother-in-law passed away from breast cancer in hospice. She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging, and even if I did my wife needs me more. Because I foresaw this coming, however, I do have a series of "Best of" reposts lined up. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks. Right now I just don't know. This post originally appeared two years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I was, puttering around the Internet trying to procrastinate while writing yet another grant, when I came across a &lt;a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/01/intelligence.html"&gt;truly inane article&lt;/a&gt; by Scott Adams arguing that the entire universe must be intelligent because processes that lead to products of intelligent (machines, books, etc., made by us) must also be intelligent. (At least I think that's what he was arguing; the argument was so poorly constructed and circular that it was hard to tell. No doubt Adams will retreat to his "I was only joking" or "I was only playing with your mind" defense.) I thought of having a little fun with it, but unfortunately for me, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/omnibrain/2007/01/the_dilbert_blog_weighs_in_on.php"&gt;Omni Brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/will_scott_adams_never_learn.php"&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt; had already mentioned it, and, worse for me, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/will_scott_adams_never_learn.php"&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007/01/the_pointyhaired_cartoonist.php"&gt;The Questionable Authority&lt;/a&gt; have left only tiny scraps too little for me to have much interest in taking on. However, I couldn't help but hear echoes of a familiar woo in Adams' words, echoes of a woo-meister so dedicated to arguing that the universe must have "consciousness" that produced human consciousness, that the "randomness" of evolution and biological nature of the brain can never explain consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm referring to Deepak Chopra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I hate to reward the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/last_minute_warning_1.php#comment-328619"&gt;bad behavior&lt;/a&gt; of one of Chopra's "admirers" showing up on this blog. I really do. And linking to the latest bit of Choprawoo, which was brought to my attention by the usual suspect who has periodically infested the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/the_trouble_with_deepak_chopra_part_3.php"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; of my blog ever since I first coined the term "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/the_trouble_with_deepak_chopra_part_3.php"&gt;Choprawoo&lt;/a&gt;" to describe the typical combination of New Age fluff combined with logical fallacies that is the phenomenon known as Deepak Chopra and his persistently annoying brand of woo, would be doing exactly that. (The commenter in question clearly wanted a link from me.)  I also realize that, as &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2006/10/chopra_woo.html"&gt;some have said&lt;/a&gt;, the term "Choprawoo" is redundant, given that almost everything that flows from Chopra's keyboard is nothing but grade A woo. Nonetheless, I like the term and plan on continuing to use it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, after being widely and deservedly smacked down over the absolutely idiotic Choprawoo he spewed about Richard Dawkins, complete with woo about the "consciousness of the universe" creating our consciousness and mischaracterizations of evolution as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/11/wading_through_more_choprawoo.php"&gt;random&lt;/a&gt;. I was tempted to refer my readers back to the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/my_response_to_chopras_latest.php"&gt;only response ever needed to Choprawoo&lt;/a&gt; and leave it at that, but what the heck?

From the Earth, we see a circular bite taken out of the Moon, a dark arc slowly growing, mimicking the crescent Moon shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does it look like from the Moon? Well, if you were standing there, looking around, you’d see it grow darker, the landscape around you enshrouded in shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btu if you looked &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;… you might see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kaguya.jaxa.jp/image/communication/img_090218_01.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/kaguya_lunareclipse.jpg" alt="Lunar eclipse as seen from Kaguya"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kaguya.jaxa.jp/en/communication/com_information_e.htm#NEW_20090218A"&gt;That magnificent sight&lt;/a&gt; is the Sun being eclipsed by the Earth as seen from the Moon. Specifically, it’s taken by the Japanese probe Kaguya as it orbited our own satellite.  How awesome is that? Usually, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Ring_effect_(Solar_Eclipse)"&gt;the diamond ring effect&lt;/a&gt; is seen in a solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks the Sun as seen from Earth. Sunlight peaks around lunar mountains and valleys, creating what looks like a wedding ring in the sky. But not this time: that’s the Earth’s atmosphere lit up, a circle of a sunlight, a ring of a thousand simultaneous sunrises and sunsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it: for tens of thousands of years, humans have watched in awe as the Moon slowly gets eaten by the Earth’s shadow. Over the generations myths have been attributed to it, legends and stories told about the Moon being eaten by dragons and other fanciful tales. Eventually we learned what it really meant (the ancient Greeks knew, those clever people)… but it’s only been in the past few years that we’ve been able to be there when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; that we can turn around, look back home, and see where it all began. Sometimes you have to travel far to understand where your journey began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC's global tech news show &lt;i&gt;Digital Planet&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/click_online/7872316.stm"&gt;reports from Belém in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; on a rootsy version of the new business model that's likely to supersede the traditional music industry. It's musical &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet"&gt;sneakernet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the invention of sound recording, musicians (and to an even greater extent, record companies) have made their money by putting out recordings and controlling who could copy them. In the analog era, this was fairly easy, as sound quality degraded with each successive copy generation. Whoever had the master tape of a hit song easily made money off it. Also, song lyrics and other sleeve notes were hard for pirates to copy and distribute well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is now in an advanced state of collapse because of digital audio and the internet. Why pay for music when you can get it for free over the net? And song lyrics have effectively become free poetry on the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, recording equipment has become cheap enough that any band can have better gear than the Beatles without the involvement of a record company. And music fans are still happy to pay for tickets to live performances. So for the past decade unsigned bands have been doing their best to reach non-paying listeners over the net. If they succeed, they draw a bigger paying crowd at their gigs. That's where the music business is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Belém, apparently there's a large music-loving, party-happy audience that doesn't download music -- most likely because people don't have broadband. Instead they buy cheap pirated CDs in the street. What the city's musicians do, then, instead of uploading mp3 files on the net, is they burn CDs and hand them out to the street vendors to copy. The musicians make no money off of the sales. But they build a reputation that allows them to draw a paying crowd at their gigs -- largely dance-centric sound system affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the lesson is this: illicit copying is not a threat to artists. It is the new distribution system. Recorded music has gone from an exclusive high investment, high returns business to an inclusive low investment, low returns one. Measured in turnover, it has gone from a non-existent business (19th century) to a huge one (20th century) to a rapidly shrinking one (21st century). But no natural law says that a musician or a holder of record-company stock must be able to become insanely rich. Talented musicians aren't driven to make music mainly by the prospect of a jetset lifestyle. And music lovers don't measure the art's vitality in terms of turnover. We look at the amount  of good music being made, and music is alive and well and innovating, thank you very much. The people decrying the ongoing development are record company representatives and musical has-beens who are living off their back catalogue -- not the next generation's Beatles. They're busy putting free mp3s on-line or slipping CDs to their local street pirate and building a following.&lt;br&gt;

Some crank named &lt;a href="http://www.lynden.wednet.edu/district/pubs/board/minutes/July%2026,%202007%20Regular.htm"&gt;Kimberlie Struiksma&lt;/a&gt;, who is apparently associated with education, has proposed to put a remarkably clueless measure onto the ballot. Behold &lt;a href="http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/people.aspx?y=2009"&gt;Initiative Measure No. 1040&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ballot Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Initiative Measure No. 1040 concerns a supreme ruler of the universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This measure would prohibit state use of public money or lands for anything that denies or attempts to refute the existence of a supreme ruler of the universe, including textbooks, instruction or research. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Should this measure be enacted into law? Yes [ ] No [ ]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ballot Measure Summary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This measure would require state government not to use public funds or property for anything that denies or attempts to refute the existence of a supreme ruler of the universe, including but not limited to appropriations for displays, textbooks, scientific endeavors, instruction, and research projects. The measure would provide that no person shall be questioned based on their personal values, beliefs, or opinions regarding the existence of a supreme ruler of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's just the abstract, and if you're a masochist, you can &lt;a href="http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/i1040.pdf"&gt;read the whole thing&lt;/a&gt;; it's long and tedious. You can get the gist of it, though, in a few paragraphs. It's a weird document that tries to explicitly silence atheists and cut off any representation of godlessness, but at the same time flounces about and insists that this isn't discrimination. It's going to exclude atheists from &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respecting no establishment of religion, yet with respect to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, whose existence has been declared in the preamble to the Constitution of the state of Washington, the state shall make no appropriation for nor apply any public moneys or property in support of anything, specifically including, but not limited to, any display, exercise, instruction, textbook, scientific endeavor, circulated document, or research project which denies or attempts to refute the existence of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a clue to the motivation here in the restriction against "any display": I bet this is aimed directly at the people who &lt;i&gt;dared&lt;/i&gt; to put up an atheist sign alongside the Christmas tree at the Washington state capitol this past year. Many people fulminated against that, and here's Ms. Struiksma trying to make it illegal for atheist ideas to be presented, while anyone who endorses a god will not be discriminated against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it gets expanded to cover just about anything that might offend a devout Christian. If you read the definitions, for instance, you discover that one of the targets of the ban, "scientific endeavors", is defined as "any act, idea, theory, intervention, conference, organization, or &lt;i&gt;individual&lt;/i&gt; having to do with science." Apparently, the state cannot support any atheist who is a scientist. There goes a large percentage of the faculty of the University of Washington!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also lots of frantic clauses to assure everyone that this is not a &amp;quot;government sponsored witch hunt&amp;quot; and that it wouldn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;limit or infringe upon religious freedom&amp;quot; — which, of course, simply highlights the fact that that is exactly what it is intended to be and do, and that the author is fully aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't panic yet, Washingtonians! This is only a &lt;i&gt;proposed&lt;/i&gt; initiative. Ms. Struiksma must gather the signatures of 241,153 registered voters by July in order for it to actually be put on the ballot. There aren't that many crazy stupid people in the state, are there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On second thought, maybe you should worry a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking the regional climate-ecology attribution chain in the western United States&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are obviously curious about whether certain current regional environmental changes are traceable to global climate change.  There are a number of large-scale changes that clearly qualify—rapid warming of the arctic/sub-arctic regions for example, and earlier spring onset in the northern hemisphere and the associated phenological changes in plants and animals.  But as one moves to smaller scales of space or time, global-to-local connections become more difficult to establish.  This is due to the combined effect of the resolutions of climate models, the intrinsic variability of the system and the empirical climatic, environmental, or ecological data—the signal to noise ratio of possible causes and observed effects.  Thus recent work by ecologists, climate scientists, and hydrologists in the western United States relating global climate change, regional climate change, and regional ecological change is of great significance. Together, their results show an increasing ability to link the chain at smaller and presumably more viscerally meaningful and politically tractable scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/trees.jpg" align="right"&gt;For instance, a couple of weeks ago, a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5913/447"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in Science by Phil van Mantgem of the USGS, and others, showed that over the last few decades, background levels of tree mortality have been increasing in undisturbed old-growth forests in the western United States, without the accompanying increase in tree “recruitment” (new trees) that would balance the ledger over time. Background mortality is the regular ongoing process of tree death, un-related to the more visible, catastrophic mortality caused by such events as fires, insect attacks, and windstorms, and typically is less than 1% per year.  It is that portion of tree death due to the direct and indirect effects of tree competition, climate (often manifest as water stress), and old age.  Because many things can affect background mortality, van Mantgem et. al. were very careful to minimize the potential for other possible explanatory variables via their selection of study sites, while still maintaining a relatively long record over a wide geographic area.  These other possible causes include, especially, increases in crowding (density; a notorious confounding factor arising from previous disturbances and/or fire suppression), and edge effects (trees close to an&lt;br&gt;
opening experience a generally warmer and drier micro-climate than those in the forest interior).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that in each of three regions, the Pacific Northwest, California, and the Interior West, mortality rates have doubled in 17 to 29 years (depending on location), and have been doing so across all dominant species, all size classes, and all elevations. The authors show with downscaled climate information that the increasing mortality rates likely corresponds to summer soil moisture stress increases over that time that are driven by increases in temperature with little or no change in precipitation in these regions.  Fortunately, natural background mortality rates in western forests are typically less than 0.5% per year, so rate doublings over ~20-30 years, by themselves, will not have large immediate impacts. What the longer term changes will be is an open question however,  depending on future climate and tree recruitment/mortality rates.  Nevertheless, the authors have shown clearly that mortality rates have been increasing over the last ~30 years. Thus the $64,000 question: are these changes attributable in part or all to human-induced global warming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, argues a pair of December papers in the Journal of Climate, and a 2008 work in Science.  The studies, by &lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;amp;doi=10.1175%2F2008JCLI2397.1"&gt;Bonfils et. al. (2008)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tenaya.ucsd.edu/~dettinge/swe_over_p_attribution.pdf"&gt;Pierce et. al. (2008)&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/319/5866/1080"&gt;Barnett et. al. (2008)&lt;/a&gt;, link observed western temperature and temperature-induced snowmelt processes to human-forced (greenhouse gases, ozone, and aerosols) global climate changes.  The authors used various combinations of three GCMs, two statistical downscaling techniques (to account for micro-climate effects that aren&amp;#39;t resolved in the GCMs), and a high resolution hydrology model to experiment with the various possible causes of the observed climatic changes and the robustness of the methods. The possible causes included the usual list of suspects: natural climatic variability, the human-induced forcings just mentioned, and non-human forcings (solar and volcanic).  Climate models were chosen specifically for their ability to account for important, natural climatic fluctuations in the western US that influence temperature, precipitation and snowpack dynamics, particularly the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and El Niño/La Niña oscillations, and/or their ability to generate the daily climatic values necessary for input to the hydrologic model.  The relevant climate variables included various subsets of minimum and maximum daily temperatures from January to March (JFM), their corresponding monthly averages, degree days (days with mean T&amp;gt;0ºC), and the ratio of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) to water year precipitation (P).  In each case, multiple hundred year control runs were generated with two GCMs to isolate the natural variability, and then forced runs from previous model intercomparison projects were used to identify the impacts of the various forcings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results?  The authors estimate that about 50% of the April 1 SWE equivalent, and 60% of river discharge date advances and January-to-March temperature increases, cannot be accounted for by either natural variability or non-human forcings.  Bonfils et al also note that the decreases in SWE are due to January-to-March temperature increases, not winter precipitation decreases, as the observational record over the last several decades shows.  The April snow is a key variable, for along with spring through early fall temperatures, it has a great bearing on growing season soil moisture status throughout the western United States, and thus directly on forest productivity and demographic processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link o’ chain, meet link o’chain.&lt;/p&gt;

It's unique among the specialties for its coverage in the media.  Maybe because we're such social animals, or maybe because such shows about psychiatry or therapy appeal to a voyeuristic impulse in us to peer into people's most private thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our exposure to psychiatry in medical school, however, is primarily with inpatient psychiatry - people who for whatever reason require hospitalization to deal with their mental illnesses.  Reasons may range from soul-crushing anxiety attacks, to addiction, to suicidal ideation, to frank psychosis from schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder.  I'll also say it's very upsetting at first to treat the subset of patients who are being held against their will due to court orders.  One of the most basic tenets of medicine is that a physician must respect the autonomy of their patients, and psychiatric patients have often had a court take this autonomy away from them because of their actions or behavior.  Not surprisingly, many patients are not happy about this. They may not be willing to accept they have a problem, or be very reasonably upset about the financial, social, or legal consequences of a hospital stay, or occasionally they don't necessarily feel that their delusions regarding their absolute dictatorial control of the US government and their need to evade agents of foreign nations by breaking into a pet store are actually a problem.  However, others necessarily are disturbed by such things, often resulting in a temporary detention order, or TDO, to assess their need for psychiatric treatment.   I'm not making light of mental illness, but psychotic states result in behaviors that are frankly bizarre, and the self-reinforcing nature of delusions often put patients into a state that makes them feel you are part of a plot designed to persecute them.  Worse, there are times when a TDO can be devastating to a patient's life.  An inpatient admission for psychiatric, alcohol or drug treatment is not a benign intervention and often has pretty major accompanying legal and social consequences.  Patients are often facing criminal charges for DUIs, violence, or other behavior that has finally come to a head, and cost of treatments is often a huge burden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two major things I learned as a part of this process are that (1) the state of Virginia drastically underfunds the treatment of mental illness relative to other medical illnesses (and this is a very bad thing) and (2) anti-psychotic medications are amazing drugs.  Let's start with a case - details, of necessity, are highly altered due to the sensitivity of psychiatric treatment but the fundamentals are real.  &lt;/p&gt;

This was unexpected, since the post was about the rhetoric of names in political philosophy. In any case, my comments on the comments are too long to fit gracefully in a comment, so I'm posting them here separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rome came up first in  some back-and-forth about the use and meaning of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces"&gt;fasces&lt;/a&gt; in Roman times. Were they  symbols of strength-in-unity, or were they a "portable execution kit"? In support of the second interpretation, Dan Lufkin quoted a passage from a recent book by Cullen Murphy, who in turn cites a 1984 paper by Anthony J. Marshall. Dan &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1154#comment-22681"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that the journal's web site "is still under construction for that issue", and suggests that we can probably find it in the stacks of our campus library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In off-site storage, more likely, but in any case, there's no need to do anything as drastic as actually dealing with a physical object, since Anthony J. Marshall, "&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/page/termsConfirm.jsp?redirectUri=/stable/pdfplus/1088896.pdf"&gt;Symbols and Showmanship in Roman Public Life: The Fasces&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Phoenix&lt;/em&gt; 38(2): 120-141,1984, is available from JSTOR. And Marshall does try to establish the points that Dan Lufkin cites Cullen Murphy as citing it to prove; and his argument seems persuasive to me. Here are a few quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;If we turn from public ceremony to the related topic of state regalia, we find that here also there predominates a tradition of scholarship dedicated to discovering the earliest strata of constitutional history. This limited inquiry may again tempt the unwary to infer that public institutions were static and that consequently their most archaic function continues for all periods to provide the key to the real, abiding significance of regalia such as the fasces. But it would be implausible to equate the primitive origin with the constant &amp;quot;meaning&amp;quot; if the Romans&amp;#39; own perception of their emblems of office remained lively and evolved in response to changing social and political conditions. Nor would it be reasonable to assume that Romans of the later Republic remained generally aware of the earliest, sacral origins of their magisterial regalia. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As constant concomitants of high office both in and outside Rome, the fasces in particular were the most striking visual feature of magisterial authority &amp;quot;on parade,&amp;quot; and it is hardly surprising that our sources do not treat them as modern writers would treat a mere ceremonial mace of office. But this vital element cannot be the concern of studies which approach the evidence with the set purpose of extrapolating abstract constitutional norms. Unless we can establish that a significant number of Romans knew the historic reason for ceremonies such as the removal of axes from fasces at the pomoerium and clearly understood whether the primary significance of the securis was punitive, military, or religious, the traditional discussion of these topics in terms of constitutional technicalities cannot by itself elucidate the complete function of such insignia in post-regal periods. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We may take our start from the basic fact that the fasces were not merely decorative or symbolic devices carried before magistrates in a parade of idle formalism. Rather, they constituted a portable kit for flogging and decapitation. Since they were so brutally functional, they not only served as ceremonial symbols of office but also carried the potential of violent repression and execution. If these emblems of office paraded before Roman eyes retained their practical function in the infliction of severe corporal punishment, then despite the advent of &lt;em&gt;provocatio&lt;/em&gt; their punitive associations never became as historically &amp;quot;distanced&amp;quot; for the average citizen as have those of ceremonial maces and swords in modern societies. Even after provocatio had been won to shield citizens from their summary use, mass executions of deserters or prisoners of war involving virgae and secures could still be viewed on occasion in the forum. Roman society was therefore unusual in that its central magisterial regalia remained directly functional; the fasces continued as both symbol and instrument of executive power. Thus powerful emotions of pride and fear could focus on them, and their symbolic political significance was accordingly intensified by their aura of latent violence. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provocatio_ad_populum"&gt;Provocatio (ad populum)&lt;/a&gt;" was the right of Roman citizens to appeal "to the people" magistrates' decisions in capital cases (also discussed &lt;a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Appellatio.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) According to legend, this right was established by a law passed in the first year of the republic, 509 B.C., after the expulsion of Tarquinius Superbus, the last king of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In this context, it is significant that grants of the &lt;em&gt;ius provocationis&lt;/em&gt; were so highly prized that for some recipients they were an acceptable alternative to full citizenship. Slaves or free men unprotected by citizenship or special privilege were subject without appeal to the full powers of the imperium administered via the lictor's strong right arm. This might run to a few blows to control crowds or enforce respect for the magistrate at an assize-hearing, or it might extend to flogging with or without decapitation to follow. Although the virgae themselves were not intended for capital punishment, the fasces are sometimes termed "bloody" in our sources because of the terrible beating which the heavy rods inflicted; they could, and sometimes did, prove lethal. Of birch or elmwood and some one-and-a- half meters in length, they were considerably weightier than the centurion's vitis or "swagger-stick," (which it was permissible to apply to citizens' backs). The virgae could of course be used on non-Roman military personnel. The single-headed securis, regularly carried in the fasces extra urbem and seen as a component of the regalia of office, was employed for executions under the Republic, later replaced in the Principate by the sword. Condemned prisoners were not kept waiting after sentencing, and execution was carried out in full public view. When the magistrate bade the praeco pronounce the dread words &lt;em&gt;age lege&lt;/em&gt;, the lictors would unstrap the red thongs of the fasces on the spot (&lt;em&gt;virgas expedire&lt;/em&gt;). […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Physical dread of the fasces had abated for the Romans themselves after the cherished right of &lt;em&gt;provocatio&lt;/em&gt; was won. While it remained effective, this right was prized with an ardour intensified by keen awareness of the menacing, practical side of the rods and axe as it continued a reality for the less privileged. Citizens themselves could still be beaten with the virgae if they did not register an appeal, and suspect elements of society such as rowdy actors could still suffer flogging before Roman eyes in the capital. Citizens began once more to dread summary punishment as their right of immunity wore thin from the second century A.D. onward, but in the heyday of their privilege any discovery that citizens' rights had been flouted by the lictors drew sharp reaction. Cicero's Verrines amply demonstrate how easily horrified emotion could be roused by tales of high-handedness. It is reasonable to assume that references to this grimmer side of the fasces and axes are the more emotionally charged because freedom from their application formed such a cherished and central component of civic rights; the more so since they did not fade into obsolescence as instruments of punishment, as have the block, the stocks, and finally the gallows for us. Liability to the fasces, in the chillingly physical image of axe poised over neck, rods over back, could therefore be used as a vivid, even relishable, symbol of subjection to Rome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall also suggests that the modern interpretation of the fasces as symbolizing strength-in-unity, rather than official-violence-provisionally-held-in-check, is an iconographic innovation of the French Revolution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nachleben&lt;/em&gt; of the fasces in post-Classical history cannot be fully documented here but deserves mention as a tribute to their continuing vitality as symbols despite their antiquity. Their association with political strength was to be spectacularly exploited by the French revolutionaries, who interpreted them as a symbol of strength in unity, and, more dubiously, by the Italian Fascisti after 1926.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had learned, or at least retained, only the strength-in-unity interpretation, so I'm grateful to Dan for furthering my education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;The second classical discussion began because I quoted Terence's "humani nihil a me alienum puto", in order to explain why I had read and blogged about Mark Halpern's &lt;em&gt;Language and Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;. In response, Adrian Morgan &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1154#comment-22578"&gt;quoted&lt;/a&gt; an echo in a work by Henri J M Nouwen. I was grateful to learn about Nouwen — I&amp;#39;d never heard of him before — and this confirmed the observations about serendipitous communication an earlier LL post on Terence&amp;#39;s line (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001361.html"&gt;Terence in the global lunchroom&lt;/a&gt;", 8/18/2004).
&lt;p&gt;Terence's line has gotten a lot of attention over the years, as Richard Bauman explains in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RQlNDjUrqtMC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Rights in Ancient Rome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;'Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;'I am a man: I deem nothing pertaining to man foreign to me.' The words of the comic playwright P. Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-second century BC and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later the philosopher Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of mankind with a clarion-call:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are the parts of one great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bids extend our hands to all in need of help. let that well-known line be in our hearts and on our lips: &lt;em&gt;Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;[(myl) from Seneca the Younger (4 BC - 65 AD),  &lt;a href="http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep14-15.shtml"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;With access to an intellectual coterie in which culture, influence and realism all played a part, Terence's message epitomised the Roman conception of human rights. It was not a starry-eyed concept. Prompted by the need to define their relations with non-Romans, the new masters of the Mediterranean world sought to combine the tenets of Greek &lt;em&gt;philanthropia&lt;/em&gt; with traditional Roman values. The resultant product, &lt;em&gt;humanitas&lt;/em&gt;, was given theoretical form by thinkers like Cicero and Seneca, and practical expression by laws and trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what an old hypocrite &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger"&gt;Lucius Annaeus Seneca&lt;/a&gt; was,  it's worth noting that in its original setting in Terence's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22188/22188-h/files/terence3_4.html#tormentor"&gt;Heautontimorumenos: The Self-Tormenter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the line is a contextually ironic justification of neighborly meddling, rather than an unambiguous affirmation of universal empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry Thomas Riley's version of the play's "argument" begins like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Chremes commands his wife, when pregnant, if she is delivered of a girl immediately to kill the child. Having given birth to a girl, Sostrata delivers her to an old woman named Philtera to be exposed. Instead of doing this, Philtera calls her Antiphila, and brings her up as her own. Clinia, the son of Menedemus, falls in love with her, and treats her as though his wife. Menedemus, on learning this, is very angry, and by his harsh language drives away his son from home. Taking this to heart, and in order to punish himself for his ill-timed severity, Menedemus, though now an aged man, fatigues himself by laboring at agricultural pursuits from morning till night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sets the stage for Riley's translation of the start of Act 1, Scene 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chremes: &lt;/strong&gt;Although this acquaintanceship between us is of  very recent date, from the time in fact of your purchasing an estate  here in the neighborhood, yet either your good qualities, or our being  neighbors (which I take to be a sort of friendship), induces me to  inform you, frankly and familiarly, that you appear to me to labor  beyond your years, and beyond what your affairs require. For, in the  name of Gods and men, what would you have? What can be your aim? You  are, as I conjecture, sixty years of age, or more. No man in these  parts has a better or a more valuable estate, no one more servants; and  yet you discharge their duties just as diligently as if there were none  at all. However early in the morning I go out, and however late in the  evening I return home, I see you either digging, or plowing, or doing  something, in fact, in the fields. You take respite not an instant, and  are quite regardless of yourself. I am very sure that this is not done  for your amusement. But really I am vexed how little work is done here. If you were to employ the time you spend in laboring yourself, in keeping your servants at work, you would profit much more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menedemius:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you so much leisure, Chremes, from your own affairs, that you can attend to those of others-those which don't concern you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chremes:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a man, and nothing that concerns a man do I deem a matter of indifference to  me.  Suppose that I wish either to advise you in this matter, or to be  informed myself:  if what you do is right, that I may do the same; if it  is not, then that I may dissuade you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menedemius: &lt;/strong&gt;It's requisite for me to do so; do you as it is necessary for you to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chremes:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it requisite for any person to torment himself?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menedemius: &lt;/strong&gt;It is for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chremes: &lt;/strong&gt;If you have any affliction, I could wish it otherwise. But prithee, what sorrow is this of yours? How have you deserved so ill of yourself?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menedemius: &lt;/strong&gt;Alas! alas! (He begins to weep.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key section in the original Latin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ME.&lt;/strong&gt; Chreme, tantumne ab re tuast oti tibi&lt;br&gt;
aliena ut cures ea quae nil ad te attinent?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CH.&lt;/strong&gt; homo sum: humani nil a me alienum puto.&lt;br&gt;
vel me monere hoc vel percontari puta:&lt;br&gt;
rectumst ego ut faciam; non est te ut deterream.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ME.&lt;/strong&gt; mihi sic est usu'; tibi ut opu' factost face.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CH.&lt;/strong&gt; an quoiquamst usus homini se ut cruciet? &lt;strong&gt;ME.&lt;/strong&gt; mihi.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CH.&lt;/strong&gt; si quid laborist nollem. sed quid istuc malist?&lt;br&gt;
quaeso, quid de te tantum meruisti? &lt;strong&gt;ME.&lt;/strong&gt; eheu!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe now science will truly regain its rightful place and we’ll end the CAM, ‘me-too’ drug, and excessive-use-of-technology madness that is wasting so much money in healthcare.” In fact, I was so excited about the new administration’s apparent interest in objective analysis of medical treatment options, that I intended to write a jubilant blog post about it. However, as with most things that seem black and white at first glance, further analysis reduces them to shades of gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Comparative Clinical Effectiveness Research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new economic stimulus bill, also known as The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) includes 1.1 billion dollars for clinical comparative effectiveness research. Interestingly, CCER is not defined in the bill though AHRQ describes it this way in their &lt;a href="http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/tools.cfm?tooltype=glossary&amp;amp;TermID=118"&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A type of health care research that compares the results of one approach for managing a disease to the results of other approaches. Comparative effectiveness usually compares two or more types of treatment, such as different drugs, for the same disease. Comparative effectiveness also can compare types of surgery or other kinds of medical procedures and tests. The results often are summarized in a systematic review.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any mention of “comparative cost effectiveness” or value-based language is notably absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does It Work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government’s new CCER initiative will be administered through a Federal Coordinating Council for clinical comparative effectiveness research. The FCC consists of a group of 15 federal employees, half of whom “must be physicians or other experts with clinical expertise.” [Meaning, none have to be physicians.] Some have suggested that the FCC is the first step toward an organization modeled after Britain’s &lt;a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/"&gt;National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence&lt;/a&gt; (NICE). NICE is regularly tasked with helping the NHS to decide which medical treatments should be available to their beneficiaries, and which should not be covered (based on their efficacy and cost).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for the CCER will be divvied up as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;400 million – left to the discretion of the Secretary of HHS with 1.5 million to go to the Institute of Medicine for a report regarding where to focus CCER attention initially&lt;br&gt;
400 million – to the office of the director, NIH&lt;br&gt;
300 million - to AHRQ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1/text"&gt;quote from the ARRA bill&lt;/a&gt;, discussing the mechanics of CCER:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The funding appropriated in this paragraph shall be used to accelerate the development and dissemination of research assessing the comparative clinical effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies, including through efforts that: (1) conduct, support, or synthesize research that compares the clinical outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of items, services, and procedures that are used to prevent, diagnose, or treat diseases, disorders, and other health conditions and (2) encourage the development and use of clinical registries, clinical data networks, and other forms of electronic health data that can be used to generate or obtain outcomes data: Provided further, That the Secretary shall enter into a contract with the Institute of Medicine, for which no more than $1,500,000 shall be made available from funds provided in this paragraph, to produce and submit a report to the Congress and the Secretary by not later than June 30, 2009 that includes recommendations on the national priorities for comparative clinical effectiveness research to be conducted or supported with the funds provided in this paragraph…”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Game-Changer For Pharma, Medical Technology, and Biotech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that CCER stands to radically change how industry does business. I anticipate that industry will develop their own internal CCER teams, and begin the process of comparing their new product (to others currently available) as early as phase 3 clinical trials. By and large, that’s probably a good thing – though there are potential unintended consequences that deserve mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s appropriate for drug, device, and equipment manufacturers to consider whether or not their new product actually contributes something new/better to our current cadre of treatment options, there will be clear winners and losers in this game. And when companies lose, we lose companies. That’s generally not good for the economy. Manufacturers without diversified product lines are more likely to go out of business – and it will become more difficult for new players to enter the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although comparative &lt;em&gt;clinical&lt;/em&gt; effectiveness research is distinct from comparative&lt;em&gt; cost&lt;/em&gt; effectiveness research – it is likely that payers will use CCER to build their formularies. This means that even though the government (at this point in time) is not mandating coverage decisions based on CCER, health insurers are going to be using the information liberally to justify coverage preferences and even potential denials of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the question of stifling innovation. Blockbuster drugs are rarely discovered in a vacuum. They are the result of incremental steps in understanding the biology of disease, with an ever improving ability to target the offending pathophysiologic process. The first few therapies may offer marginally improved outcomes, but can lead to discoveries that substantially improve their efficacy. If an early drug is found to be only marginally better than the standard of care, an unfavorable comparative effectiveness rating could kill the drug’s sale. Without sales to recoup the R&amp;amp;D losses and reinvestment in the next generation of the drug, development may cease for financial reasons, and the breakthrough drug that could cure patients would never exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Rich argues in his &lt;a href="http://covertrationingblog.com/"&gt;excellent blog&lt;/a&gt;: healthcare rationing is inevitable – but it’s more ethical to do it overtly than covertly. I would also like to suggest that insofar as physicians can be enlisted to translate CCER for patients (rather than being handed down inflexible rules from on high) and help them make the best decision for them – that would be even better. The inflexibility of national decisions about healthcare rationing does make me nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Good For The Geese Isn’t Necessarily Good For The Goose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, most key healthcare stakeholders would like to be able to compare efficacy of one treatment option over another. Informed decision-making is hard to do when head-to-head studies are simply not available for most treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, population-based conclusions do not always provide a clear “best choice” for individual patients. Individual genetic differences, allergy profiles, complicated drug regimens, unique constellations of diseases, socioeconomic factors, and psychological issues all influence clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nancy Nielsen recently &lt;a href="http://blog.getbetterhealth.com/ama-president-dr-nancy-nielsen-at-the-medicare-policy-summit/2009.02.12"&gt;voiced concern&lt;/a&gt; about CCER at the Medicare Policy Summit. She said that the AMA’s position is that CCER is for information purposes, not for coverage decisions. CCER’s goal is to help patients make informed choices, not limit their choices. I’m afraid the horse may have already left the barn on that one – but I agree with Dr. Nielsen’s sentiment. It would be wonderful if CCER could remain in its supportive role for shared physician-patient informed decision-making. My fervent wish is that in doing the right thing by the geese, we don’t kill off the occasional goose. Physicians need the flexibility to make exceptions when necessary for their patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Republican Unrest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A certain degree of hysteria related to CCER has recently wafted up through the hallowed halls of government. Are republicans overreacting to the bill? Maybe – though the bill doesn’t include any provisions for using CCER to mandate coverage decisions or ration care, it seems that Pete Stark has made it clear that he’d like the FCC to “direct medicine” which does kind of send a shiver down my physician spine, and provides some insight into what some democrats are hoping to accomplish with CCER - laying the foundation for future government involvement in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;a href="http://www.thegraysheet.com/nr/FDC/SupportingDocs/gray/2009/012609_House_stimulus_report.pdf"&gt;one particular congressional report&lt;/a&gt; is proving helpful in “reading the tea leaves” regarding the democrats’ plan for CCER. In describing the comparative effectiveness provision, the report states that items, procedures, and interventions “that are found to be less effective and in some cases, more expensive, will no longer be prescribed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While congressional reports are not binding, they do give an &lt;a href="http://www.medicaldevicestoday.com/2009/01/comparative-effectiveness-language-in-stimulus-bill-raises-concerns-.html"&gt;indication of intent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that though CCER is not supposed to be used for “cost effectiveness” decisions – there’s no policy in place to protect that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information about the comparative clinical effectiveness of treatment options is critical for the practice of evidence based medicine. Such information supports informed decision-making, and could be the single most important strategy for reducing the use of wasteful or ineffective therapies in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, CCER will certainly have some negative consequences, both anticipated and unanticipated. When “cost effectiveness” conclusions are drawn from clinical effectiveness data, rationing ensues, patient choices are limited, people lose their jobs, and some companies go out of business. As a recent article in the &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/359/19/1977"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine points out&lt;/a&gt;, “saying no isn’t nice.” I greet this 1.1 billion dollar initiative with muted enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post Script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my research for this blog post I came across some interesting quotes. I thought I’d add them here for your consideration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And before you tell me we need such bills in order to be more scientific, take a minute and ask yourself just how scientific you think the government will be when it applies cost-cutting measures to medicine.  The congress is certainly a hot-bed of evidence-based legislation, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://edwinleap.com/blog/?p=299"&gt;- Edwin Leap, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When things go wrong, which of course they will, we reach for 2 tools to try to fix them: rules, and incentives. We see this at work in our response to the current financial crisis – but the truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we turn increasingly to rules and incentives, they may make things better in the short run but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run. Moral skill is chipped away by an over reliance on rules that deprive us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations, and moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without intending it, by appealing to rules and incentives we are engaging in a war on wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, we need rules. Most Jazz musicians need some notes on the page, and we need more rules for the bankers, God knows. But too many rules prevent jazz musicians from improvising and as a result, they lose their gifts – or worse, they stop playing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need incentives - people have to make a living. But over-reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity. It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale, and it causes the activity itself to lose morality.&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly, the education that Charlie is getting in said town deep in Jersey suburbia is very much worth any inconveniences. The greatest inconvenience (if that's the right word) of all is not to have the right kind of school program for Charlie, and he has that now. For the first part of the school year, there were some issues with the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/left_behind_on_the_bus"&gt;schoolbus&lt;/a&gt;; since last month, there's been a new driver who shrugs and nods when Charlie's taking an extra couple of minutes to get out the door in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this is the case where you live, but Jim and I have found that school districts in towns that are not exactly the most liberal have tended to have better programs for special education students in general and for autism in particular. And so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always make sure that Charlie gets some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_couch_potatoes_here"&gt;good exercise&lt;/a&gt; every day, rain or shine. A couple of times a week, Charlie and I take a long walk up and down the main boulevard of our condo complex. There's usually a couple of power walkers; there's no dogs (no pets allowed in this complex). Monday evening Charlie and I did the walk in good time---he has been enjoying running up hills and down hills lately; perhaps the cold is a motivator. After we had gotten back home, I suggested we get a backpack and walk to the grocery store for a few things. I wasn't sure if Charlie would say yes to more walking, but he immediately said "backpack" and returned from his room with the really beat-up lime green LLBean backpack that he's had for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off we went: It's less than ten minutes to a (maybe secret) back entrance to the nearby shopping mall. Charlie knows exactly how to get there, down to the run up and over a grassy knoll beside a big ol' garbage dumpster. Soon we were in the aisles of a semi-gigantic chain grocery store that could, if you were willing to wear Giants t-shirts and mesh gym shorts and sleep and eat off of lawn furniture, provide a human being with most of life's essentials. (And that's not mentioning the rack of gift cards to every conceivable chain restaurant in New Jersey.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie, as is his habit, checked out the entire bakery section before getting what he usually gets, a six-pack of cupcakes. We stopped for watermelon and bananas and lettuce in the produce section, got a couple of items from the &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-shirt-says-it-all/"&gt;condiment&lt;/a&gt; section (while we were there, Jim called me about some things but Charlie did not select the largest possible bottle of ketchup, but the mid-sized one), and then had to check out the (yes, gleaming) cases of frozen food (where Charlie glanced at the mammoth bags of fries and walked away when I said, I didn't think so). Most of the groceries fit into the backpack, which Charlie pulled on easily, and homeward bound we were, under the stars. (I packed the ketchup and pickles in my bag.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, we were the only customers who left on our own two feet and with groceries in our own bags (how green can we get?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I may carp about the town but one can only complain so much---you've got to make the most of what you've been given.  Trust me, sushi (forgotten to mention that above---as if Charlie could leave a grocery store without his favorite!) and even cupcakes taste better when you've hauled them home on your own back.&lt;/p&gt;

She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging, and even if I did my wife needs me more. Because I foresaw this coming, however, I do have a series of "Best of" reposts lined up. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks. Right now I just don't know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While thinking about ways to make the blog better, I wondered if I should emulate some of my colleagues, many of whom have regular features every week, often on Friday. And, since I usually get a little less serious on Fridays anyway (and, because traffic seems to fall off 50% or more anyway regardless of what I post, on the weekends, too), it seemed like a good idea. But I couldn't think of something that ties together the common themes of this blog, yet maintains a suitably Friday-blogging light-hearted feel to it. And then I came across this article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&amp;amp;ProduktNr=224242&amp;amp;Ausgabe=231815&amp;amp;ArtikelNr=93662"&gt;L. R. Milgrom (2006). Towards a New Model of the Homeopathic Process Based on Quantum Field Theory. &lt;em&gt;Forsch Komplementärmed&lt;/em&gt; 2006;13:174-183.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Forsch Komplementärmed&lt;/em&gt;, apparently, means &lt;em&gt;Research in Complementary Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, the journal's English title.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, joy! I had my idea: Your Friday Dose of Woo! (And what better way to start off the long 4th of July weekend here in the states than with a bit of woo?) Not only did I have my idea, but I had my first topic.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004532" title=""&gt;Estimating Mass Properties of Dinosaurs Using Laser Imaging and 3D Computer Modelling&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Body mass reconstructions of extinct vertebrates are most robust when complete to near-complete skeletons allow the reconstruction of either physical or digital models. Digital models are most efficient in terms of time and cost, and provide the facility to infinitely modify model properties non-destructively, such that sensitivity analyses can be conducted to quantify the effect of the many unknown parameters involved in reconstructions of extinct animals. In this study we use laser scanning (LiDAR) and computer modelling methods to create a range of 3D mass models of five specimens of non-avian dinosaur; two near-complete specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex, the most complete specimens of Acrocanthosaurus atokensis and Strutiomimum sedens, and a near-complete skeleton of a sub-adult Edmontosaurus annectens. LiDAR scanning allows a full mounted skeleton to be imaged resulting in a detailed 3D model in which each bone retains its spatial position and articulation. This provides a high resolution skeletal framework around which the body cavity and internal organs such as lungs and air sacs can be reconstructed. This has allowed calculation of body segment masses, centres of mass and moments or inertia for each animal. However, any soft tissue reconstruction of an extinct taxon inevitably represents a best estimate model with an unknown level of accuracy. We have therefore conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis in which the volumes of body segments and respiratory organs were varied in an attempt to constrain the likely maximum plausible range of mass parameters for each animal. Our results provide wide ranges in actual mass and inertial values, emphasizing the high level of uncertainty inevitable in such reconstructions. However, our sensitivity analysis consistently places the centre of mass well below and in front of hip joint in each animal, regardless of the chosen combination of body and respiratory structure volumes. These results emphasize that future biomechanical assessments of extinct taxa should be preceded by a detailed investigation of the plausible range of mass properties, in which sensitivity analyses are used to identify a suite of possible values to be tested as inputs in analytical models.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004522" title=""&gt;Avian Incubation Inhibits Growth and Diversification of Bacterial Assemblages on Eggs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Microbial infection is a critical source of mortality for early life stages of oviparous vertebrates, but parental defenses against infection are less well known. Avian incubation has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of trans-shell infection by limiting microbial growth of pathogenic bacteria on eggshells, while enhancing growth of commensal or beneficial bacteria that inhibit or competitively exclude pathogens. We tested this hypothesis by comparing bacterial assemblages on naturally incubated and experimentally unincubated eggs at laying and late incubation using a universal 16S rRNA microarray containing probes for over 8000 bacterial taxa. Before treatment, bacterial assemblages on individual eggs from both treatment groups were dissimilar to one another, as measured by clustering in non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination space. After treatment, assemblages of unincubated eggs were similar to one another, but those of incubated eggs were not. Furthermore, assemblages of unincubated eggs were characterized by high abundance of six indicator species while incubated eggs had no indicator species. Bacterial taxon richness remained static on incubated eggs, but increased significantly on unincubated eggs, especially in several families of Gram-negative bacteria. The relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa did not change on incubated eggs, but that of 82 bacterial taxa, including some known to infect the interior of eggs, increased on unincubated eggs. Thus, incubation inhibits all of the relatively few bacteria that grow on eggshells, and does not appear to promote growth of any bacteria.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_125.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/epEXEyT8jQ4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235024862273"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2256">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/703966b9e8202092</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Future Technology"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Robots"/><title type="html">Robot playmates for autistic kids</title><published>2009-02-19T06:22:05Z</published><updated>2009-02-19T06:22:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/robot-playmates-for-autistic-kids/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:v4v0qReFcFYt8M:http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/rosie.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:v4v0qReFcFYt8M:http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/rosie.jpg" alt="" width="93" height="140"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Autistic kids love robots as much as anyone else. So why not &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090217141544.htm"&gt;have robots help children with autism learn the social skills&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of research going on around the world today trying to use robots to treat children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It has shown that the children are attracted to robots, raising the promise that appropriately designed robots could play an important role in their treatment,” says Nilanjan Sarkar, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Vanderbilt University. “However, the efforts so far have been quite limited because they haven’t had a way to monitor the emotional state of the children, which would allow the robot to respond automatically to their reactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I wouldn’t mind having a robotic playmate of my own, but I’m thinking about a different kind of playmate altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of his recent papers, published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (57:1), Rui Hai Liu, Cornell associate professor of food science and a member of Cornell’s Institute for Comparative and Environmental Toxicology, reports that fresh apple extracts significantly inhibited the size of mammary tumors in rats — and the more extracts they were given, the greater the inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We not only observed that the treated animals had fewer tumors, but the tumors were smaller, less malignant and grew more slowly compared with the tumors in the untreated rats,” said Liu, pointing out that the study confirmed the findings of his preliminary study in rats published in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now a representative in Arkansas has submitted a &lt;a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2009/R/Pages/BillInformation.aspx?measureno=HJR1009"&gt;bill to amend the Arkansas constitution and remove the prohibition of atheists&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course who knows whether this bill will survive but it’s at least good to see someone in government fighting such primative and bigoted laws.&lt;/p&gt;

Who could have predicted this incredible breakthrough? I especially like the seemingly unintentional double ententre of this quote from the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans revealed that when men are shown pictures of scantily clad women, the region of the &lt;a href="http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/health-and-human-body/human-body/brain-article.html"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; associated with tool use lights up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexy women in bikinis apparently inspire some men to see them as objects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a “shocking” finding, Fiske noted, some of the men studied showed no activity in the part of the brain that usually responds when a person ponders another’s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that these men see women “as sexually inviting, but they are not thinking about their minds,” Fiske said. “The lack of activation in this social cognition area is really odd, because it hardly ever happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just a small study that involved 21 hetersexual men, who were asked to first take a test to determine different types of sexist attitudes. They were then shown pictures of both scantily clad and fully dressed men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the men best remembered headless photographs of women in bikinis, even if they’d only seen the image for two-tenths of a second, Fiske reported this weekend in Chicago during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the men who scored higher as “hostile sexists”—those who view women as controlling and invaders of male space—didn’t show brain activity that indicates they saw the women in bikinis as humans with thoughts and intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;What’s really amazing though is that not a single REAL doctor is interviewed in the article and the closest the writer came to a skeptical opinion was from a professor in the department of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;complementary “medicine” at the University of Exeter, who said:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;“There is no evidence for its efficacy. It has not been submitted to clinical trials, but there have certainly been satisfied customers for 3,000 years.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:x-small"&gt;Of course he forgot to mention that every single “treatment” taught in his department is equally lacking in good evidence and haven’t passed proper peer-reviewed clinical trials.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was “harder than &lt;a href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/Pregnancy_and_Childbirth"&gt;labor&lt;/a&gt;” telling her parents she was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, we were sitting on the couch, my best friend and Levi, and we had my parents come and sit on the couch, too. And we had my sisters go upstairs,” &lt;a href="http://topics.cnn.com/topics/bristol_palin"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; said. “And we just sat them down, and I just — I couldn’t even say it. I was just sick to my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And so finally, my best friend just, like, blurted it out. And it was just, like — I don’t even remember it because it was just, like, something I don’t want to remember.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also suggested she wishes she’d have waited 10 years before having a baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found two small pieces matching a description of meteorites (they had a blackened surface, called a &lt;em&gt;fusion crust&lt;/em&gt;) in a town called West, between Waco and Dallas, which looks to be right along the fireball’s path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this pans out it will be very exiting! With all the eyewitnesses and the video, a good orbit for this object may be backtracked. And now, if this pans out, we’ll have samples that can be examined chemically to determine the fireball’s composition! It’s the next best thing to going to an asteroid itself, so this is could turn out to be a major boon for astronomers who study asteroids and meteorites both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not only that, this thing that came in was probably a meter or so across, which means larger chunks might be out there, just waiting to be found. I hope some folks in that area go looking!&lt;/p&gt;

As usual, I’ll voice my dissenting opinion and say that Hulu is doing the right thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boxee, for those who don’t know, is a service that aggregates certain video from all around the web into one media center-like experience. It’s sort of like having a TiVo that has (at least until Friday) unlimited access to lots of top quality content, and minus all the useless crap that comprises the majority of content on other video sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content owners, like Hulu, generally found this less objectionable (or so the theory went) than simply stealing the content, since Boxee preserved any advertisements within it. It acted more like an RSS reader than the good old pirate-laden days of YouTube.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to pass Hulu’s request off as old media dinosaurs not understanding new technology, but Hulu itself (a joint venture between two of them) seems to disprove that. That site is a damn near perfect mixture of old media and new delivery methods. If NBC and especially Fox seem to get it, and if they are objecting, there’s a reason. They must fear something happening if services like Boxee are allowed to grow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few obvious disadvantages to Boxee for Hulu. They lose the ability to run display ads alongside content, which they don’t seem to do yet anyway, but may one day. And, perhaps more importantly, they lose the ability to track people around the web using standard browser cookies (which presumably don’t work on Boxee since it isn’t in a browser) which can be used to target ads and increase revenue rates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of that still might not be enough for them to feel the need to pull the plug. My theory is that they fear Boxee growing large and offering an end-run around the networks for content producers. They’re already pissed that YouTube got as big as it did, almost entirely due to their content, but YouTube is at least too mired in music videos  and losers screaming “Leave Britney alone!” into webcams to pose a serious threat to the networks. They’re just not where you turn for high quality content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so with Boxee, they’re playing Facebook to YouTube’s MySpace. They’re building the endless TiVo, with dozens of hand-picked, high-quality channels, and one they plan on integrating with existing hardware like televisions and DVRs and gaming consoles. They will, if they’re successful, deliver professionally-produced content to millions of people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the networks’ standpoint, that’s not a good thing. It shifts the balance of power. Currently if a Hollywood producer decides to make a television show, he’s got only a few major networks and a handful of cable ones (most of which are owned by the same companies as the majors) to shop it around to. Put Boxee in a few successful TVs and DVRs, and you’ve got a viable new network right there. Put them in 100 million homes and computers and you’ve got a monster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networks are nothing more than a middleman between the people who make content and the ones who consume it, and they know it. And like all middlemen, they lie awake at night hoping the people on the ends don’t find a way to cut them out. The relatively slow bandwidth in most of the first world and the lack, until recently, of internet-connected hardware attached to televisions has relegated online video to little more than kittens on treadmills, but the writing is on the wall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu is the networks’ best chance to keep control of the middle ground, and Boxee is a direct threat to that. Their streaming hundreds of thousands of Hulu videos per week seems like a gift right now, but it’s a Trojan horse and the networks know it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect we’ll be seeing a lot more from Hulu in the future. They’ll be in all of the same places Boxee wants to end up. In your TV, on your Wii and iPhone. Removing their content from Boxee is the first salvo in the battle to retain control of the middle ground, and one they have to win to ensure their survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235009473785"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-3151474839907885152">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4eee261f8d291d09</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">McLean's on Canadian science.</title><published>2009-02-19T01:31:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-19T01:59:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/rD_4vEiwndY/mcleans-on-canadian-science.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=3151474839907885152" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/mcleans-on-canadian-science.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">On the McLean's blog, &lt;a href="http://blog.macleans.ca/2009/02/17/a-friendly-note-to-canadas-science-researchers-um/"&gt;Paul Wells&lt;/a&gt; asks whether the anecdotes of hard times for Canadian scientists reported in the &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/01/more-on-disaster-in-canadian-science.html"&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/a&gt; are indicative of broader problems.  Specifically, he writes,&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s my problem: why has nobody in the research community been able to &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that this is the case? With something more persuasive than anecdotes, I mean. The only problem with the Globe story is that it uses “researchers,” plural, in the headline, when in fact it’s just another anecdote about some guy who had a sweeter offer in Singapore than he did at home. Maybe the guy in the next lab is here in Canada because Singapore was chintzing him out and it all balances out in the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I’m wondering is when Canada’s researchers, who depend in many cases on tax dollars for their work, are going to do some &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt; about the distribution of those tax dollars. I asked a director of research at one of Canada’s most prominent institutions whether there’s any objective measure of research capacity vs. granting flow that would &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; the kind of mismatch today’s article hints at. He said he’s not aware of any. Well, that’s a problem, isn’t it? If our national science apparatus is overbuilt and underfuelled, rebalancing becomes crucial. But if the only people who think it is are researchers, and they can’t get their act together to prove their point, nobody will listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are good questions.  I tend to agree that we (Canadian scientists) need to be much more vocal in communicating our successes and our challenges to taxpayers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a start, I can point out the following items:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) An analysis of the relative support for and productivity of Canadian researchers has been discussed in scientific publications, such as &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n6997/full/430311a.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Nature article.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The problem of a "brain drain" was one of the reasons the Canada Research Chair program, the CFI, and Genome Canada were developed.  Despite some problems, this seems to have worked -- quite a number of top rank researchers have relocated to Canada and many more have stayed.  It follows that cutting support for some of these programs may have the reverse effect.  In fact, just the perception of uncertaintly in terms of funding can make it unappealing for someone to move here and start a program.  The journal Nature discussed the state of Canadian science &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7181/full/451866a.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090204/full/457646a.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;3) It is well recognized that Canadian scientists are not as well funded as American colleagues.  Individual grants tend to be much smaller and there are fewer options for support.  The big problem, which will affect everyone, is that the recent budget includes cuts to NSERC and CIHR.  With this, it will be very difficult to pay for students and operating expenses.  One can invest in infrastructure (e.g., with CFI), but that doesn't pay for people to do actual studies.&lt;p&gt;4) The government is increasingly exerting an influence on what kinds of research are funded, with a specific focus on applied areas such as energy, fisheries, aquaculture, etc.  This is at the expense of basic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5) There has been a shift to funding very large student scholarships ($50K/yr, which is twice the average starting grant for some panels in NSERC).  Most of us find this completely inexplicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-3151474839907885152.gif?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/rD_4vEiwndY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1235006461338"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/18/more-reviews-of-death/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/70c61c60fb143b2d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><title type="html">More reviews of DEATH!</title><published>2009-02-18T21:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T21:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/18/more-reviews-of-death/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been slacking in my linking to reviews of my book &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt;, for the two of you who haven’t been inundated with my onslaught of self-promotional posts.

&lt;p&gt;I’m the eldest of three children. When I was about 11, I found out that I was autistic, by reading books about autism in children. We had those books because my parents were trying to find out what was going on with my youngest brother, who was having a lot of problems in school (and elsewhere). Back then (the 80’s and early 90’s), no one seemed that concerned: unless the problems were immense, people expected everything would turn out fine as you grew up. When I told my mother that I thought I was autistic, she agreed. I did not have a formal diagnosis, and no one saw a reason to pursue one. That changed later on, and I received a diagnosis of Asperger’s at 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diagnosis was sought, after all that time, because of the problems I had been and still am encountering. They are the kind of problems that cannot be solved by growing older. I have always had them, but because of being a child and certain decisions my parents made for me (such as which school I would attend, enrolling me in judo and swimming lessons) and our general lifestyle (geared towards autistics, since there are so many of them in our family, despite the lack of diagnoses), they were never very noticeable. When I was no longer living in that ‘system’, the problems suddenly became blatantly obvious. I’ll discuss one of them in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became apparent that I am, as they say, unable to live independently. It’s strange how something that seems so big and obvious, can go completely unnoticed. I also have a lot of trouble finding and keeping work. The state has even deemed me 100% unable to work. As I said in the previous post, I’ll elaborate a bit on the housing situation in my country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am living with my long-time partner in a rental apartment, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing"&gt;social housing&lt;/a&gt;. In general, there is somewhat of a housing crisis going on in the Netherlands. Buying a house costs quite a lot, and if you do not make enough money to receive an adequate loan to buy, or rent expensive housing (also has income requirements), the waiting lists for social housing are… sickening. It can actually be easier to find a place to live if you are autistic (or ‘special’ in another way). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some possibilities for autistic people: Group homes (‘zorgboerderijen’ and other such places) are an option, but are falling out of favour (in my opinion, rightfully so). Right now, parent- or autistic-initiated projects (more often parent-initiated) are most popular. Projects where a group of houses in the same street, or a group of apartments in the same building, are found (and sometimes built especially), for occupation by (usually) one autistic per house/apartment, of any functioning level (for lack of a better term, and usually a project will look for people who are more or less in the same ‘range’). Staff have an office or building next door, and will do as much or as little as required (both help inside the house, and outside). Rent is paid for by the inhabitants’ job or disability income. Staff is paid for by &lt;a href="http://www.pgb.nl/showpage.php?pa=234"&gt;PGB&lt;/a&gt;, unless one has relatives with a boatload of money, who happen to be willing to pay for it themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this an attractive option: living ‘on your own’ in a regular town and neighbourhood, but also having people quite a lot like yourself right next door. All (ideally) accommodations taken care of.&lt;br&gt;
These projects are not for me, though. If you have a partner and want to live together, you’re not eligible for a place in such a project. But even if you were: if you live with a partner, you receive no help inside of the house at all unless you can pay for it yourself (unlikely). And the help you can receive outside of the house is often lacking and hard to find. No one seems to have realised yet that autistic people can have partners and live with them. Or they think that if they do, they must not need any services and accommodations. They seem to think that if you have a partner, this partner can do a full-time job, function as your ‘staff’, and do the entire household, on their own. We’ve lived this situation for some years now, and believe me, it’s hell on your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government thinks my biggest problem is work. I say it is housing. The accommodations to help someone work seem far less complicated to implement. Besides: as long as my housing situation is too far below optimal, my work situation will suffer from that too. Better to first solve the more central issue.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>v.d.

These laws are archaic and unenforceable in principle — they were all ruled unconstitutional in 1961 — but of course they&amp;#39;re still in effect across all 50 states in practice, since public opinion makes it almost impossible for an atheist to get elected to high office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, though, a representative in Arkansas has submitted a &lt;a href="http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2009/R/Pages/BillInformation.aspx?measureno=HJR1009"&gt;bill to amend the Arkansas constitution and remove the prohibition of atheists&lt;/a&gt;. This could get very interesting, or it might not. If the Arkansas legislature does the sensible thing and simply and efficiently removes an old law that can't be enforced anyway, I will be pleased, but there won't be much drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since when are legislatures sensible, however? I can imagine indignant Christians defending an unconstitutional law and insisting that it be kept on the books as a token of their contempt. It is an awkward situation for the Christianist yahoos, because their constituencies might get inflamed, but on other hand, do they really want to go on record defending the indefensible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to it, and kudos to Rep. Richard Carroll of North Little Rock for &lt;a href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/undergod/2009/02/an_advocate_for_atheists_in_ar.html"&gt;poking a stick into this nest of snakes and stirring it up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/arkansas_might_let_atheists_ru.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/VUbG7gqEItk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234994495764"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317659032924518627.post-7447590903878716655">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3f486df0b7816ac3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Call for Submissions: Citation Classics</title><published>2009-02-18T21:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T21:41:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/2009/02/call-for-submissions-citation-classics.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/" type="html">I will be hosting the next edition of The Giant's Shoulders here at The Evilutionary Biologist.

Here's what they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Professor Gotelli,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw your op-ed in the Burlington Free Press and appreciated your support
of free speech at UVM. In light of that, I wonder if you would be open to
finding a way to provide a campus forum for a debate about evolutionary
science and intelligent design. The Discovery Institute, where I   
work, has a
local sponsor in Burlington who is enthusiastic to find a way to make this
happen. But we need a partner on campus. If not the biology   
department, then
perhaps you can suggest an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Stein may not be the best person to single-handedly represent the ID
side. As you're aware, he's known mainly as an entertainer. A more
appropriate alternative or addition might be our senior fellows David
Berlinski or Stephen Meyer, respectively a mathematician and a philosopher
of science. I'll copy links to their bios below. Wherever one comes down in
the Darwin debate, I think we can all agree that it is healthy for students
to be exposed to different views--in precisely the spirit of inviting
controversial speakers to campus, as you write in your op-ed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping that you would be willing to give a critique of ID at such an
event, and participate in the debate in whatever role you feel comfortable
with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good scientific backdrop to the discussion might be Dr. Meyer's book that
comes out in June from HarperCollins, "Signature in the Cell: DNA and the
Evidence for Intelligent Design."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Dr. Belinski may be a good choice since he is a  
critic of
both ID and Darwinian theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible for us to talk more about this by phone sometime soon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With best wishes,&lt;br&gt;
David Klinghoffer&lt;br&gt;
Discovery Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll enjoy Dr Gotelli's response.&lt;/p&gt;

Howson" width="122"&gt;Deaf children at a school in Managua, Nicaragua, adapted and improved their communication by developing their own hand signs and a homemade system, a new study from the &lt;a href="http://www.chicago.edu"&gt;University of Chicago&lt;/a&gt; reports. From &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090215151441.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since 1996, I have been working with deaf adolescents and adults in Nicaragua who have not learned Nicaraguan Sign Language, but who have invented their own sign languages that they use with their families, friends and neighbors. I have learned that these small languages have many characteristics of languages that are signed and spoken around the world," said [Research Associate Marie] Coppola, who has videotaped and studied the interactions with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coppola observed Nicaraguans using gestures frequently when they spoke, and she noticed many, such as those used to describe eating, were consistent in their form. Deaf children are able to pick up on these gestures and their meanings, as well as invent others to communicate, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the school the child attended, the Melania Morales School for Special Education, was staffed with teachers who did not know sign language, with the thought that the children would have to learn how to speak and read people's lips. But the children "developed their own sign language as a way of communicating with each other"---that is, they figured out how to communicate with each other using the communication system most suited to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of my son. The words that he uses are not that many (but not only a few) and yet his communication is extensive, a language or rather an imprecise system of gestures, non-verbal uses of his voice, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3202472247/"&gt;ways of arranging his favorite items&lt;/a&gt;, that he's developed and that we seek ever to school ourselves in. Charlie works on his speech and communication every day at school and constantly around the house. As much as we keep teaching him to talk and as he is encouraged to, he's found ways that are, you could say, natural to himself, to get his message across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there's a need to communicate, there's a way.&lt;/p&gt;

Recent articles include ,Thomas R. Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population, Barriers to SCHIP enrollment, Marion Nestle, Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health, Eisenhower’s 1955 heart attack and Organ trading in Jordan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2008, they they significantly broadened their eclecticism by publishing book reviews by Intelligent Design proponents. Of interest to me, they published  &lt;a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.2990/27_2_52" rel="external "&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; by philosopher and dedicated anti-materialist &lt;a href="http://www.cuw.edu/Tools/faculty_staff/biographies/index.cfm?fs=angusmenuge" rel="external "&gt;Angus J. L. Menuge&lt;/a&gt; of “&lt;a href="http://www2.truman.edu/~edis/books/id/" rel="external "&gt;Why Intelligent Design Fails&lt;/a&gt;”. I’m interested of course, because I have a chapter in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why they would publish a review of a book published four years ago is not clear, but at least they could have got a reviewer who actually read the book. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets see how Dr. Menuge &lt;a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.2990/27_2_52" rel="external "&gt;fares with my chapter&lt;/a&gt; as an example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musgrave argues that the flagellum probably developed from a type III secretory system (TTSS), since they share a similar structure and function and contain homologous proteins. However, Scott Minnich, an expert on the flagellum, doubts this account, pointing out that 30 of the 40 or so proteins in the flagellum are not found in the TTSS, and that even if all the parts were available, their correct assembly depends on a complex control program that is arguably itself IC.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I don’t argue that the flagellum derives from a type 3 secretory system, I argue that the eubacterial flagellum and the TTSS share a common ancestor, a more primitive secretory system.&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt; Minnich’s “example” is just plain wrong, if the good Dr. had actually &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; my chapter, especially pages 77-79 and 81 he would have realised that.&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now point 1 may seem a little nit picky, but if the guy can’t even get that fairly clear point right, then there’s not much hope that the rest will be better. Which is amply demonstrated with the Minnich quote. If he had read those pages in my chapter, where I show that the whole “40 proteins” thing is a furphy, and that as of 2004, 80-88% of all the core flagella proteins have a homologue in either the TTSS or other associated systems (eg. the motor proteins of the flagella are homologous to other motor proteins that drive secretory systems) he wouldn’t have made that remark (or at the very least checked the research I quoted to make sure). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that was back in 2004, since then evidence has steadily been accumulating of even more relatedness between the eubacterial flagellum and the TTSS. Nick Matzke and Mark Pallen published &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v4/n10/full/nrmicro1493.html" rel="external "&gt;a pretty good paper &lt;/a&gt;in 2006 outlining the homologies found (nicks post on Pandas, showing the homology table is &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/09/flagellum-evolu.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and Nick’s magisterial review of bacterial flagellar evolution is &lt;a href="http://www.talkdesign.org/faqs/flagellum.html#update" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the review was published in 2008, from the evidence I cited in my chapter, it was clear Minnich’s assertions were wrong. And there has been a huge amount of work since then  in the open literature (and on the web), especially by NicK Matzke and Mark Pallen, which comprehensively demolishes Minnich’s statement. Yet Menuge, in 2008, drags Minnich’s quote out without comment. Not exactly work of a high scholarly calibre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what about the archebacterial flagellum? Is that chopped liver? Here we have an example of a flagellar system with clear intermediates from secretory system, to gliding motility stsyem to swimming system. It’s as clear a refutation of Behe as you could want, but the ID proponets always ignore it. Completely. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style="width:606px"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/18/images/Arche_Flagella.jpg" rel=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/assets_c/2009/02/Arche_Flagella-thumb-600x450-338.jpg" alt="Arche_Flagella.jpg" width="600" height="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The archebacterial flagellum, this is clearly homologous to the type IV secretory system, which is also a gliding motility system, which in turn is clearly homologous to the type II secretory system.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Musgrave does provide a broad three-step narrative for the appearance of
the flagellum, he admits it is only a “possible scenario”(p. 82)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s because there is &lt;strong&gt;more than one possible way to build a flagellum&lt;/strong&gt;. I suggested that there was a gliding motility stage in the evolution of the eubacterial flagellum, just like there was in the archebacterial flagellum and the syneccocus swimming system (how come IDers never mention the non-flagella swimming systems either, or comment on them?). But the flagellum could have gone straight from secretion to swimming as the motility of truncated flagella shows us is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the whole point of Behe’s claims is that there is no possible function, &lt;em&gt;in principle&lt;/em&gt;, of isolated parts of the flagellum. The fact that you can indeed find, even in principle, functional intermediates, blows away his argument. Add to that we actually have examples of functioning intermediates, they very things Behe says can’t exist, and Behe’s argument is demolished. But Menuge doesn’t mention this (or the examples I document).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the review is like this, ignoring substantial arguments and missing the point. You get the very clear impression Menuge just flipped through the book, saw a key word and wrote down some ID boilerplate without actually going through the process of actually reading the book or thinking deeply about it (Flagella, okay write down Minnich’s stuff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, if ID folks are reduced to writing reviews of  four year old books that can only be published in obscure journals, you know the ID program is going badly. I wonder if they will cite this review as evidence that they publish in peer-reviewed journals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jersey, &lt;a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;amp;id=6664713"&gt;this thing fell out of the sky this morning&lt;/a&gt; and smashed through a warehouse roof:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;amp;id=6664713"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/warehouse_intruder.jpg" alt="Metal that fell into a new jersey warehouse"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the frak is that thing? They say it made a huge noise as it tore through the roof, and was too hot to touch for a half hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obviously not natural, but what is it? It’s metal, so maybe it did fall from orbit. Unlike meteorites, which slow rapidly in the upper atmosphere and cool the rest of the way down to the ground, manmade objects deorbiting can still be hot when they hit; they start at lower angles to the air and don’t necessarily slow as rapidly (this thing looks dense, so its weight-to-surface area is high, meaning it won’t slow as much). Could it be from a satellite or rocket launch? Maybe. We don’t know enough yet to be sure. However, I very much doubt it’s from the satellite collision last week, since there simply hasn’t been enough time to see much orbital decay from the shrapnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update (19:00 Mountain Time): From the comments, &lt;a href="http://www.usmexpress.com/wearparts.html#anchor_14099"&gt;we may have a winner&lt;/a&gt;. Looks like a grinder tip to me. How it feel through the warehouse roof with such a high temperature is another issue…] &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Smashed-Car-Owner-Suspects-Meteorite/enJZ7QtLAkmrEUwHqljhDg.cspx"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/alabama_skyrock.jpg" alt="Rock that fell from the sky and hit a car"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The second object is rock of some sort, which &lt;a href="http://www.cbs42.com/content/localnews/story/Smashed-Car-Owner-Suspects-Meteorite/enJZ7QtLAkmrEUwHqljhDg.cspx"&gt;an Alabama man claims fell from the sky&lt;/a&gt; in early February and hit his car. However, looking at the rock I don’t think it’s a meteorite. They don’t have layers like that one does; it looks like a sedimentary rock or even a metamorphic one, neither of which describes stony meteorites. It’s big, 20-30 cm across, so it’s hard to say from whence it came. A nearby explosion, slag from a factory (it happens), or even just plain old hoaxery. The owner claims he’ll send it someplace for analysis, so eventually we may find out.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s, like, for another person, so it’s different.  And just you’re up all night. And it’s not glamorous at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the task of telling her parents which, according to Bristol, was “harder than labor”.  “…it was just, like — I don’t even remember it because it was just, like, something I don’t want to remember.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol’s mom’s stance on sex education has been somewhat ambiguous, but on the conservative side.  Although her spokesperson has stated that she doesn’t support teaching abstinence-only, Sarah herself has said that she will not support sex education - an ambiguously strategic response from a republican with a pregnant teen at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite her lack of eloquence, Bristol is pretty clear stating that telling kids to practice abstinence is “not realistic at all”.  And additionally, she interviewed with Greta Van Susteran because she’d “love to [be] an advocate to prevent teen pregnancy because it’s not, like, a situation that you would want to strive for, I guess,”.  Hm, although she concedes that “abstinence is the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; option”, one might infer from her statements that she supports sex education,  a surprisingly positive position, given her background.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stacey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234987614218"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-6992104499739647315">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b86fc63605f0ef4b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Anonymous comments.</title><published>2009-02-18T19:41:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T19:43:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/Il0n0kpG-rY/anonymous-comments.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=6992104499739647315" title="6 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/anonymous-comments.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Unless I hear an objection, I think I will close down the anonymous comments feature.

In stage one, the story goes, we were properly modest, obedient to the theoretical hegemony of the Modern Synthesis, and merely trying to bring paleontology into the fold. But the prospect of worldly fame beguiled us, so we broke our ties of fealty and tried, in stage two, to usurp power by painting punctuated equilibrium as a revolutionary doctrine that would dethrone the Synthesis, resurrect the memory of the exiled martyr (Richard Goldschmidt), and reign over a reconstructed realm of theory. But we were too big for our breeches, and the old guard still retained some life. They fought back mightily and effectively, exposing our bombast and emptiness. We began to hedge, retreat, and apologize, and have been doing so ever since in an effort to regain grace and, chastened in stage three, to sit again, in heaven or Valhalla, with the evolutionary elite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In particular, and most offensive to me, the urban legend rests on the false belief that radical, "middle-period" punctuated equilibrium became a saltational theory wedded to Goldschmidt's hopeful monsters as a mechanism. I have labored to refute this nonsensical charge from the day I first heard it. But my efforts are doomed within the self-affirming structure of the urban legend. We all know, for so the legend proclaims, that I once took the Goldschmidtian plunge. So if I ever deny the link, I can only be retreating from an embarrassing error. And if I, continue to deny the link with force and gusto, well, then I am only backtracking even harder (into stage 3) and apologizing (or obfuscating) all the more. How about the obvious (and accurate) alternative: that we never made the Goldschmidtian link; that this common error embodies a false construction; and that our efforts at correction have always represented an honorable attempt to relieve the confusion of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Read the rest &lt;a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_structure.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/0HLrnTcyyaA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234986869652"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/a_little_too_close_to_home.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b70eebd098f4f07</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">A little too close to home</title><published>2009-02-18T18:53:21Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T18:53:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/IGo2SLWywb8/a_little_too_close_to_home.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/a_little_too_close_to_home.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/features/112/feature_items/411815"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/a_little_too_close_to_home/ba.jpeg" width="425" height="137" alt="ba.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/a_little_too_close_to_home.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/IGo2SLWywb8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234984244218"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2237">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a1d4f2279b40ee1a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><category term="Intelligent Design/Creationism"/><category term="Facebook"/><category term="Intelligent Design"/><category term="memes"/><title type="html">Charles Darwin Tagged You in a Note on Facebook</title><published>2009-02-18T19:05:07Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T19:05:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/charles-darwin-tagged-you-in-a-note-on-facebook/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2211068/"&gt;Slate Magazine has looked at Facebook’s “25 Random Things About Me” craze&lt;/a&gt; but failed to find the Patient Zero that started the whole thing. This led to an interesting conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the absence of a singular “25 Things” creator reveals something much more interesting: Facebook organisms are not created by intelligent design. They evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that culture spreads in biological ways has been around for a while. Richard Dawkins coined the term &lt;em&gt;meme&lt;/em&gt; in 1976’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0192860925?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=slatmaga-20&amp;amp;link_code=as3&amp;amp;camp=211189&amp;amp;creative=373489&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0192860925"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Selfish Gene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to describe how ideas propagate according to evolutionary principles of mutation and selection. A quantitative study of the “25 Things” letter seems to ratify that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slate Magazine isn’t the first to draw the evolution connection. When I was originally tagged about 3 weeks ago, it was called the “25 Random Things About Me ‘Meme’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slate also tracked some of the various mutations of the meme as it evolved from 16 random facts to 15, 17, 22, 35, and even 100. Those other mutations didn’t survive but 25 proved to be the magic number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There it is, evolution in action.&lt;/p&gt;

She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging, and even if I did my wife needs me more. Because I foresaw this coming, however, I do have a series of "Best of" reposts lined up. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks. Right now I just don't know. The following piece has obviously been updated considerably from its original appearance in 2006.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approach this week's topic with a bit of trepidation, even though I've been meaning to discuss it ever since this blog started. Over the weekend, I decided I had put it off long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, you might ask, would I approach this topic with trepidation? A reasonable question, and I will give what I hope to be a reasonable answer. For one thing, this topic forces me to drift to areas more political than I normally like and is likely to provoke some angry reactions. More importantly, though, I'm about to discuss a medical organization that is steeped in an utterly toxic brew of bad science and extreme ideology. &lt;em&gt;So what?&lt;/em&gt; you might ask. Well, there are some fairly prominent physicians that belong to this organization, including Ron Paul, among others, and you never know who in my own place of employment or referral base might also belong. For all I know, one of my bosses might belong. I sincerely hope this isn't the case (or if it is they just don't know about the organization's extreme views), but you never know, and what I'm about to write is going to be harsh indeed because articles from the journal published by this organization are often cited by cranks and pseudoscientists. Sometimes they even make their way into the mainstream press as though they were legitimate scientific studies. Make no mistake, though, when it comes to medical science, this organization deserves every harsh word that I am about to write because it is a major booster of antivaccinationism, HIV/AIDS denialism, and the now discredited hypothesis that abortion causes breast cancer, while on its pages it regularly attacks the very concept of evidence-based medicine and peer-review. That it is an organization of physicians is all the more appalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group to which I refer is the &lt;a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Association of American Physicians and Surgeons&lt;/a&gt; (AAPS), and its journal is the &lt;a href="http://www.jpands.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons&lt;/a&gt; (abbreviated JPANDS, because "JAPS" has some rather obvious negative connotations). It is not an exaggeration to say that the AAPS, through its journal JPANDS, is waging a war on science- and evidence-based medicine in the name of its politics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_journal_of_american_physicians_and_s.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_journal_of_american_physicians_and_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/H4N1kQPIzAg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234979915414"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/high_hopes_for_the_low_lands">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bccc92d3d8f1978a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">High Hopes for the Low Lands</title><published>2009-02-18T17:54:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T17:54:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/high_hopes_for_the_low_lands" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Ed. This is part of our &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?category_id=27915"&gt;international guest series&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="netherlands1" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/netherlands1.jpg" alt="plains with a waterway in foreground and windmill in background" width="350"&gt;I live in the Netherlands. People that don’t live here will probably associate us with cheese, tulips, wooden shoes, lots of water, possibly milk and butter, and a number of other things (possibly about Dutch attitudes ;D) that I don’t know about. Thinking about the Netherlands, autism will probably not be the first thing on everyone’s mind, but it is on mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start at a beginning: getting diagnosed. In my country, diagnoses are made by psychiatrists or gz-psychologists (healthcare psychologists. I managed to find a definition in English &lt;a href="http://www.vanmanenpsychologen.nl/engelse/engelse.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). DSM-latest is the standard. A large number of different sorts of tests and conversations with the one who is being diagnosed and their family have to be carried out. Waiting lists for diagnosis are very long (depending somewhat on region), unless you have the money to pay for it yourself instead of going for diagnosis at a place that insurance will cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re a small country, but regional variety in diagnoses can still be seen: some areas have a larger number of people being diagnosed PDD-NOS, other areas seem to favour Asperger’s, for example. What diagnosis you end up with seems to depend to a large extent on the psychiatrist’s whim. The only real value a diagnosis has, is to signify that you are indeed on the autism spectrum. It is not very specific. There is talk of doing away with the different diagnoses, and just having one: ASD (or, in Dutch: ASS…. I know, I know… everyone take a minute to laugh now and get it out of your system :D).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism is still not widely known. Almost everyone I know has either never heard of it at all, or has some stereotypical idea of it (you’re either Rainman or Einstein). The government has only recently really become aware of it as a separate entity. The NVA (Dutch Autism Society) has been around for quite some time, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NVA is an advocacy organisation, but not a self-advocacy organisation. On the whole, I think it is a good organisation (and they listen to suggestions). I haven’t heard much about self-advocacy organisations in the Netherlands at all. If there is anything around here, locally, it’s managed to fly entirely under my radar, and I’m pretty autism-oriented! I do know about &lt;a href="http://www.pasnederland.nl/"&gt; PAS&lt;/a&gt;, but I have never really looked at it in-depth, because they exclude such a large proportion of Dutch autistics: they are entirely geared towards, and only accept members with, a normal or above-average intelligence (for as far as anyone can tell, and I have to question exactly what they mean by that: do they require you to be able to speak, for example? I have no idea. I ought to check it out, even though I won’t like it no matter what their criteria are). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be hard to pick one single greatest difficulty that autistic people encounter in this country. It varies. Right now for me it’s jobs and housing and more specifically the accommodations needed for these things, but that wasn’t always what I struggled with most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our educational system is pretty much failing autistic students, of any age. I don’t know much about the options for children age 4-16/17/18 apart from the fact that the situation is very far from ideal (I take my information on this from the NVA website). I can tell you about university: when I went there I did not have my diagnosis yet, but if I had had it, it wouldn’t have made a difference: there wasn’t anything available. A few years after I had left my university, I read about it implementing its first services for autistic students. I was happy they were doing something, but what they were doing was, and is even now, painfully inadequate. Thinking back, my university wasn’t very disability-friendly in general (the location was in an old town centre, all the buildings were labyrinths of stairs and narrow hallways).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel more hopeful looking at housing for autistic people, imperfect though it is. Housing in general is a problem right now in my country, for anyone. It’s a very long subject, and I’ll go into more detail in another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at what I wrote, I painted a far from perfect picture. It’s not as bad as it can seem when you’re so in the middle of it all. Services and such are imperfect but mostly, they do exist. Above all: there is a strong basis for hope that everything I’ve mentioned can improve, and not even necessarily on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>v.d.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A police spokesperson from Buffalo speaking about yesterday's plane crash on BBC Radio 4 this morning said that in addition to all the people on the plane (no one survived) there was "one subject in the residence". The baffled Radio 4 presenter had to repeat back a translation into normal English.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This use of subject is certainly standard police practice, at least in the U.S., as a sample of police-blotter reports from Google News makes clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A Bend officer spotted someone on foot in the area and tried to contact the subject, who fled on foot in the area of Big Sky Park.&lt;br&gt;
A subject wearing a black hat and white jacket had stolen a 30-pack case of Budweiser beer.&lt;br&gt;
At 8:06 a.m., the Quay County Sheriff’s Department received several reports of a male subject walking with a baby along the westbound lane of Interstate-40, and it appeared that the subject’s vehicle had broken down.  A Sheriff’s deputy advised that the subject’s vehicle was out of gas and the officer had taken gas to the vehicle.&lt;br&gt;
At 12:35 p.m., a female reported subjects riding 4-wheelers recklessly on Quay Road AK.&lt;br&gt;
At 6:59 p.m., a female reported there was a subject standing in the median on south First Street asking people for money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking the OED suggests a medical origin for the usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e.&lt;/strong&gt; A body used for anatomical examination or demonstration; a dead body intended for or undergoing dissection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1710&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Phil. Trans.&lt;/em&gt; XXVII. 71 In our Subject the Hairs are every where pretty long.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1729&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ibid.&lt;/em&gt; XXXVI. 167 This Subject..had her Lungs full of small Tubercles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f. &lt;/strong&gt;A person who presents himself for or undergoes medical or surgical treatment; hence, one who is affected with some disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1822-34&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Good's Study Med.&lt;/em&gt; (ed. 4) III. 485 The subject was forty-five years of age, and had evinced a slight rhachitic tendency from infancy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1859&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Todd's Cycl. Anat.&lt;/em&gt; V. 178/2 Two of the subjects died after severe instrumental labour.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1898&lt;/strong&gt; H. BROWN &lt;em&gt;Secret Gd. Health&lt;/em&gt; 91 Smoking helps the subject to rest.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1898&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Allbutt's Syst. Med.&lt;/em&gt; V. 276 A broad line of dilated venules is often seen in emphysematous subjects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police use of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is missing from the OED entry, suggesting that it's either American or recent or both. Curiously, the use of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subject &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;in general reports of human research is also missing, except for this curious residue of late-19th-century cultural preoccupations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;g.&lt;/strong&gt; Psychical Research. A person upon whom an experiment is made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1883&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Proc. Soc. Psych. Research&lt;/em&gt; 18 July 251 A specific influence or effluence, passing from the operator to the ‘subject’.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1886&lt;/strong&gt; GURNEY, etc. &lt;em&gt;Phantasms of Living&lt;/em&gt; I. 16 The ‘subject's’ hand seemed to obey the other person's will with almost the same directness as that person's own hand would have done.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that psychical research was the only kind, in those days, that used the word &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to mean "person"? Or does it just reflect a bias in the OED's reading program?  These days, and for quite a few years in the past, pretty much every one of the hundreds of thousands of research reports involving "human subjects" will use the word in that way. Here's a small sample from recent BioMedCentral publications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the two-actor or "Joint" conditions the participants performed the task in an alternating fashion, meaning that when one subject performed the task (actor) the other observed (observer).&lt;br&gt;
Recently, we  studied  the  prevalence  of bruxism  in the general adult population using a custom-made color-stained plastic sheet,  the BruxChecker, on the maxillary dentition overnight and found that occlusal contacts where the color was ground off were seen in the majority of subjects, indicating sleep bruxism.&lt;br&gt;
Figure 1. PM involvement in a subject with RCA territorial infarction.&lt;br&gt;
DNA samples were available in 371 subjects.&lt;br&gt;
Variation in basal heat shock protein 70 is correlated to core temperature in human subjects.&lt;br&gt;
To predict how attrition might bias the results, others have shown that subjects who participate after reminders are fairly similar to the non-responders.&lt;br&gt;
44.5% of subjects reported current PA at six months post partum.&lt;br&gt;
Each of these subjects were trained in the use of the monitor and given written instructions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234978733172"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/18/letter-to-the-higgs/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb94cbb325895c00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Letter to the Higgs</title><published>2009-02-18T17:36:57Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T17:36:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/18/letter-to-the-higgs/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/1"&gt;Abstruse Goose&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite web-comics, has an &lt;a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/118"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to the Higgs boson:&lt;/p&gt;

Observers like me were somewhat puzzled by the idea of the Department of Health paying substantial sums of money to enable industry lobbyists to set up a regulator their own industry. Our concerns appear to have been justified by the current outbreak of censorship on the site. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It used to be much like the Sun, but the store of nuclear fuel in its core is running out. Due to the nuclear processes going on deep inside it, its energy production has vastly increased, blasting out thousands of times the energy it did when it was a stable star. The outer layers of the star absorb this energy, and, like a hot air balloon, expand hugely. Even though it is now far, far brighter than it used to be, the expansion actually &lt;em&gt;cools&lt;/em&gt; the star’s surface. It has become a bloated, swollen red giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the surface is cooler, more complex molecules can form there. What astronomers call &lt;em&gt;dust&lt;/em&gt;, they are blasted by the intense brightness of the light coming up from below. And because the star has expanded so much, its gravity at the surface is much lower, too. The huge force upwards from the light cannot be held back by the feeble gravity, and the dust is launched into space, creating a spherical shell around the star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, for the first time, &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/press-rel/pr-2009/pr-06-09.html"&gt;astronomers have taken the sharpest infrared pictures ever of that shell as it is hurled into space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Stars/phot-06b-09-fullres.tif.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/tlep_vlt.jpg" alt="The dying star T Leporis, compared to the orbit of the Earth."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above is not an illustration, &lt;em&gt;it’s an actual image&lt;/em&gt; of a red giant star undergoing dying paroxysms and blasting a dense shell of molecules into space. As you can see by the comparison drawing of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, T Lep has expanded to a diameter of nearly 300 million kilometers (180 million miles). At first, I thought the ring around the star was not real, and was instead what’s called an imaging artifact; a mirage due to optical effects inside a telescope or camera. &lt;em&gt;But it’s actually the dense shell of ejected material from the star.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incredible picture was not taken by a single telescope. It was produced by combining the light of four different 1.8 meter telescopes in a process called interferometry. It’s a fiendishly complex process that virtually creates a telescope that has the same resolution (ability to see small objects) as a single telescope spanning the separation between the smaller ones. In other words, separate the smaller ’scopes by 100 meters, and you can create a virtual telescope 100 meters across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer the wavelength, the easier this process is (though it’s never easy); in this case the image was taken in the infrared. It took multiple observing sessions over several nights, but in the end the astronomers were able to see objects as small as two milliarcseconds across– much smaller than Hubble can resolve, and equivalent to an object just four meters across sitting on the Moon’s surface!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/Videos/Stars/vid-06a-09_P_FLASH.flv.html"&gt;The ESO created a cool zoom-in of T Lep&lt;/a&gt;, starting just south of Orion and ending with the super-high-resolution image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/FfjZmG9UVus%26fmt%3D18&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=350" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This superior resolution can allow astronomers to determine the size, shape, density, and structure of the stellar wind blowing off the surface of T Lep, which will help them understand how stars like this die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by &amp;quot;stars like this&amp;quot;, I mean &lt;em&gt;stars like the Sun&lt;/em&gt;. Some day, about 6 to 7 billion years from now, our Sun will run out of hydrogen in its core and swell up into a red giant just like T Lep has. Take another look at that image; see how the surface of the star is almost touching the size of the Earth’s orbit? We don’t know exactly how big the Sun will get, but that size right there is a pretty good guess. What happens to the Earth at that point is fairly clear, and the news won’t be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun’s clock is ticking. It has a lot of ticks left, but the number is finite. Studying stars like T Lep let us take a peek into our own distant future, and techniques like infrared interferometry make sure that the glimpse we get is ever-more sharply focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to learn more about how the Sun will die, then read Chapter 7 of my book,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;You’ll get all the details, maybe more than you want. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even my uvula has ulcers, and while I've been pottering about in forums, I've not had the energy to write a proper blog post with research and stuff. Anyway, I have lots of lovely drugs now, and I'm on the mend, so will endeavour to pick up the slack again soon.

With the stroke of a pen, $789,500,000,000 has been “spent”. The bill includes roughly $18B for science research, and over $50B for education.&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/182px-barack_obama_signaturesvg.png" title="Obama signature"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/182px-barack_obama_signaturesvg.png" alt="Obama signature"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The National Science Foundation receives $3B, of which $2B goes directly to peer-reviewed science. Given that the total budget for NSF is $6B a year, this is a significant increase. The Department of Energy Office of Science receives $1.6B, while energy programs at the DOE receive over $30B. NASA receives $1B, of which almost half goes to Earth science climate research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sent email or made phone calls, please take a moment now to thank your Senators and Representatives. Many people worked very, very hard to ensure that science was adequately funded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of money, all of which needs to be spent on a very short timescale. But it sends a clear message that science is important to the future of this Nation, and this Planet.&lt;/p&gt;

We have a synopsis now, and it isn't good news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Darwin we meet in CREATION is a young, vibrant father, husband and friend whose mental and physical health gradually buckles under the weight of guilt and grief for a lost child. Ultimately it is the ghost of Annie, his adored 10 year-old daughter who leads him out of darkness and helps him reconnect with his wife and family. Only then is he able to create the book that changed the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They've got to be kidding. I'm assuming it is only a &lt;i&gt;metaphorical&lt;/i&gt; ghost, not a real one, but given the dreadful melodramatic botch of a story there, I can't even be sure of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/oh_crap.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/eEcWMja5SZs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234972039489"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/more_on_the_neandertal_genome.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef2b0b20ba066f3e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">More on the Neandertal genome</title><published>2009-02-18T14:39:14Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T14:39:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/TVj9rr6a0j8/more_on_the_neandertal_genome.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/more_on_the_neandertal_genome.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When a milestone in the Neandertal genome project was announced last week, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/neandertal_genome_or_a_prematu.php"&gt;I was a little underwhelmed&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/evo_bleh.jpeg" width="413" height="181" alt="evo_bleh.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It implies that evolution is linear, that it is going somewhere, and of course, that it is all about people — all the wrong messages. Yet it is ubiquitous, and probably the most common rendering you&amp;#39;ll find anywhere. Try googling for images of evolution, and you will turn it up, or variants on it, or jokes built on it…it&amp;#39;s a bit annoying and trite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Although, when I googled to find that image — which was easy — I also found &lt;a href="http://www.bordalierinstitute.com/target1.html"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/animalsEvolution_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/animalsEvolution.jpeg" width="400" height="565" alt="animalsEvolution.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very nice. I like it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually a problem. When we&amp;#39;re trying to get the message of the science of evolution across to people, one thing that helps is having a story — people respond well to narratives. The canonical image definitely tells a story, which is probably why it caught the public imagination so well, but the problem is that it is the &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution should not be portrayed as an epic tale with a beginning and an end, with a narrative drive to a conclusion, with a single hero or even any heroes at all. Trying to shoehorn it into a simple linear story destroys the meaning. Does this mean our efforts to catch the attention of a fickle public are doomed, because science does not fit the story-telling conventions that best fit the human mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. Here's an interesting analogy, a comparison of the evolution story to a dramatic convention that the public does eat up happily: &lt;a href="http://watchingtheworldwakeup.blogspot.com/2009/02/darwin-aeneid-and-days-of-our-lives.html"&gt;evolution is like a soap opera&lt;/a&gt;. I can see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both have lots of characters and story lines, every one full of anguish and drama, some ending happily (for a while), others ending miserably; individuals come and go, they get their brief period in the spotlight, then poof, everything moves on to the next big new event. There is no one grand goal for the ensemble, just a series of overlapping dramas, some ridiculous, some mundane, and the vehicle to tie them all together is usually something commonplace — a town or a hospital, for instance — and stories can abandon that unifying premise freely. And it never ends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days of our Lives has been on the air since 1965. Dozens, probably hundreds, of characters have come and gone. There have been murders, affairs, rapes, and (for all I know) alien abductions. The show isn't going anywhere. And yet as any soap-opera fan will tell you, their favorite soap has had dozens and dozens of riveting, heart-breaking stories over the years, that make the series so gratifying and rewarding in the long run.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And that's exactly the deal with evolution. It isn't going anywhere, and yet it's going to keep on going and going and going for as long as there's planet to go on, and even after that it'll probably be going on someplace else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Cool. And yet, somehow, all that chaos and confusion and complexity and strangely unresolvable big picture manages to engross viewers day after day after day, in the case of the soaps. There's a lesson there that we need to figure out: how can we map the science of evolution onto the imaginations of human beings?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/there_is_no_one_simple_evoluti.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/j4sft-Cr9vo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234970880849"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3545645658526679316">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/29c381ba7335c1ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Skeptically Speaking</title><published>2009-02-18T14:37:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T15:44:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/CR4wJ7xA2tU/skeptically-speaking.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/3545645658526679316/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=3545645658526679316" title="34 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/skeptically-speaking.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">As some of you know, for about five years I've been a monthly instructional columnist for what I consider to be the best national billiard magazine in America. I'm not too bad at pool, as you would guess. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last night during our local league play, someone was getting up a game of ringer nine-ball. It's a gambling game in which several people can play. I've played it with as many people as 9 players! Anyone who sinks the 5-ball gets $1 from everyone, and anyone who sinks the 9-ball gets $2 from everyone. If there are five players and I run the rack I get $12 (4 times $3). [Sometimes the bet is $2 on the 5-ball and $5 on the 9]. When you first get into the game you start last, so sometimes you'll have to pay out some money before you even get a chance on a good decent shot. Sometimes even when you get a shot it's a really tough one since you follow a shooter who may miss and accidentally leave you really bad. I got into the game after it started and paid out some money waiting for my first decent shot. Players must get lucky again and again to get other decent shots in subsequent games. Eventually I won about $25. But while I was paying out I called it "the devil's game." That's what it's called because you must get lucky to get some decent shots on the money balls. Depending on how much money you have and how many players are in the game you may never get one before you run out of disposable cash. But when I said it was "the devil's game" a friend of mine said, "Yeah, right, an atheist believes in the devil."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This event reminded me of what I am reading in Dr. David Eller's fantastic book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1578840023?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1578840023&amp;amp;adid=0Q4FWRMXSE517S0SQ4E0&amp;amp;"&gt;Atheism Advanced&lt;/a&gt;. He argues convincingly that western cultures are dominated by Christian language, rituals, symbols, arts, music, habits, and so forth. It's as if we are almost imprisoned in it. He writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We find in practice that atheists in Christian-dominated societies speak and think in Christian terms just as surely as Christians do. We let Christianity set the agenda, identify the questions, and provide the language of the debate. We quite literally 'speak Christian' just as fluently and just as un-self-consciously as they do."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eller continues:&lt;blockquote&gt; "We need to stop speaking Christian so as to loosen the grip of Christian language on our thinking....We do well to begin our debunking of religion with a debunking of religious terminology."&lt;/blockquote&gt;While I cannot begin to tell you all of the specifics of his brilliant analysis, and there is much more to it, I learned last night he is right. I'm going to make a conscious effort to avoid all religious and Christian terminology for starters. In pool we also speak about "the pool gods," as a metaphor for good luck. When we cuss sometimes we'll say "God damn it," or "Go to hell." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

As a result such research ground to a halt in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the order was presented as a compromise, the effect was chilling in its application. No researcher receiving federal dollars (even for a separate project) could do embryonic stem cell research, except on the approved lines.  Institutions could not risk losing federal grants and so had to purge themselves of any banned research. The approved lines did not turn out to be as useful as was originally claims, and they became progressively obsolete as new techniques were being developed through state and private funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to measure the effect that Bush’s ban had on ultimate scientific progress in this area. It is not just that we lost eight years - expertise in a cutting-edge scientific area can be a tenuous cultural and institutional thread, once broken it is difficult to recreate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will hopefully have a chance to find out. It was expected that one of the first measures of the Obama administration would be to lift the federal ban. In fact, I am a bit surprised it has not happened already. But it seems it soon will - &lt;a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-science/20090215/SCIENCE-US-USA-OBAMA-STEMCELLS/"&gt;insiders are saying&lt;/a&gt; that Obama plans to lift the ban soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are cells taken from recently fertilized eggs that are still in the embryo stage. They are the most totipotent cells known - they have the potential to turn into any cell type in the body. For this reason they hold great research promise. Possible applications might include replacing cells in a diseased or damaged organ to repair lost function. For example, if motor neurons are dying in patients with ALS (Lou Gerhigs disease), stem cells might be capable of replacing the lost motor neurons and halting or even reversing the disease. Right now there is no other technology that can even theoretically accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical controversy, of course, is that embryonic stem cells must be harvested from human embryos. It is this concern that led to the Federal ban under Bush. This controversy is not likely to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the promise of stem cell therapy has not yet been achieved. This is a research program into a new and highly complex technology. It is still too early to predict how it will eventually pan out. That is the nature of research. Of course the only way we will find out is by increasing our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting developments in recent years in stem cell research is the ability to convert an adult-derived stem cell into one that has the features of an embryonic stem cell. In 2007 researchers from the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at UCLA published a paper in which they demonstrated that they could &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070606235430.htm"&gt;convert adult derived mouse fibroblast cells into stem cells&lt;/a&gt; with feature of embryonic stem cells by changing only four genes. This was far fewer than imagined, making the technology seem highly plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last month &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090107134633.htm"&gt;Boston University School of Medicine researchers published&lt;/a&gt; that they could accomplish the four gene changes with a single viral vector, rather than using multiple vectors - simplifying the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research has the potential to make the embryonic stem cell controversy moot (in a way). If adult-derived cells could be turned into stem cells with all the potential of embryonic derived cells then that would obviate the need to harvest cells from embryos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, ironically, these developments would not have been possible without embryonic stem cell research itself. Even if adult-derived substitutes can be made, there is simply no way to predict what we will not discover (or which discoveries will be greatly delayed) by banning a certain avenue of research.&lt;/p&gt;

Inspired by a pair of essays &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7231/full/457788a.html"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v457/n7231/full/457786a.html"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; the idea it has created a pretty healthy debate among the sciencebloggers including &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gnxp/2009/02/race_iq.php"&gt;Razib&lt;/a&gt; with whom I will likely never agree on this issue.  For the record, I'm on the side of those like Richard Nisbett (for a good review of his analysis of race and the black white divide see here &lt;a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nisbett/racegen.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) that genetics are a poor explanation for the divide.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this issue aside, why do I believe this is a still a &lt;i&gt;bad idea&lt;/i&gt; to expend resources to evaluate the role of race and IQ?

Since earlier this month, he has been held at the Portage County Jail, on a $2 million bond for two charges, one of which is the attempted murder of his mother, Gertrude Steuernagel. Steuernagel died on February 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case brings out too questions, none easy and none with ready answers. There is a &lt;a href="http://www.e-portage.us/newsgen/news_details.php?id=327"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of an interview with Major Dennis Missimi, of the Portage County Sheriff’s Office that goes into detail about how Walker is doing. Relatives have been visiting him and he is not housed in "general population," but in the intake area, where he is being closely monitored.  Major Missimi notes that the sheriff's department has received "Crisis Intervention Team Training" and that Walker is being evaluated by someone from the Kevin Coleman Center, which "specializes in treating people with mental disabilities." Major Missimi concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that he shouldn’t be here and I know that the prosecutor’s office along with &lt;a href="http://odmrdd.state.oh.us/"&gt;MRDD&lt;/a&gt; [Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities] and mental health are doing everything they can to try to find another facility. We just need to find that he’s eligible for and that will take him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main concern is his safety and the safety of our staff. We’re going to continue doing what we’re doing and continue to respond to questions. Its just one of those things. You know we have never been faced with this before. This administration is one that wants to do best for the community so that’s what we are going to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know we have never been faced with this before." And now the Portage County Sheriff's Office is and, really, we all are, how can we find answers to "this" that are just, and that are ethical, and that take into account Sky Walker's diagnosis and situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Washington state, &lt;a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?year=2009&amp;amp;bill=2078"&gt;House Bill 2078&lt;/a&gt;, "Concerning persons with developmental disabilities who are in correctional facilities or jail," proposes to reinstate medical and other services for people with developmental disabilities while they are incarcerated, according to yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.tri-cityherald.com/901/story/481096.html"&gt;Tri-City Herald&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, these services are lost while a person is in jail; the bill would also "direct the Developmental Disabilities Council to establish a screening tool for identifying when someone booked into a jail has a developmental disability, and provide training for corrections officers in how to handle those people while in jail." Beki Hissam is both the chaplain for Benton County jail in Washington and also the parent of an adult child with a developmental disability. She says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Corrections staff need supports in place when faced with the challenge of folks with developmental disabilities in the jai....Individuals with DD also need supports in place to help them understand an environment that is difficult for 'typical' people to understand. These are the most vulnerable people served in the correction facility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill also directs Developmental Disabilities Council to establish a screening tool that would be used for someone who is booked into the jail and who has a developmental disability; requires that "people identified as having developmental disabilities be given reasonable accommodations while in jail"; and helps people with developmental disabilities after they are released from jail via a transition system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal justice system has a long way to go regarding accommodating individuals with developmental disabilities. What will be Sky Walker's future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the question I can't stop thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

How is this for a prediction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Pharyngula, Panda's Thumb, EvC, RichardDawkins.net and Uncommon Descent will all have so completely degenerated as to become nothing but embarrassing footnotes in the history of internet communication. I also predict that P.Z. Myers and Richard Dawkins will have so embarrassed their home institutions that overt attempts will have been initiated to have their tenures revoked on the grounds of moral turpitude and seeking to overthrow the government... Fortunately for them, by that date, February 9, 2009, the physical destruction of our civilization will have proceeded to such a degree that thinking people will no longer be concerned about intellectual trash like Richard Dawkins and P.Z. Myers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been over a week. No one has yet uncovered the loathsome pit of perversity I keep in the basement, nor has anyone even tried to stop Operation Whirling Squid, which will end with myself sitting in the throne of the World Emperor. I also don't quite detect any panicking mobs fleeing the chaos of a collapsing culture.&lt;/p&gt;

She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging, and even if I did my wife needs me more. Because I foresaw this coming, however, I do have a series of "Best of" reposts lined up. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks. Right now I just don't know. This post is an amalgamation of material from 2006 and 2008.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img height="90" width="120" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/images/rbicons/ResearchBlogging-Large-Trans.png" alt="ResearchBlogging.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THE ZOMBIE RISES AGAIN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C as a treatment for cancer is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/aug/05/cancer.medicalresearch"&gt;back in the news again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not surprised. This is one therapy favored by advocates of "alternative" medicine that keeps popping up periodically (seemingly every couple of years or so). This latest bit of news has turned up almost right on time after the last time there was a push for rehabilitating vitamin C as a cancer cure a couple of years ago. Back in the spring of 2006, there were &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=16157892"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/abstract/174/7/937"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; published (more on them later) which were touted by the "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) crowd as evidence that Linus Pauling was supposedly vindicated. A little less than two weeks ago, an &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/08/01/0804226105.abstract"&gt;animal study&lt;/a&gt; was published suggesting that high dose intravenous vitamin C had antitumor activity in mouse models. A couple of weeks prior, there had also been published a &lt;a href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/mdn377v4?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=ascorbate&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT"&gt;phase I clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; that showed that megadoses of IV ascorbate were safe and well-tolerated in cancer patients if they were appropriately screened for renal disease. Given the latest studies of this particular modality against cancer, it seemed like an opportune time for me to examine this new evidence and ask the question: Has Linus Pauling been vindicated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll cut to the chase. The short answer is: Not really, with the qualification that it depends on what you mean by "vindicated." The long answer follows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/vitamin_c_and_cancer_has_linus_pauling_b.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/vitamin_c_and_cancer_has_linus_pauling_b.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/0rC01EfDuP8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234935570180"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/657bca817e2e4a8e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">Bad and Good Stars in the Sky</title><published>2009-02-18T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-18T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/441-bad-and-good-stars-in-the-sky.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border:3px ridge #000000;margin:5px;float:right" alt="wm" src="http://www.randi.org/site/images/stories/swift/wm.jpg" height="418" width="262"&gt;Puerto Rico&amp;#39;s 76-year-old Walter Mercado is a fixture on Univision&amp;#39;s popular Spanish-language show &amp;quot;Primer Impacto.&amp;quot; If you&amp;#39;ve never seen his show, I&amp;#39;d spoil the experience for you by describing it. It may be enough for you to know that he has a doctorate in Divinity from the International Philo-Byzantine Academy &amp;amp; University, in 1969 he was inducted as a Universal Teacher in Poona, Bombay, in Tibet and Nepal he holds the title of Chela and Buddhist Bikku, he has been a minister of the California Christian Brotherhood since 1970, and he also has a doctorate in Divine Healing from Tokyo, Japan. On top of all that, Walter is an astrologer. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the flamboyant Liberace-costumed astrologer had the right stars aligned this week when a federal jury found that though he improperly broke his contract with his former management companies, he did not have to pay the millions of dollars they sought from him for lost profits and damages. Mercado's astonished attorney said he never had a jury find that a client broke contractual obligations but owed nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

And every thing’s amiss,&lt;br&gt;
A dull presuming atheist said,&lt;br&gt;
As stretch’d he lay beneath a shade,&lt;br&gt;
And instanced it in this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold, quoth he, that mighty thing,&lt;br&gt;
A pumpkin, large and round,&lt;br&gt;
Is held but by a little string,&lt;br&gt;
Which upwards cannot make it spring,&lt;br&gt;
Or bear it from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on this oak, an acorn small,&lt;br&gt;
So disproportion’d, grows;&lt;br&gt;
That, who with sense surveys this all,&lt;br&gt;
This universal casual ball,&lt;br&gt;
Its ill contrivance knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My better judgment would have hung&lt;br&gt;
The pumpkin on the tree,&lt;br&gt;
And left the acorn, lightly strung,&lt;br&gt;
‘Mongst things which on the surface sprung,&lt;br&gt;
And small and feeble be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more the caviller could say,&lt;br&gt;
Nor further faults descry;&lt;br&gt;
For as he upwards gazing lay,&lt;br&gt;
An acorn, loosen’d from its stay,&lt;br&gt;
Fell down upon his eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wounded part with tears ran o’er,&lt;br&gt;
As punish’d for the sin:&lt;br&gt;
Fool! had that bough a pumpkin bore,&lt;br&gt;
Thy whimseys would have work’d no more,&lt;br&gt;
Nor skull have kept them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the illustration &lt;a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/art/illustration/marks/4.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and was saved from having to scan it.

&lt;p&gt;My refutation:  falling coconuts kill more people each year than sharks.&lt;/p&gt;

This is one of Gould's most (in)famous papers, but one that I am convinced most people have not read carefully, or at least have not understood.  It's the one that is usually cited when Gould is accused of calling for a rejection of natural selection or population genetics.  Apparently it is also the one that caused many people to think that punctuated equilibria was a saltationist theory.  In this post, I will quote extensively from the paper, with some thoughts and opinions interjected throughout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To start, here is the abstract:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;     The modern synthesis, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;as an exclusive proposition&lt;/span&gt;, has broken down on both of its fundamental claims: &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;extrapolationism&lt;/span&gt; (gradual allelic substitution as a model for all evolutionary change) and &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;nearly exclusive reliance on selection&lt;/span&gt; leading to adaptation.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Evolution is a hierarchical process&lt;/span&gt; with complementary, but different, modes of change at its three major levels: variation within populations, speciation, and patterns of macroevolution.  Speciation is not always an extension of gradual, adaptive change to greater effect, but may represent, as Goldschmidt argued, a different style of genetic change--rapid reorganization of the genome, perhaps non-adaptive.  Macroevolutionary trends do not arise from the gradual, adaptive transformation of populations, but usually from &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;higher-order selection operating upon groups of species&lt;/span&gt;, while the individual species themselves generally do not change following their geologically instantaneous origin.  I refer to these two discontinuities in the evolutionary hierarchy as the Goldschmidt break (between change in populations and speciation) and the Wright break (between speciation and trends as differential success among species).&lt;br&gt;A new and general evolutionary theory will embody this notion of hierarchy and stress a variety of themes either ignored or explicitly rejected by the modern synthesis: punctuational change at all levels, important non-adaptive change at all levels, control of evolution not only by selection, but equally by constraints of history, development and architecture--thus restoring to evolutionary theory a concept of organism. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Emphasis added]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The paper proper is divided into six parts.  I will work through each in sequence, noting areas where I think confusion or misquotation have distorted the intended arguments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;I. The Modern Synthesis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gould begins by quoting what he calls "one of the last skeptical books written before the Darwinian tide of the modern synthesis asserted its hegemony", by Robson and Richards (1936):&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The theory of Natural Selection ... postulates that the evolutionary process is unitary, and that not only are groups formed by the multiplication of single variants having survival value, but also that such divergences are amplified to produce adaptations (both specializations and organization).  It has been customary to admit that certain ancillary processes are operative (isolation, correlation), but the importance of these, as active principles, is subordinate to selection. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Robson and Richards 1936, p.370-371].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He then summarizes the core of the Modern Synthesis as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Its foundation rests upon two major premises: (1) Point mutations (micromutations) are the ultimate source of variability.  Evolutionary change is a process of gradual allelic substitution within a population.  Events at broader scale, from the origin of new species to long-ranging evolutionary trends, represent the same process, extended in time and effect--large numbers of allelic substitutions incorporated sequentially over long periods of time.  In short, gradualism, continuity, and evolutionary change by the transformation of populations.  (2) Genetic variation is the raw material only.  Natural selection directs evolutionary change.  Rates and directions of change are controlled by selection with little constraint exerted by material (slow rates are due to weak selection, not insufficient variation).  All genetic change is adaptive (though some phenotypic effects, due to pleiotropy, etc., may not be).  In short, selection leading to adaptation. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.119-120.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As anyone reading this surely knows, there are exceptions to all of these assumptions.  Of course, proponents of the Modern Synthesis have always known this too.  But, as Gould points out:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;All the synthesists recognized exceptions and "ancillary processes," but they attempted to both prescribe a low relative frequency for them and to limit their application to domains of little evolutionary importance.  Thus, genetic drift certainly occurs--but only in populations so small and so near the brink that their rapid extinction will almost certainly ensue.  And phenotypes include many non-adaptive features by allometry and pleiotropy, but all are epiphenomena of primarily adaptive genetic changes and none can have any marked effect upon the organism (for, if inadaptive, they will lead to negative selection and elimination and, if adaptive, will enter the model in their own right).  Thus, a synthesist could always deny a charge of rigidity by invoking these official exceptions, even though their circumscription, both in frequency and effect, actually guaranteed the hegemony of the two cardinal principles. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.120].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Recognizing that he might be accused of erecting a straw man, he then quotes directly from Mayr (1963), one of the architects of the Modern Synthesis:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The proponents of the synthetic theory maintain that &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;all &lt;/span&gt;evolution is due to the accumulation of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;small &lt;/span&gt;genetic changes, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;guided by natural selection&lt;/span&gt;, and that transspecific evolution is &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;nothing but&lt;/span&gt; an extrapolation and magnification of the events that take place within populations and species.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Mayr 1963, p.586, emphasis added].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Referring specifically to this characterization of the synthesis, Gould wrote the following paragraph which, perhaps more than any of his other writings, raised the ire of defenders of the synthesis:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I well remember how the synthetic theory beguiled me with its unifying power when I was a graduate student in the mid-1960's. Since then I have been watching it slowly unravel as a universal description of evolution. The molecular assault came first, followed quickly by renewed attention to unorthodox theories of speciation and by challenges at the level of macroevolution itself. I have been reluctant to admit it--since beguiling is often forever--but if Mayr's characterization of the synthetic theory is accurate, then that theory, as a general proposition, is effectively dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.120].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, was it textbook orthodoxy, or was Gould making this up?  I don't have any textbooks from 1980, but here's what Freeman and Herron (2007, p.96) state in one of the most widely used evolution textbooks:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...the Modern Synthesis, or the Evolutionary Synthesis, was a consensus grounded in two propositions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gradual evolution results from small genetic changes that are acted upon by natural selection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The origin of species and higher taxa, or macroevolution, can be explained in terms of natural selection acting on individuals, or microevolution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nevertheless, critics construed Gould's statement about the death of the Modern Synthesis &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as characterized by Mayr&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to mean that he was advocating a total overthrow of evolutionary theory.  Here is how Charlesworth et al. (1982) quoted the passage above:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been watching it [neo-Darwinism] slowly unravel as a universal description of evolution ... I have been reluctant to admit it ... but ... that theory, as a general proposition, is effectively dead, despite its persistence as a text-book orthodoxy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I suspect that this is the version most people remember.  But here is the full quote again, with the cherry picked bits indicated:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I well remember how the synthetic theory beguiled me with its unifying power when I was a graduate student in the mid-1960's. Since then I&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; have been watching it slowly unravel as a universal description of evolution&lt;/span&gt;. The molecular assault came first, followed quickly by renewed attention to unorthodox theories of speciation and by challenges at the level of macroevolution itself. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;I have been reluctant to admit it&lt;/span&gt;--since beguiling is often forever--&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;but&lt;/span&gt; if Mayr's characterization of the synthetic theory is accurate, then &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;that theory, as a general proposition, is effectively dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What Gould argues in Part I is simply that the Modern Synthesis, as it had developed by 1980, had a rather narrow focus on small-scale variation and natural selection, and assumed that most major evolutionary patterns could be explained by extrapolating processes within populations into deep time.  What he was rejecting was this very narrow interpretation, though later critics gave the impression that he was challenging all aspects of the synthesis and calling for a revolution in evolutionary theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;II. Reduction and Hierarchy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this section, Gould highlights the inherent conflict between reductionism/extrapolationism and a theory involving hierarchy and emergence.  As he put it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The general alternative to such reductionism is a concept of hierarchy--a world constructed not as a smooth and seamless continuum, permitting simple extrapolation from the lowest level to the highest, but as a series of ascending levels, each bound to the one below it in some ways and independent in others.  Discontinuities and seams characterize the transitions; "emergent" features not implicit in the operation of proceses at lower levels, may control events at higher levels.  The basic processes--mutation, selection, etc.--may enter into explanations at all scales (and in that sense we may still hope for a general theory of evolution), but they work in different ways on the characteristic material at divers[e] levels &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.121].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He then gives an example from the molecular level, including the notion of gene regulation (versus purely reductionistic genetics), repetitive DNA, transposable elements, and developmental regulatory genes of large effect.  Thus, he says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We may find, for example, that structural gene substitutions control most small-scale, adaptive variation within local populations, while disruption of regulation lies behind most key innovations in macroevolution. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.121].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He concludes this section by noting:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The modern synthesis drew most of its direct conclusions from studies of local populations and their immediate adaptations.  It then extrapolated the postulated mechanism of these adaptations--gradual, allelic substitution--to encompass all larger-scale events.  The synthesis is now breaking down on both sides of this argument.  Many evolutionists now doubt exclusive control by selection upon genetic change within local populations.  Moreover, even if local populations alter as the synthesis maintains, we now doubt that the same style of change controls events at the two major higher levels: speciation and patterns of macroevolution. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.121].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The importance of structural mutations versus regulatory mutations is a topic of substantial debate in current evolutionary biology, so I think Gould was on the mark here.  We also have learned a lot more about the nature of eukaryote genomes, which are far more complex than Gould imagined nearly 30 years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;III. A Note on Local Populations and Neutrality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this section, Gould takes a brief detour to emphasize the importance of neutral change at the molecular level--something that was largely lost from the Modern Synthesis as it grew to strongly emphasize selection.  He begins by noting that there is more genetic variation in populations than was expected by the Modern Synthesis.  One reason is that frequency dependent selection or selection in response to mildly fluctuating environments can maintain polymorphisms (versus directional or stabilizing selection, which both eliminate variation).  More importantly, he argues that this reflects a much stronger than anticipated role for genetic drift and the predominance of neutral mutations.  Again, he does not take this as a reason to overthrow all aspects of the synthesis:&lt;blockquote&gt;None of this evidence, of course, negates the role of conventional selection and adaptation in molding parts of the phenotype with obvious importance for survival and reproduction.  Still, it rather damps Mayr's enthusiastic claim for "all evolution ... guided by natural selection".  The question, as with so many issues in the complex science of natural history, becomes one of relative frequency.  Are the Darwinian substitutions merely a surface skin on a sea of variation invisible to selection, or are the neutral substitutions merely a thin bottom layer underlying a Darwinian ocean above?  Or where in between? &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.122].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In summary, neutral processes are not a challenge to the importance of Darwinian adaptation, only to its exclusivity.  Acknowledging a large role for neutral processes at the molecular and population levels would challenge the Modern Synthesis to the extent that it is based on an assumption that selection is the dominant mechanism at all scales and that chance enters only at the level of providing small mutations on which selection may act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;IV.  The Level of Selection and the Goldschmidt Break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gould begins this section by noting that speciation usually cannot be observed or replicated in the lab, and that therefore models of speciation are typically based on analogy and inference.  He points out that Darwin drew an analogy with domestication, and considered subspecies as incipient species that gradually evolve into species through natural selection.  Mayr's allopatric speciation model challenged this, of course, but Gould suggests that it still maintained two major principles based on smooth extrapolationism:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(i) The accumulating changes that lead to speciation are adaptive.  Reproductive isolation is a consequence of sufficient accumulation.  (ii) Although aided by founder effects and even (possibly) by drift, although dependent upon isolation from gene flow, although proceeding more rapidly than local differentiation within large populations, successful speciation is still a cumulative and sequential process powered by selection through large numbers of generations.  It is, if you will, Darwinism a little faster. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.122].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gould then notes, "I do not doubt that many species originate in this way; but it now seems that many, perhaps most, do not."  He argues that several new (in 1980) models of speciation challenge the extrapolationist explanation.  Some of these involve major chromosomal changes.  I believe this is why he is often accused of proposing punctuated equilibria as a saltationist theory, but then of retreating when he was critcized for this view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gould's list of challenges to "allopatric orthodoxy" relate to the amount of gene flow within species and especially to the plausibility of sympatric speciation.  He argues that the assumption that gene flow homogenizes large populations (thereby making isolation necessary) may not be valid, and that instead local demes may be distinct enough for speciation. If that is the case, then the distinction between allopatric and sympatric speciation is oversimplified and sympatric speciation is much more likely than acknowledged.  Strong selection or the rapid fixation of major chromosomal variations could underlie such processes.  Here is where Gould first talks about rapid chromosome-level isolation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The most exciting entry among punctuational models for speciation in ecological time is the emphasis, now coming from several quarters, on chromosomal alterations as isolating mechanisms--sometimes called chromosomal speciation.  In certain population structures, particularly in very small and circumscribed groups with high degrees of inbreeding, major chromosomal changes can rise to fixation in less than a handful of generations &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.123].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He uses the word "punctuational", but he does not mention "punctuated equilibria" at all or cite any of his paper on the subject, and indeed what he is describing -- mechanisms of rapid &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;sympatric&lt;/span&gt; speciation -- has little to do with punctuated equilibria, which is about peripheral isolates.  As far as saltational mechanisms are concerned, their challenge to orthodoxy is that they undermine the emphasis on selection acting on small mutations as the dominant mechanism. He continues:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The control of evolution by selection leading to adaptation lies at the heart of the modern synthesis.  Thus, reproductive isolation, the definition of speciation, is attained as a by-product of adaptation--that is, a population diverges by sequential adaptation and eventually becomes sufficiently different from its ancestor to foreclose interbreeding ... But in saltational, chromosomal speciation, reproductive isolation comes first and cannot be considered as an adaptation at all.  It is a stochastic event that establishes a species by the technical definition of reproductive isolation.  To be sure, the later success of this species in competition may depend upon its subsequent acquisition of adaptations; but the origin itself may be non-adaptive.  We can, in fact, reverse the conventional view and argue that speciation, by forming new entities stochastically, provides raw material for evolution. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.124].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gould then notes that Richard Goldschmidt argued, while the synthesis was being constructed, that there is a break between what happens in populations and what happens when new species originate.  He calls this the "Goldschmidt break".   Gould ends this section by quoting Goldschmidt (1940), though not in relation to any particular ideas about mutation or saltationism, only to say that extrapolation from short-term population processes is not enough to explain all speciation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The characters of subspecies are of a gradient type, the species limit is characterized by a gap, an unbridged difference in many characters.  This gap cannot be bridged by theoretically continuing the subspecific gradient or cline beyond its actually existing limits.  The subspecies do not merge into the species either actually or ideally ... Microevolution by accumulation of micromutations--we may also say neo-Darwinian evolution--is a process which leads to diversification strictly within the species, usually, if not exclusively, for the sake of adaptation of the species to specific conditions within the area which it is able to occupy ... Subspecies are actually, therefore, neither incipient species nor models for the origin of species.  They are more or less diversified blind alleys within the species.  The decisive step in evolution, the first step towards macroevolution, the step from one species to another, requires another evolutionary method than that of the sheer accumulation of micromutations. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Goldschmidt 1940, p.183].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One can certainly disagree with Goldschmidt that subspecies are never incipient species, or with Gould for quoting this, but one cannot argue that Gould endorsed Goldschmidt's particular genetic views nor linked these to punctuated equilibria in any way in this section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;V. Macroevolution and the Wright Break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this section, Gould moves from mechanisms of speciation to large-scale macroevolutionary trends.  He opens by summarizing the interpretation of macroevolutionary patterns given by the Modern Synthesis, namely that they occur gradually and with branching as an afterthought (i.e., cladogenesis subordinate to anagenesis).  Moreover, most of this gradual transformation is an adaptive outcome of population-level selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gould presents several counterpoints to this extrapolationist model.  First, he notes that models of speciation emphasizing branching and stasis suggest that higher-level trends may actually result from sorting at the species level rather than as an extension of selection at the population level.  This is where punctuated equilibria comes in, and I think it is worth noting that he does not link this to saltational mechanisms.  In fact, he explicitly notes that any model of speciation that emphasized comparatively rapid speciation followed by stasis would have the same implications:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We regard stasis and discontinuity as an expression of how evolution works when translated into geological time.  Large, successful central populations undergo minor adaptive modifications of fluctuating effect through time (Goldschmidt's "diversified blind alleys"), but they will rarely transform&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; in toto&lt;/span&gt; to somethign fundamentally new.  Gradual change is not the normal state of a species.  Speciation, the basis of macroevolution, is a process of branching.  And this branching, under any current model of speciation--conventional allopatry to chromosomal saltation--is so rapid in geological translation (thousands of years at most compared with millions for the duration of most fossil species) that its results should generally lie on a bedding plane, not through the thick sedimentary sequence of a long hillslope.  (The expectation of gradualism emerges as a kind of double illusion.  It represents, first of all, an incorrect translation of conventional allopatry.  Allopatric speciation seems so slow and gradual in ecological time that most paleontologists never recognized it as a challenge to the style of gradualism--steady change over millions of years--promulgated by custom as a model for the history of life.  But it now appears that "slow" allopatry itself may be less important than a host of alternatives that yield new species rapidly even in ecological time).  Thus, our model of "punctuated equilibria" holds that evolution is concentrated in events of speciation and that successful speciation is an infrequent event punctuating the statis of large populations that do not alter in fundamental ways during the millions of years that they endure. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.125].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Again, the main point is that trends at the macroevolutionary scale may represent the outcome of differential survival and reproduction (speciation) of species.  This would make macroevolutionary trends at least partly distinct from microevolutionary processes.  Gould notes that Sewall Wright emphasized this, which is why he calls this the "Wright break".   This is the one place that punctuated equilibria is discussed, specifically in light of its implications for species selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second major issue that Gould then raises is that sometimes "saltational" changes probably do happen.  Not at the level of normal speciation events, but in major innovations.  (Again, this would have nothing to do with punctuated equilibria, which is strictly about the patterns of speciation).  He also does not mean that whole new structures appear suddenly.  As he explains:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not refer to the saltational origin of entire new designs, complete in all their complex and integrated features--a fantasy that would be truly anti-Darwinian in denying any creativity to selection and relegating it to the role of eliminating old models.  Instead, I envisage a potential saltational origin for the essential features of key adaptations. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.127].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In general, this sort of "saltation" would involve major developmental changes that could be caused by small mutations of regulatory genes.  Gould rejects Goldschmidt's hypothesis of "systemic mutations", but suggests that developmental regulatory mutations could sometimes lead to the saltational origin of basic forms of new features.  This is a topic that is widely discussed today, so again, I think Gould was basically right to raise this point.  In fact, the example he gives is of the origin of the jaw from gill arches, which he argues could have been "saltational" in the sense that it occurred quickly through a developmental mutation.  Interestingly, a recent paper by Shigetani et al. (2002) suggests that this transition did indeed involve a developmental mutation, specifically a heterotopic shift in gene expression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third major challenge to extrapolationism in explaining macroevolutionary patterns that Gould presents has to do with non-adaptive processes.  This follows from his classic paper with Richard Lewontin, published the year before (Gould and Lewontin 1979).  Here, he revisits the points about there being more variation in populations than adaptationist models should expect, and that speciation by chromosomal mechanisms could be non-adaptive.  He then moves on to discuss the relevance of large-scale trends that are not caused by population-level selection.  As he says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... if trends represent a higher-level process of differential origin and mortality among species, then a suite of potentially non-adaptive explanations must be considered.  Trends, for example, may occur because some kinds of species tend to speciate more often than others.  This tendency may reside in the character of environments or in attributes of behavior and population structure bearing no relationship to morphologies that spread through lineages as a result of higher speciation rates among some of their members.  Or trends may arise from the greater longevity of certain kinds of species. Again, this greater persistence may have little to do with the morphologies that come to prevail as a result. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.128].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The point, yet again, is that the Modern Synthesis as described by Mayr -- which emphasized gradual, adaptive change as the cause of macroevolution -- is undermined by other processes at both higher and lower levels.  Gould is not arguing that the synthesis is incorrect or that it needs to be overthrown, only that it is unduly narrow and needs to be expanded.  Many of the issues he raises here are still under debate, though they are still dismissed by some who argue that the synthesis is more or less complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;VI. Quo Vadis?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this concluding section, Gould is clear about what he is arguing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I think I can see what is breaking down in evolutionary theory--the strict construction of the modern synthesis with its belief in pervasive adaptation, gradualism, and extrapolation by smooth continuity from causes of change in local populations to major trends and transitions in the history of life. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[Gould 1980, p.128].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here is what he sees as the features of a revised evolutionary theory:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will be hierarchical in nature.  This doesn't mean that each level is totally disconnected, only that we will have to recognize the operation of (similar) mechanisms at each level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will include punctuational patterns at all levels, not only gradual change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will emphasize the role of constraints in shaping phenotypes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will properly recognize the input of non-adaptive processes at all levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It will link insights from paleontology, developmental genetics, and molecular biology with those derived from population studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Overall, the paper seems quite mild in retrospect.  Gould did not call for a revolution in evolutionary biology, nor did he transform punctuated equilibria into a fundamentally radical mode of speciation.  He merely argued against the features of the Modern Synthesis that its proponents themselves outlined.  Many of the arguments he raised were ahead of their time but are now common in evolutionary discourse.  This is especially true given the enormous growth of biological information in the nearly three decades since this paper was published.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlesworth, B., R.

Or, it was years ago since you heard that and now your child, after making her way through preschool, kindergarten, elementary school and even middle school, is just not able to cope in the too big wide chaos of high school and starts to fall apart and you think, frantically, what can I do, I have to do something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever it costs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said it myself that I'd "pay anything to help my child" and Jim and I have written our share of cheques (and continue to write some, though not quite as many as when Charlie was younger). The hard part is figuring out, what therapies to try and with which therapists? Does a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_price_is_right_but_is_the_therapy_worth_it"&gt;higher price tag&lt;/a&gt; necessarily mean better therapies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No and yes, yes and no. Many of us raised an eyebrow about the $20,000 cost for one week of therapy from &lt;a href="http://www.autismpartnership.com/"&gt;Autism Partnership&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_long_haul_on_autism_911"&gt;13-year-old in southern California&lt;/a&gt;. In Australia, the &lt;a href="http://www.senews.com.au/story/70311"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt; reports that, according to a local autism charity, families and taxpayers are being "ripped off by a disability service provider in the western suburbs." Under the government's "&lt;a href="http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/school_education/programmes_funding/programme_categories/special_needs_disadvantage/helping_children_autism/" title="Helping Children with Autism"&gt;Helping Children with Autism Package&lt;/a&gt;," families had a choice of only one service provider who charged up to twice as much as other providers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The government has these approved service providers which means that we can’t go out and pay for private services,” Mr [Chris] Saunders [of Autism Angels] said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And we’re not talking about alternative therapies, crystal therapy, dolphin therapy – I currently pay for a speech therapist out of my own pocket because the approved provider out here charges double the amount of most others that you’ll find in the market at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(One has to wonder what the rates for the three "alternate" therapies mentioned would add to the bill.......)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The February 15th &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25057163-601,00.html"&gt;Australian&lt;/a&gt; also notes that a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/manipulated_data_behind_mmr-autism_controversy"&gt;certain doctor connected with the MMR controversy&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25057163-601,00.html"&gt;well-provided for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While the LHC is still fixing itself after last fall’s explosions, the Tevatron has been collecting data like mad, and hopes to continue for another couple of years.  At the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7893689.stm"&gt;Fermilab scientists said&lt;/a&gt; they have quite a good shot at collecting “evidence for” (although not quite “discovery of”) the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/11/06/higgs-101/"&gt;Higgs boson&lt;/a&gt; before all is said and done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.uslhc.us/?p=866"&gt;Adam Yurkewicz&lt;/a&gt; at US/LHC Blogs has the scoop, and you should go there for more info.  But this graph tells the basic story.  It’s the probability that Fermilab will be able to find “three-sigma” evidence for the Higgs, depending on what its mass is, if the Tevatron gets to run through 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/chance-of-higgs-discovery-at-tevatron-large.jpg" width="600" alt="chance-of-higgs-discovery-at-tevatron-large.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to complicated background events, finding a particle like the Higgs isn’t just a matter of smacking together protons and antiprotons at higher and higher energies.  Some possible values of the Higgs mass make it easier to find than others, since the reactions that produce it aren’t as swamped by boring known events.  That’s why the Tevatron has a shot, even if LHC opens with substantially larger energies later this year.  The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7893689.stm"&gt;BBC story&lt;/a&gt; portrays the whole thing as a race, which is fine, but to the rest of the world it’s more important to just find the darn thing than which continent gets there first.  (Given that the Higgs is a boson, the smart money would seem to be on &lt;a href="http://resonaances.blogspot.com/2008/05/paulis-other-principle.html"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004497" title=""&gt;Respiratory Evolution Facilitated the Origin of Pterosaur Flight and Aerial Gigantism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pterosaurs, enigmatic extinct Mesozoic reptiles, were the first vertebrates to achieve true flapping flight. Various lines of evidence provide strong support for highly efficient wing design, control, and flight capabilities. However, little is known of the pulmonary system that powered flight in pterosaurs. We investigated the structure and function of the pterosaurian breathing apparatus through a broad scale comparative study of respiratory structure and function in living and extinct archosaurs, using computer-assisted tomographic (CT) scanning of pterosaur and bird skeletal remains, cineradiographic (X-ray film) studies of the skeletal breathing pump in extant birds and alligators, and study of skeletal structure in historic fossil specimens. In this report we present various lines of skeletal evidence that indicate that pterosaurs had a highly effective flow-through respiratory system, capable of sustaining powered flight, predating the appearance of an analogous breathing system in birds by approximately seventy million years. Convergent evolution of gigantism in several Cretaceous pterosaur lineages was made possible through body density reduction by expansion of the pulmonary air sac system throughout the trunk and the distal limb girdle skeleton, highlighting the importance of respiratory adaptations in pterosaur evolution, and the dramatic effect of the release of physical constraints on morphological diversification and evolutionary radiation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004472" title=""&gt;The Maintenance of Traditions in Marmosets: Individual Habit, Not Social Conformity? A Field Experiment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Social conformity is a cornerstone of human culture because it accelerates and maintains the spread of behaviour within a group. Few empirical studies have investigated the role of social conformity in the maintenance of traditions despite an increasing body of literature on the formation of behavioural patterns in non-human animals. The current report presents a field experiment with free-ranging marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) which investigated whether social conformity is necessary for the maintenance of behavioural patterns within groups or whether individual effects such as habit formation would suffice. Using a two-action apparatus, we established alternative behavioural patterns in six family groups composed of 36 individuals. These groups experienced only one technique during a training phase and were thereafter tested with two techniques available. The monkeys reliably maintained the trained method over a period of three weeks, despite discovering the alternative technique. Three additional groups were given the same number of sessions, but those 21 individuals could freely choose the method to obtain a reward. In these control groups, an overall bias towards one of the two methods was observed, but animals with a different preference did not adjust towards the group norm. Thirteen of the fifteen animals that discovered both techniques remained with the action with which they were initially successful, independent of the group preference and the type of action (Binomial test: exp. proportion: 0.5, p&amp;lt;0.01). The results indicate that the maintenance of behavioural patterns within groups 1) could be explained by the first rewarded manipulation and subsequent habit formation and 2) do not require social conformity as a mechanism. After an initial spread of a behaviour throughout a group, this mechanism may lead to a superficial appearance of conformity without the involvement of such a socially and cognitively complex mechanism. This is the first time that such an experiment has been conducted with free-ranging primates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004460" title=""&gt;Estimating Genetic Ancestry Proportions from Faces&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ethnicity can be a means by which people identify themselves and others. This type of identification mediates many kinds of social interactions and may reflect adaptations to a long history of group living in humans. Recent admixture in the US between groups from different continents, and the historically strong emphasis on phenotypic differences between members of these groups, presents an opportunity to examine the degree of concordance between estimates of group membership based on genetic markers and on visually-based estimates of facial features. We first measured the degree of Native American, European, African and East Asian genetic admixture in a sample of 14 self-identified Hispanic individuals, chosen to cover a broad range of Native American and European genetic admixture proportions. We showed frontal and side-view photographs of the 14 individuals to 241 subjects living in New Mexico, and asked them to estimate the degree of NA admixture for each individual. We assess the overall concordance for each observer based on an aggregated measure of the difference between the observer and the genetic estimates. We find that observers reach a significantly higher degree of concordance than expected by chance, and that the degree of concordance as well as the direction of the discrepancy in estimates differs based on the ethnicity of the observer, but not on the observers' age or sex. This study highlights the potentially high degree of discordance between physical appearance and genetic measures of ethnicity, as well as how perceptions of ethnic affiliation are context-specific. We compare our findings to those of previous studies and discuss their implications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004462" title=""&gt;Short Lag Times for Invasive Tropical Plants: Evidence from Experimental Plantings in Hawai'i&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The lag time of an invasion is the delay between arrival of an introduced species and its successful spread in a new area. To date, most estimates of lag times for plants have been indirect or anecdotal, and these estimates suggest that plant invasions are often characterized by lag times of 50 years or more. No general estimates are available of lag times for tropical plant invasions. Historical plantings and documentation were used to directly estimate lag times for tropical plant invasions in Hawai'i. Historical planting records for the Lyon Arboretum dating back to 1920 were examined to identify plants that have since become invasive pests in the Hawaiian Islands. Annual reports describing escape from plantings were then used to determine the lag times between initial plantings and earliest recorded spread of the successful invaders. Among 23 species that eventually became invasive pests, the average lag time between introduction and first evidence of spread was 14 years for woody plants and 5 years for herbaceous plants. These direct estimates of lag times are as much as an order of magnitude shorter than previous, indirect estimates, which were mainly based on temperate plants. Tropical invaders may have much shorter lag times than temperate species. A lack of direct and deliberate observations may have also inflated many previous lag time estimates. Although there have been documented cases of long lag times due to delayed arrival of a mutualist or environmental changes over time, this study suggests that most successful invasions are likely to begin shortly after arrival of the plant in a suitable habitat, at least in tropical environments. Short lag times suggest that controlled field trials may be a practical element of risk assessment for plant introductions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as you entrust your travel to a Boeing 747 rather than a magic carpet or a broomstick; just as you take your tumour to the best surgeon available, rather than a shaman or a mundu mugu, so you will find that the scientific version of truth works. You can use it to navigate through the real world. Science predicts, with complete certainty unless the end of the world intervenes, that the city of Shanghai will experience a total eclipse of the sun on July 22, 2009. Theories about the moon god devouring the sun god may be poetic, and they may cohere with other aspects of a tribe’s world view, but they won’t predict the date, time and place of an eclipse. Science will, and with an accuracy you could set your watch by. Science gets you to the moon and back. Even if we bend over backwards to concede that scientific truth is no more than that which enables you to pilot your way reliably, safely and predictably around the real universe, it is in exactly this sense that - at the very least - evolution is true. Evolutionary theory pilots us around biology reliably and predictively, with a detailed and unblemished success that rivals anything in science. The least you can say about evolutionary theory is that it works. All but pedants would go further and assert that it is true.… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution is true in whatever sense you accept it as true that New Zealand is in the Southern Hemisphere. If we refused ever to use a word like “true”, how could we conduct our day-to-day conversations? Or fill in a census form: “What is your sex?” “The hypothesis that I am male has not so far been falsified, but let me just check again”. As Douglas Adams might have said, it doesn’t read well. Yet the philosophy that imposes such scruples on science has no basis for absolving everyday facts from the same circumlocution. It is in this sense that evolution is true - provided, of course, that the scientific evidence for it is strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That list is not as long as perhaps we'd like to see.  Does anyone know of programs to add to the list, perhaps new ones that have been started?  Does anyone want to start an autism program at your local university? ;-P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My university does not have an autism program.  In fact, disability services at my university is so bad and autie-unfriendly that the school has a reputation as one to specifically avoid if you are on the spectrum.  Why, one might ask, do I attend it?  Because it's one of the only schools in the nation that gives a degree in my primary Interest.  Alas.  At least my professors are understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More colleges could perhaps do better in terms of providing programs for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/phil_plait_the_bad_astronomer/"&gt;I did an interview with him&lt;/a&gt; back in April 2007 for PoI. What I just discovered is that someone going by the name &amp;quot;skepticasts&amp;quot; on YouTube &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvHP-aPV3I"&gt;has created a four-part video&lt;/a&gt; using still images overlaying the audio track of the interview. You might get a kick out of them, and the images he chose. &lt;/p&gt;

According to the woman, the man initially brought her to his home after she told him she had nowhere to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman told police that after she fell asleep Brisport handcuffed her wrists and ankles, gagged her, undressed her and put her in an adult diaper, then read Bible passages, said police Capt. Ray Carroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She apparently was not sexually assaulted, Carroll said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, court documents alleged that Brisport tried several times to suffocate the woman using a pillow and blanket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She managed to escape while the man was asleep and was found by police dressed only in a T-shirt and the adult diaper and still wearing handcuffs.&lt;/p&gt;

That gives you a more dramatic piece of footage than otherwise, but the results are similar.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a bird got swept into the engine of Flight 1549 out of NYC in January, &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090115/ap_on_re_us/plane_in_river"&gt;the plane went down&lt;/a&gt;. How could a bird do that to a plane engine, you might ask? Well, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-8_Gnbp2JA"&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt; to find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, the fans inside a jet spin very rapidly, and are under a fantastic amount of stress. Poke them hard enough, and &lt;strong&gt;kablam&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was, &amp;quot;Why this doesn’t happen more often?&amp;quot; but then I realized that birds actually don’t take up a lot of space compared to the volume of space a plane uses, and probably stay away from airports because of noise. I suspect that’s a good thing. [Update: BABloggee &amp;quot;Grey Wolf&amp;quot; informs me it is indeed a problem. &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/03/0325_030325_falconry.html"&gt;The FAA spends as much as &lt;em&gt;half a billion dollars per year&lt;/em&gt; on this&lt;/a&gt;!

Most of it is pretty darned good; he's writing as "an intelligent, curious person who years ago became fascinated by the Theory of Evolution because of its magnificence, its beauty, and its self-evident truth", not as a biologist, and I think that is an important perspective. You don't have to have a Ph.D. in Abstract Biological Esoterica to appreciate evidence and reason and the elegance of evolution! This is one of the reasons I oppose religion so vehemently: I am optimistic that most people are entirely capable of grasping the principles of good science, but that what we have in our culture right now is an explicit ideological barrier that hampers understanding. I've said it over and over that most creationists are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; stupid people, they simply have this unfortunate indoctrination in a weird belief that their beloved children will be imperiled for all eternity if someone shows them a shell that is more than 6000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So read Ebert&amp;#39;s article, it&amp;#39;s good, it expresses considerable common sense. However, you know me — there are bits that provoke me to draw out the razor-edged claymore of angry scientist and start slashing indiscriminately. Stand back, I have a blade and I don&amp;#39;t care how wildly I use it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebert has to have a section in which he tries to gently chide atheists, and I will not be chidden. In particular, he has a list of points he makes in these kinds of arguments, and one is a special bête noir for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science has no opinion on religion.&lt;/b&gt; It cannot. Science deals with that which can be studied or inferred by observation, measurement, and experiment. Religious belief is outside its purview, except in such social sciences as sociology, anthropology, and psychology, where even then not the validity of the beliefs but their effects are studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I&amp;#39;ll sheathe the sword for a bit. I hear this argument so often that I mainly feel disappointed when someone drags it out anymore — especially when I can agree that that person is &amp;quot;intelligent and curious&amp;quot;. The premise that science can&amp;#39;t have a stance on the validity of a religion is like the tranquilizer dart of the debates with religion; someone is thinking and questioning, and suddenly, swooosh, thock, ouch…they hear this argument that you can&amp;#39;t question the premises of religion, they get all sleepy and soporified, nod a few times, and piously agree. Gould succumbed to this, too, and here&amp;#39;s Roger Ebert, hit by the same dart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WAKE UP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Think&lt;/i&gt; about it. Why can't science address the existence of gods? Why should we simply sit back and accept the claim of apologists that what they believe in is not subject to "observation, measurement, and experiment"?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States today, we have tens of thousands of priests, rabbis, mullahs, pastors, and preachers who are &lt;i&gt;paid professionals&lt;/i&gt;, who claim to be active and functioning mediators between people and omnipotent invisible masters of the universe. They make specific claims about their god's nature, what he's made of and what he isn't, how he thinks and acts, what &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; should do to propitiate it…they somehow seem to have amazingly detailed information about this being. Yet, when a scientist approaches with a critical eye, suddenly it is a creature that not only has never been observed, but cannot observed, and its actions invisible, impalpible, and immaterial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where did these confident promoters of god-business get their information?  Shouldn't they be admitting that their knowledge of this elusive cosmic beast is nonexistent? It seems to me that if you're going to declare scientists helpless before the absence and irrelevance of the gods, you ought to declare likewise for all of god's translators and interpreters. Be consistent when you announce who has purview over all religious belief, because making god unobservable and immeasurable makes &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; incapable of saying anything at all about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what of those many millions of ordinary people who claim to have daily conversations with this entity? That is an impressive conduit for all kinds of testable information: a high bandwidth channel between the majority of people on Earth and a friendly, omniscient source of knowledge, and it isn&amp;#39;t named Google.  All these queries, and all these answers, and yet, somehow, none of these answers have enough meaning or significance to represent a testable body of counsel. Amazing! You would think that in all that volume of communication, some tiny percentage of useful information would emerge that we could assess against reality, but no…the theologians, lay and professional alike, will all claim that no usable data can be produced that would satisfy a scientist looking for sense. It sounds like empty noise to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the supposed histories of these believers, and they are full of material actions. Gods throw lightning bolts to smite unbelievers, annihilate whole cities and nations, raise the dead, slay whole worlds of people, suspend the laws of physics to halt the sun in the sky, create the whole Earth in less than a week, help footballers score goals, and even manifest themselves in physical bodies and walk about, doing amazing magic tricks. Wow, O Lord, please do vaporize a city with a column of holy fire before my eyes — I can observe that, I can measure that, I can even do experiments with the rubble. I will be really impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, but wait: it can only be an &lt;i&gt;unobservable, undetectable&lt;/i&gt; exercise in mass destruction? And he's not doing that sort of thing anymore? How about pulling a rabbit out of this hat? No, sorry, all done. God can't do anything anymore where people might actually notice, or worse, record the act and figure out how the tricks are done. This is awfully convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the "Science has no opinion on religion" argument leads us: to an atheist's world, where there are no activities by a god that matter, where at best people can claim that their god is aloof and unknowable, admitting in their own premises that they have no knowledge at all of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can accept that, as long as these people are aware of the import of what they are actually saying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/effectively_non-existent.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ngzx25LOVOM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234895744651"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4834546316961661203">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/90b9cade3de996ff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Why Are Women Religious?</title><published>2009-02-17T18:30:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T18:34:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/why-are-women-religious.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4834546316961661203/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4834546316961661203" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> At my talk last Friday I was asked about the field of evolutionary psychology.

For this reason, many biologists feel that the term "Darwinism" as shorthand for "modern evolutionary theory" is misleading historically and scientifically. Darwin got many things right, most notably the fact of common descent and the process of natural selection, but he did not -- and could not -- assemble a comprehensive theory of evolution based on what he knew at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One glaring gap in Darwin's brilliant writings, of course, was the total lack of information about the source of variation upon which natural selection acts.  Later, when Mendelian genetics was (re)discovered, this was thought by many geneticists to pose a challenge to the operation of natural selection.  Indeed, although Darwin had established the fact of evolution in his own time, his theory of natural selection did not take hold until decades later, and only after significant debate.  Other possible mechanisms, including orthogenesis, mutationism, and neo-Lamarckism, were favoured by many evolutionists in the early 1900s, and it was only after the "Modern Synthesis" of the 1930s and 1940s that these were rejected and Mendelian genetics and Darwinian natural selection were unified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as it is useful to consider what Darwin did not know, it is worth considering what was not yet known at the time of the "Modern Synthesis".  Here is a short list:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DNA is the hereditary material.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DNA has a double helix structure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein-coding genes use a triplet codon mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genes can be alternatively spliced to produce multiple protein products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the DNA in eukaryotic genomes is not genes.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even complex organisms like humans have a relatively small number of genes (~20K).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The majority of DNA in large genomes is transposable elements (genomic parasites).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genome duplications have occurred in many lineages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much (if not most) evolution at the molecular level is neutral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genes can be exchanged among even distantly related lineages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Development is regulated in part by a series of genes of major effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Species that look similar may be very different genetically.  Species that look very different may be very similar genetically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Differences in number of copies of genes may be an important source of variation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There have been several major mass extinctions over the past 600 million years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Survival through mass extinctions may be non-random, or at least may differ from survival of species during normal circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fossil data suggest that stasis is typical of many lineages, punctuated by relatively rapid speciation events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Natural selection operates at multiple levels, including within the genome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-genetic mechanisms (epigenetics) can influence development and be inherited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;There are two ways to consider this list.  One is to say that fitting these into the Modern Synthesis is not difficult, and that what we have thought about evolution since the 1940s is still pretty much correct and comprehensive.  The other is to have a conversation among experts from traditionally very disparate disciplines (genetics, genomics, developmental biology, paleontology) and ask: Do we need to expand our understanding of evolution to accommodate all of this new information?  &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/are-we-ready-for-an-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/"&gt;Jerry Coyne&lt;/a&gt; is one of the people who holds the first view, that everything is pretty much worked out -- these are just dots on i's and crosses on t's.  Not surprisingly, he is rather critical of those who are open to the second view.  Most recently, he has gone after &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1879213,00.html"&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; for writing this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;In the mid-1900s, biologists succeeded in merging the newest biological developments at the time into a new vision of evolution known as the Modern Synthesis. Today a number of biologists argue that it’s time for a new understanding of evolution, one that &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/"&gt;Pigliucci&lt;/a&gt; has called the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis. For now, they are fiercely debating every aspect of that synthesis–how important gene-swapping is to the course of evolution, for instance, and how gene networks get rewired to produce new traits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Some researchers argue that many patterns of nature–such as the large number of species in the tropics–cannot be reduced to the effect of natural selection on individuals. They may be following rules of their own. “Which of these ideas is going to actually survive and prove fruitful is anybody’s guess,” says Pigliucci. “I don’t see things coalescing for at least a decade or more.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Now, I tend to agree with Pigliucci on this point.  I spoke at a conference called "Extending the Synthesis" in Leiden a number of years ago along with paleontologists, a developmental biologist, an ecologist, and an experimental evolutionary biologist.  Pigliucci organized a &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2008/07/notes-from-altenberg-part-i.html"&gt;similar symposium&lt;/a&gt; (with some of the same individuals) more recently.  The point is that many people feel that we need to have a conversation about how well the "Modern Synthesis" covers these phenomena, and whether we need to expand it to include other components (say, non-genic sources of diversity, multi-level selection, or large-scale changes caused by developmental mutations).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be fair to Coyne, he is right that declaring a revolution with each new discovery is nonsense.  Much of the hype about epigenetics (especially &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/07/epigenetics-and-neo-neo-lamarckism.html"&gt;mis-labeling it as Lamarckian&lt;/a&gt;) falls into this category, in my view.  As he put it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We have surely gone way beyond Darwin in our understanding of the pattern and process of evolution. But I am irritated by the constant appearance of what I call “BIS”–the Big Idea Syndrome. An evolutionist finds a new phenomenon, say transposable elements, or epigenetics, or “modularity,” and suddenly that one phenomenon becomes the centerpiece of a claim that modern evolutionary theory is ripe for a revolution. Yet when you look for the beef, it isn’t there. Where are all the examples of genetic assimilation, a phenomenon that was said to completely overturn our views?&lt;/blockquote&gt;The point is that it's not one phenomenon.  It's phenomena from several very distant fields in evolutionary biology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I once encountered a similar sentiment from a reviewer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This paper exemplifies what might be called the "molecular geneticists' fallacy" about the causes of evolution – that knowing the details of the molecular basis of mutational variation will radically change our view of how evolution works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;My response is that knowing the genetic details may have little bearing on how one understands microevolution -- you can easily consider a genome duplication an "allele" -- but it can have major implications for understanding macroevolutionary phenomena (did the diversification of teleost fishes depend on a genome duplication event?).   That's the whole point.  We need to be willing to consider these phenomena from a variety of perspectives, not just population processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An extended synthesis would not involve an overthrow of current theory (hence, "extended").  It would represent an effort to incorporate as much of our new knowledge into existing theory as possible, but to expand any areas where mathematical models devised before the structure of DNA was known are not up to the job.  It's an exciting time, and I believe there really is a buzz in the air about where we will go in our next significant step in understanding how evolution operates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, Zimmer's summary of the current state of evolutionary biology is, in my opinion, on the mark.  Most people I know are interested in exploring what all of the new information we have come upon in the last couple of decades means for evolution.  I know only a few individuals who see the "Modern Synthesis" as needing little or no extending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;________________&lt;br&gt;UPDATES:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2009/02/jerry-coyne-and-extended-evolutionary.html"&gt;Massimo Pigliucci&lt;/a&gt;'s response.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/are-we-ready-for-an-extended-evolutionary-synthesis/"&gt;Coyne&lt;/a&gt; adds a bit in reply to Pigliucci (and seems to think "extending" and "revolution" are the same thing).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/4_av85M7BrA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234891176833"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/money_alone_is_not_enough_for_successful_services">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a5c25387e4e55d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Money Alone is Not Enough for Successful Services</title><published>2009-02-17T17:14:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T17:14:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/money_alone_is_not_enough_for_successful_services" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/175/413190693_b84a564f27_m.jpg" alt="close up on the exterior of a run down building with paint peeling, focus on the window; on the inside of the window, a sign with a question mark on it is posted" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/provider/providerarticle.aspx?feed=BWK&amp;amp;date=20090215&amp;amp;id=9609136"&gt;$500 million&lt;/a&gt; may have been put in the stimulus for &lt;a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/afi/afi360/455095_v1_-_Tab_3_VR_Fact_Sheet_Revised.html"&gt;Vocational Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;, but will that really help anyone with a disability get a job?  Money is only one piece of a successful service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure services need funding; for example, VR in my state has stopped accepting new clients for lack of funds.  Without the funding to actually provide a service, well, that's the end of that.  VR can't help someone with employment if they can't take that person as a client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't matter how much funding is available if the agency doesn't have the infrastructure, knowledge, or ethics to actually provide the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure: If the system is not set up to facilitate the service it's intended to deliver, then the service fails just as completely as if it didn't have any funding.  What good is VR finding someone a job if that person loses the supports they need &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/employment_first"&gt;to survive&lt;/a&gt;?  Are external impacts on the program considered and targeted, like &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/looking_to_light_dark_age_beliefs_about_workers_with_disabilities"&gt;employer beliefs&lt;/a&gt;? Does the agency focus so much on training that it has neglected competency at &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/rehabilitating_vocational_rehabilitation"&gt;job search&lt;/a&gt;?  Is the system broken anywhere structurally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge: Does the service system understand the clients enough to service them?  I don't just mean technical understanding of a disability category, but actually understanding individuals and the community.  Are service providers being trained with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/pragmatic_employment_practices_for_the_whole_spectrum"&gt;reliable, correct information&lt;/a&gt;?  Are they &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/accessing_academic_accommodations_an_interview_with_jennifer_parker"&gt;being trained at all&lt;/a&gt;?  Do they have sufficient training also on their own jobs and on what resources, both internal and external, are available to them and their clients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethics: &lt;a href="http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/"&gt;Joel Smith&lt;/a&gt; posted an excellent essay &lt;a href="http://thiswayoflife.org/blog/?p=369"&gt;It's not about money&lt;/a&gt; that discusses how real civil rights, for example equal access to education, are often lost in the bickering about the money.  Is more money for a service going to really put an end to atrocities perpetuated by people in that service, like staff abuse, or &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/maybe_that_is_what_you_need_to_do_to_teach_those_kids"&gt;Diana O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;?  Do we even want more money going to a system that lets that sort of thing happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I tend to support funding social programs, sometimes I step back and question: When might it be necessary to let a program die and replace it with a new program that functions better?  When are the problems with infrastructure impossible to fix without a new foundation?  When is ingorance so endemic that retraining needs to be undertaken on a global basis anyway?  When has a system become so puppeted by administrators and red tape that it has forgotten exactly who it was intended to serve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html"&gt;Obama's inauguration speech&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but whether it works, whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are enough resources being put into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation"&gt;program evaluation&lt;/a&gt;?  How do we know when it's better to start over?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234890960093"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_surgeon_visits_body_worlds.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3a7fe877f7417e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">A surgeon visits Body Worlds</title><published>2009-02-17T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/pwaBo85lZ5c/a_surgeon_visits_body_worlds.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_surgeon_visits_body_worlds.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Classic Insolence logo" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2006/08/ClassicInsolence.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, as we have been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/an_open_letter_to_seth_aronson_about_his.php"&gt;dreading&lt;/a&gt; for the last four months or so since her relapse was diagnosed, my mother-in-law passed away from breast cancer in hospice.

This post originally appeared in March 2006.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You may have noticed that I haven't been paying as close attention to the ol' blog as usual over the last three days, leading to a bit of hyperbole in the comments section of at least &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/the_ethics_of_vaccines.php"&gt;one post&lt;/a&gt; without my responding until today. Indeed, here's a secret: Most of the posts that have appeared since Friday were written Thursday or earlier and scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife happened to have some time off; so I took a rare three-day weekend off work. We took a road trip to Philadelphia to check out an exhibit at the &lt;a href="http://www.fi.edu/"&gt;Franklin Institute&lt;/a&gt; that we both had wanted to see before it left Philadelphia: Gunther von Hagens' &lt;a href="http://www.fi.edu/bodyworlds/index.html"&gt;Body Worlds&lt;/a&gt;. As a surgeon, I found it to be a fascinating experience, albeit a vaguely troubling one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_surgeon_visits_body_worlds.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_surgeon_visits_body_worlds.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/pwaBo85lZ5c" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234889885222"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/the_pumpkin_argument.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b50f6013fec90c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">The pumpkin argument</title><published>2009-02-17T16:36:15Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T16:36:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/RoTxteNcero/the_pumpkin_argument.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/the_pumpkin_argument.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Holbo has uncovered an old argument against atheists, one that might have oozed languidly from the fermenting brain of Ray Comfort. But no! This is from a 19th century book of poetry! I wouldn't be at all surprised if Ray steals it soon, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, it's an invented disagreement. An imaginary atheist argues that in a well-designed universe, large oak trees ought to bear pumpkin-sized fruit, while little ground-hugging shrubberies out to have acorn-sized fruit. This is easily dismissed by the poet by having an  &lt;a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2009/02/17/fool-had-that-bough-a-pumpkin-bore-or-the-problem-of-evil-solvd/"&gt;acorn fall on the atheist's head&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fool! had that bough a pumpkin bore,&lt;br&gt;
Thy whimseys would have work'd no more,&lt;br&gt;
Nor skull have kept them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It even has an illustration of a weeping atheist, which John thinks might look like me, back in my youth in 1792, when I hadn't grown the beard yet and was fond of tricorn hats, and was always being pelted with acorns by puritans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/the_pumpkin_argument.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/RoTxteNcero" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234888179162"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/17/bad-astronomy-picked-as-one-of-timecoms-25-best-blogs-of-2009/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a6a2d10144937a13</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Bad Astronomy picked as one of Time.com’s 25 Best Blogs of 2009</title><published>2009-02-17T15:47:13Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T15:47:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/17/bad-astronomy-picked-as-one-of-timecoms-25-best-blogs-of-2009/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="left"&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/time_bestblog2009.jpg" alt="Time Best Blog of 2009"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time.com has announced its picks for &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879276_1879279_1879074,00.html"&gt;Best Blogs of 2009&lt;/a&gt;, and I am very honored that Bad Astronomy — hey, that’s &lt;em&gt;here!&lt;/em&gt; — is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seemed to like the idea of a skeptical blog, which is probably what I like most about what they wrote. It’s very gratifying indeed to know that people out there appreciate a reality-based opinion. One of my overarching goals is to avoid dogma and bias and use only factual evidence on which to base my opinions. I know some people will disagree with this, but in general I think that’s because they don’t like the conclusions I reach. But I have found over the years that the hardest thing to accept as a skeptic is that the Universe doesn’t care what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; is true, it only cares about what &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a big difference, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m thrilled and honored to be on the Time.com list, especially with such great company like &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879276_1879279_1879293,00.html"&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879276_1879279_1879287,00.html"&gt;Metafilter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879276_1879279_1879285,00.html"&gt;Life Hacker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879276_1879279_1879302,00.html"&gt;Mashable&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1879276_1879279_1879064,00.html"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.

It also looks very familiar, with the same dead arguments and the same old delusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also get new twists on old tropes. Remember the horrible &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/new_scientist_says_darwin_was.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt; cover&lt;/a&gt; that we knew was going to be abused by the creationists? It is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am guided ultimately by the parameters that the Bible lays down," admits John Peet, travelling secretary of the Biblical Creation Society. He estimates that 90% of the congregation at the Chertsey Street baptist church in Guildford, where he worships and where I hear him address the "creation club", are young earthers. The theme of pastor John Benton's sermon in the evening is "Genesis and Evolution: Do They Fit Together?" He holds up a recent New Scientist cover, headlined "Darwin was wrong," as evidence that the scientific base for evolution is crumbling, that the Darwinian tree of life can be uprooted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got my copy of that issue, and you dedicated warriors against creationism might want to pick one up soon. One simple strategy to counter that nonsense is to ask if they read anything more than the title, so that you can open it up and show that they are lying about the science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That cover was a mistake, and it is one more headache for us to deal with it…but as we all know, creationists will misuse &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; to suit their agenda. They (and also, unfortunately, many defenders of evolution) like to blame atheism for creationism, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay, too, is clutching a copy of that issue of New Scientist when I meet him. This is manna from heaven - the science establishment offering up gifts to the creationists. They also claim that the aggression of the new atheists is helping them. They paint Dawkins as a "recruiting sergeant" for creationism because he links evolutionary thinking with atheism. "He has been a real help to the ministry, " says Randall Hardy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Creationists argue that the new atheists are fuelling the dogmatism; Richard Harries, the former Bishop of Oxford and a theistic evolutionary, last week threw that accusation back at them. "Creationists totally misunderstand the Bible," he said. "Genesis is in the business of story, myth, poetry, metaphor. They [creationists and atheists] feed off one another. The debate has an unreality about it. Those of us who are not fundamentalists can't find a place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atheism and evolution are linked because science provides an evidence-based, rational account of origins that makes the myths of faith superfluous. If the fact that many scientists have abandoned the crutch of religion makes you flee from reason to embrace the absurdities of the creationists, you weren't a friend of science in the first place. These are people who claim the existence of a cure makes them love their disease all the more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Mr Harries, I can understand how he can&amp;#39;t find a place — he&amp;#39;s got nothing but vapor wafted about by furiously waving hands to stand upon. Of course the book of Genesis is a pile of metaphor and myth — so is the whole freaking Bible. But a metaphor &lt;i&gt;for what&lt;/i&gt;? It&amp;#39;s all very nice to stagger away from the literalist interpretation of the bible — I sympathize, it&amp;#39;s what we atheists have all done — but then we&amp;#39;re left with this curious pile of pages that is a collection of &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; badly done history, bizarre behavioral proscriptions, uneven poetry, unbelievable fairy tales, and utterly insane politics and prophecy, which people believe fervently and which, even among those apologists who excuse it as mere "metaphor", is endorsed as a guide to moral behavior and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he finds the debate unreal, think how we people free of the god delusion see it: a minority of lunatics espousing the kinds of silliness described in the Guardian article, which is hard enough for us to believe, with a majority of gawping fish on the sidelines trying desperately to avoid any association with the creationist kooks while averting their eyes from the rational people fighting their battles for them because they know, deep down, that their feeble apologetics for a "metaphor" they believe in makes the bewildered middle-of-the-roaders just as ridiculous as the creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

This has a couple of implications for this blog. First, I will not be posting as many entries. Tomorrow I have a post at Science Based Medicine, and then my next post here will be Friday. Next week I will be back to my usual schedule. I also will not be able to moderate comments as often - so be patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news is that I am vacationing in Florida and took the opportunity to visit James Randi at the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;JREF&lt;/a&gt; headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first visit to the JREF. The physical space is humble but comfortable and functional in a scholarly sort-of way - pretty much what you would expect from such an organization. The most impressive aspect was the skeptical library, which holds over 3000 books - impeccably indexed. Randi has been the recipient of many old tomes over the years, some of which were evident on the shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course the reason our reason for visiting the JREF (I was there with my brothers and fellow podcasters, Jay and Bob) was to visit with the man himself. Randi was kind to sit with us for a couple of hours and chew the skeptical fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randi is a hugely impressive man in a small frame. At 80 he is still energetic and engaging. His mind is filled with seemingly endless anecdotes about his adventures and investigations, as well as all the friends he made over the years. I felt like we could have sat and chatted for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the while he was still busy at his craft - working on his latest book (on fairies), preparing for yet another trip, and dealing with other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what most impresses me about Randi is his never-ending love for science and knowledge.  His eyes still managed to twinkle as he told us about a new bit of fascinating knowledge he came by, or demonstrated a mentalist trick, or about a recent historical puzzle that was solved. He manages an infectious enthusiasm when he talks about science, and cannot help but assume the role of instructor when he has knowledge to impart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point he became almost giddy and said, “Oh, wait. I have got to show you this.” Then he ran into his office to show us the new 32 gigabyte USB flash drive he recently acquired, so we could marvel at its tiny size and huge capacity. (Ironically, that very morning I had done the same thing with my brothers - I have a new 32 GB USB drive I brought with me to have all my files handy.) He also showed off his digital camera and his new sub-notebook computer. That is pretty impressive for someone of his generation. I can barely get my parents to use a computer (although my mother did learn more quickly when she found out she could shop online).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JREF also has a new small studio in which Randi is making &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JamesRandiFoundation"&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;. Richard Montalvo, who produces the videos for the JREF, sat me down with Randi and we did an impromptu video together, talking about neurology and magic. Without any prep, of course, Randi did not miss a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Randi has found the fountain of youth I think it is in keeping a tireless enthusiasm for new knowledge and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for a wonderful day, Randi.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2008 Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh published a landmark book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trick-Treatment-Undeniable-Alternative-Medicine/dp/0393066614"&gt;Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts About Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=34"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=195"&gt;I reviewed it on this blog last summer&lt;/a&gt;.  It is particularly important since Ernst is a former advocate for CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) who was able to objectively look at the scientific evidence and realize that it doesn’t support most CAM methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the year was out, Ernst had published another book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Healing-Hype-Harm-Complementary-Alternative/dp/1845401182/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1234285737&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Healing, Hype or Harm? A Critical Analysis of Complementary or Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It is a compilation of essays on various general and specific topics in CAM. Ernst is the editor; he and 15 other authors have contributed, mostly from the UK but also including Asbjorn Hrobjartsson from the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Denmark (the author of a landmark paper on placebos), Canadian health activist Terry Polevoy, and our own inimitable James (The Amaz!ng) Randi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the preface, Ernst says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our book tries to look behind the various smoke screens that tend to obstruct our vision and often prevent us from understanding the truth. The authors of this volume have very different backgrounds and views but they are all well-informed critics who do not dismiss CAM lightly. If they disapprove of certain aspects, they do so for well-argued reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It covers many of the topics we have discussed on this blog. David Colquhoun tells a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=34"&gt;Crislip-type&lt;/a&gt; fable about the Department of Alternative Physics and Astrology replacing the old Department of Physics and Astronomy; then he shows how CAM has already infiltrated UK universities in exactly the same manner. Hrobjarttson discusses the importance and frailty of impartiality in CAM research. Michael Baum debunks the “holism” myth by eloquently describing two cases of breast cancer in pregnant women, where the scientific practitioner used knowledge at every level from the failure of DNA repair mechanisms in BRCA1 mutations at the molecular level all the way up to the understanding of a woman in her central role as mother, wife and member of a faith community, and considering her personal life story and fears. Leslie B. Rose describes the elaborate stepwise process of testing new drugs, from animal studies to phase I through IV human trials to post-marketing surveillance, and defines CAM as “a treatment which has not gone through this process, and in which we can have very little confidence that it works and is safe.” Other essays cover placebo, vitalism, patient choice, legal issues, politics and regulation, health care funding, homeopathy, chiropractic, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing interesting nuggets of fact and much food for thought, the book is a treasure trove of effective sound bites we can use in arguing these issues. Here is a sampling that I hope will pique your interest and persuade you to buy the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[On the safety of CAM treatments] “Their inoffensiveness is often testament to their impotence.” And “There can be no effects without side effects.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“We need to be tougher in appraising conventional medicine, let alone the fringe stuff.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Over the last few centuries, a process developed for separating fact from fiction, and it is called science…’the crash testing of ideas.’”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“…scientific medicine has many failings, but alternative medicine offers no way forward in resolving them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Whereas traditional healers express humility in the face of nature and deference towards authority, practitioners of scientific medicine are skeptical and insubordinate…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Just as reason cannot be reconciled with irrationality, so orthodox medicine cannot be integrated with alternative medicine.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“It is also ironic that patients who reject orthodox doctors as paternalistic resort to alternative practitioners whose appeal is largely based on personal charisma and the authority of ancient texts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Homeopathy is plain fraud… no real scientist believes it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The more harm a plant does to humans, the better its chance of survival.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Barmy courses get barmy assessors so the process of accreditation provides no protection…”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Integrated medicine promotes CAM no matter what the evidence says.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Is there any empirical evidence that vital forces exist? The answer is no, and how could there ever be? Is there any evidence that vital forces do not exist? The answer is no and how could there ever be? Vitalism generates no testable hypotheses.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Concepts such as the qi of Chinese traditional medicine are myths which enjoy the same status as religious faiths. Believers cling to the myth despite the evidence, reinterpret the myth to suit the evidence, or lie about the evidence to support the myth.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“There is not a single, convincing example of a therapeutic synergistic effect between different components within a single whole plant extract… the examples usually cited all refer to mixtures of different herbs, to preclinical experiments or have not demonstrated that the observed effects are anything more than additive.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The worst medical doctor can cure diseases and save lives; the best alternative healer can only offer false hopes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Patients have a right to benefit from both specific and non-specific effects. Placebos can at best generate non-specific effects, while effective treatments generate both specific and non-specific effects. It follows, I think, that administering treatments which are not demonstrably better than placebos is not in the best interest of the patient.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many treasures in this book. Next week I will go into more detail about one essay that makes some very important points about the concept of “healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

I still had the mindset that maybe we'd be "lucky" and Charlie would "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/once_upon_a_time_i_tried_to_recover_my_son_from_autism"&gt;lose his diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;" and we wouldn't have to bother with "all that special ed stuff."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have learned to eat my words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it's accounts of parents with adult children who still, like my son, need services and support for their whole lives, that I'm especially drawn to. The February 14th &lt;a href="http://www.yorkregion.com/article/88031"&gt;YorkRegion.com&lt;/a&gt; profiles Elaine Vollett, whose now-38-year-old son John was born 13 weeks premature and given a 1% chance of surviving. She created the &lt;a href="http://www.dreamsinc.ca/"&gt;Centre for Dreams&lt;/a&gt; in Markham to "provide education and stimulation for people with developmental disabilities" after they finish school; the Centre became a registered charity in 2003 and offers educational programming, including job-training and life skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Q &amp;amp; A, Markham notes that she would have rathered that her son was born in this generation than in the previous one, as more services and supports are now available. Nonetheless, she notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know from chatting with parents who have had a baby with a developmental disability and have come to me and asked for advice. There are still problems so I think you would still have some work to do. Acceptance and services are far greater now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the question, "What are the difficulties you think still exist in the developmental services world today?," Vollette says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the biggest stigmas is the fact that people will say "Oh yes, they are cute, they are nice, they are friendly." Unless they know the individuals, they do not see how badly they want to have a job and how badly they want to get a paycheque, how eager they are to grow and try those things. They want to be a part of today's society, to love, play, work in their community, just like everybody else. There are limitations. Some could not put in a full eight-hour day like the rest of us. My son could not go out and put in eight hours of work like you would. So yes, people are very genuine, kind, empathetic to them but the one thing I want to accomplish is to remove that stigma of their limited capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm with Vollett----parents often speak of dreams dashed and lost on hearing that their child has been diagnosed with autism. But over the years, from the times when I couldn't imagine what life with an older Charlie, "still" in special ed and "still" autistic, would be like, I've found plenty to keep dreaming about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie is going to have a job someday, and is going to find his place in society---maybe these sounds like dreams, but they can become realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another mother, whose twin sons are both on the spectrum, in a similar vein. Desiree Childress and her family were featured in the February 15th &lt;a href="http://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/article.cfm?ID=17725"&gt;Martinsville Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. Like Jim and Charlie, they've moved a couple of times to find the best education and services for their children.  Childress, a nurse, is currently homeschooling her sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childress said she is “100 percent sure, even with the grave prognosis we were given,” that David and Isaiah will one day live independently. “I really feel their potential is the same as any other child,” she added.&lt;br&gt;
“Autism is just a part of their life,” she said of her sons. “I want them to be able to say ‘I have autism’ and not feel like they have to hide it. It’s not going to destroy me. That’s what needs to be promoted.&lt;br&gt;
“We have yet to hit puberty,” which will bring new challenges, Childress said. “But we’ve made it this far, so I’m kind of like, ‘Bring it on.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;I've been writing&lt;/a&gt;, puberty does bring new challenges and it has at times been, well, challenging (only three more months till Charlie is 12---gulp). But I'm with Childress saying "Bring it on" and thankful to Vollett for reminding us, to keep on dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;

They’ve attacked women who went to popular bars or wore ‘decadent’ clothing and have recently threatened anyone celebrating Valentine’s Day in India. So those in India without sticks up their asses organized and formed a group called the “Consortium of Pub-going, Loose, and Forward Women.”&lt;/p&gt;

What slogan could be so offensive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bad News Is God Doesn’t Exist, The Good News Is You Don’t Need Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly not the best atheist ad slogan I’ve heard but not bad. But when it was rejected The Italian Union of Atheists, Agnostics and Rationalists  (UAAR) had to go for something a little softer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Good News Is There Are Millions  of Atheists In Italy; The Excellent News Is They Believe In  Freedom Of Expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My thoughts? Eh. I guess it’s okay. It’s better than “Praise Darwin.” Anything’s better than “Praise Darwin.” But it doesn’t do much for me. Plus it’s really long. Why not something shorter and punchier like the U.S. billboards “Beware of Dogma” or “Imagine No Religion” or my favorite, the vaguely religious-sounding “Don’t believe in God? You’re not alone.” Oh, well. At least it’s out there.&lt;/p&gt;

She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging, and even if I did my wife needs me more. Because I foresaw this coming, however, I do have a series of "Best of" reposts lined up. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks. Right now I just don't know. This particular piece has appeared in different forms since 2007.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;"Early detection of cancer saves lives."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard this statement or something resembling it? It's a common assumption (indeed, a seemingly common sense assumption) that detecting cancer early is always a good thing. Why &lt;em&gt;wouldn't&lt;/em&gt; it always be a good thing, after all?  For many cancers, such as breast cancer and colon cancer, there's little doubt tha early detection at the very least makes the job of treating the cancer easier. Also, the cancer is detected at an earlier stage almost by definition. But does earlier detection save lives? This question, as you might expect, depends upon the tumor, its biology, and the quality and cost of the screening modality used to detect the cancer. Indeed, it turns out that the question of whether early detection saves lives is a much more complicated question to answer than you probably think, a question that even many doctors have trouble with. It's also a question that can be argued too far in the other direction. In other words, in the same way that boosters of early detection of various cancers may sometimes oversell the benefits of early detection, there is a contingent that takes a somewhat nihilistic view of the value of screening and argues that it doesn't save lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A corrollary of the latter point is that some boosters of so-called "alternative" medicine take the complexity of evaluating the effect of early screening on cancer mortality and the known trend towards diagnosing earlier and earlier stage tumors as saying that our treatments for cancer are mostly worthless and that the only reason we are apparently doing better against cancer is because of early diagnosis of lesions that would never progress. Here is a typical such comment from a frequent commenter whose hyperbolic style will likely be immediately recognizable to regular readers here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Most cancer goes away, or never progresses, even with NO medical treatment. Most people who get cancer never know it. At least in the past, before early diagnosis they never knew it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now many people are diagnosed and treated, and they never get sick or die from cancer. But this would have also been the case if they were never diagnosed or treated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe early diagnosis and treatment do save the lives of a small percentage of all who are treated. Maybe not. We don't know.&lt;br&gt;
As is so often the case with such simplistic black and white statements, there is a grain of truth buried under the absolutist statement but it's buried so deep that it's well-nigh unrecognizable. Because we see this sort of statement frequently, I thought it would be worthwhile to discuss some of the issues that make the reduction of mortality from cancer so difficult to achieve through screening. I will do this in two parts, although the next part may not necessarily appear next week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_early_detection_of_cancer_more_compl.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_early_detection_of_cancer_more_compl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/m7DcFi2IxA4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234847400373"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2211">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/359428133e9971b5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Barack Obama"/><category term="science"/><title type="html">Obama promotes science</title><published>2009-02-17T05:06:48Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T05:06:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/obama-promotes-science/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama has reached out to the scientific community. He’s already taken big steps towards doing this in both his scientific cabinet appointments and the large amount of scientific spending in his stimulus package. And now he gives this speech: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/obama-promotes-science/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/kFsB1Jk1OQ0/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also shows here his continued support of research to reduce global warming as well as giving a strong endorsement of science as the answer to the biggest problems we face. That’s not a small thing. Children watching this may be inspired to become scientists because of these words. Also, he specifically warns people about pseudoscience that may prey on their prejudices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure this speech is primarily to pay lip service, and no speech guarantees a politician will really follow through with their promises, but the very fact that it was deemed necessary to even pay the same kind of lip service to science that politicians are expected to pay to religion illustrates that the administration feels the scientific community is a base worth catering to. The bottom line is that this message is promoting the thing that Obama has been promoting all along and that this country is in desperate need of: HOPE. Not false hope but hope in things that are actually achievable. And I for one find Obama’s words here inspiring and incredibly refreshing after 8 years of anti-intellectualism.&lt;/p&gt;

I just found another example where I least expected, and I wanted to share it with readers of Swift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Latin American literature is famous for "magical realism" and its fiction is replete with ghosts and spooky doings. Yet I found a thoroughly skeptical view of a medium in Mario Vargas Llosa's novel "Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protagonist is taken to a séance by a friend. The medium is a widower who discovered the spirit world during a phase of abject loneliness after his wife died, and he comments that séances not only allow one to continue seeing and hearing departed loved ones, but they are entertaining and are a great way of killing time. His description makes it sound like a séance is comparable to watching a movie or a sports event, only more boring. In his unimaginative version of the other life, the spirits get sick, fall in love, get married, reproduce, travel... the only difference is that they don't die. He calls up several spirits from Purgatory and engages in stunningly inane conversations, "How are you? It's so nice to hear you. Pray for me.

Listen how this $cientology explains that Osama bin Laden was just nice guy. . .until the mad psychiatrist al-Zawahiri brainwashed him for evil. It all makes perfect sense. There’s only one slight problem with this argument. It’s totally made up and al Zawahiri was never a psychiatrist. So for all those people who admit knowing very little about $cientology but put on their best Chris Crocker impression to passionately tell me to stop attacking $cientology and to leave John Travolta and Tom Cruise alone, just remember this is what they actually believe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“According to the report from MSU’s Product Center for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Michigan’s second-largest industry experienced a 12 percent growth in 2007, the year the study was conducted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin:0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Agriculture is a force for economic stability in Michigan, with yearly economic impact estimated to be $71.3 billion, on the basis of data from 2007,” said Christopher Peterson, director of the MSU Product Center and a study author. “This represents a $7.6 billion increase from the $63.7 billion impact projected in an analysis of 2006 data released last year….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0"&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study shows the agricultural economy expanding at a rate more than five times faster than the growth rate of the general economy (11.9 percent versus 2 percent) between 2006 and 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s just a small problem with this argument. &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article5733638.ece"&gt;Researchers have found that apes and monkeys have a sense of morality&lt;/a&gt; too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a series of studies scientists have found that monkeys and apes can make judgments about fairness, offer altruistic help and empathise when a fellow animal is ill or in difficulties. They even appear to have consciences and the ability to remember obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research implies that morality is not a uniquely human quality and suggests it arose through evolution. That could mean the strength of our consciences is partly determined by our genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The types of experiments researchers performed were designed to test the primate subjects’ sense of fairness and willingness to help others without promise of reward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animals were asked to perform a set of simple tasks and then rewarded with food or affection. The rewards were varied, seemingly at random. De Waal found the animals had an acute sense of fairness and objected strongly when others were rewarded more than themselves for the same task, often sulking and refusing to take part any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study looked at altruism in chimps - and found they were often willing to help others even when there was no obvious reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research suggests that giving is self-rewarding for monkeys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related research found primates can remember individuals who have done them a favour and will make an effort to repay them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where might this sense of morality come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe we could owe our consciences to climate change and, in particular, to a period of intense global warming between 50,000 and 800,000 years ago. The proto-humans living in the forests had to adapt to living on hostile open plains, where they would have been easy prey for formidable predators such as big cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would have forced them to devise rules for hunting in groups and sharing food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Boehm, director of the Jane Goodall Research Center, part of the University of Southern California’s anthropology department, believes such humans devised codes to stop bigger, stronger males hogging all the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To ensure fair meat distribution, hunting bands had to gang up physically against alpha males,” he said. This theory has been borne out by studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In research released at the AAAS he argued that under such a system those who broke the rules would have been killed, their “amoral” genes lost to posterity. By contrast, those who abided by the rules would have had many more children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This reminded me of something that I noticed recently in reading Mark Halpern's book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ThvlwRK4l1oC"&gt;Language and Human Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, namely Halpern's surprising level of interest in the word &lt;em&gt;progressive&lt;/em&gt; and its derivatives, discussed on 15 different pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Halpern was known to me previously as the author of a pro-prescriptivism essay "&lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97mar/halpern/halpern.htm"&gt;The War that Never Ends&lt;/a&gt;", published in The Atlantic in 1997. He isn't  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Halperin"&gt;Mark Halperin&lt;/a&gt; the political analyst; and neither of them is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Helprin"&gt;Mark Helprin&lt;/a&gt; the novelist. Obviously, none of these diverse Mark H's is me, either, though we share first names and a few phonetic features of our surnames, which apparently makes us similar enough that a couple of years ago, someone that I admire revealed her belief that I was both the author of &lt;em&gt;Winter's Tale&lt;/em&gt; and a columnist for  &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;.  I was simultaneously flattered and depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his web site, the &lt;a href="http://www.rules-of-the-game.com/"&gt;Mark Halpern&lt;/a&gt; we're talking about further distinguishes himself from a professor of physics and a San Francisco restaurant consultant. As for his positive features, in a recent comment on LL, Kevin S. closed with an invitation to "Read the writings of Mark Halpern, if you dare. He guts descriptive linguists the way a fisherman guts a perch!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's certainly true that Halpern has a particular animus towards linguists. In &lt;em&gt;Language and Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;, Noam Chomsky is mentioned on 30 pages; Geoff Nunberg is also mentioned on 30 pages; Steve Pinker on 24; Geoff Pullum on 12; John McWhorter on 10 — and the discussions are not generally positive. In fact, the book perhaps should have been titled &lt;em&gt;Linguists and Human Nature&lt;/em&gt;, since these page counts for Halpern's prominent linguistic enemies far exceed the number of references to words involved in analyzing language. Thus the term &lt;em&gt;verb&lt;/em&gt; occurs eight times; &lt;em&gt;adjective&lt;/em&gt; occurs three times; &lt;em&gt;clause&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;subjunctive&lt;/em&gt; occur once each; &lt;em&gt;adverb&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;participle, morpheme, phoneme &lt;/em&gt; not at all. Even the &lt;em&gt;imply/infer&lt;/em&gt; issue only rates mention on 11 pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But forms of the word &lt;em&gt;progressive&lt;/em&gt; occur on 15 pages — &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot;  11 times, &amp;quot;progressives&amp;quot; 3, and &amp;quot;progressivism&amp;quot; once — and needless to say, none of these are referring to the grammatical concept of &amp;quot;progressive aspect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually Halpern uses forms of &lt;em&gt;progressive&lt;/em&gt; to take a swipe at (a broad range of) political views that he dislikes, e.g. on p. 209:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;…[Postmodern] spokesmen try to convince us not merely that no one has such absolute knowledge, or can have such knowledge, but even that there is no such knowledge to be had. They apparently believe that if we give up our absolute beliefs and our belief in the absolute, what will remain is sweet reason. Rorty usually […] seems to think that if we give up our belief in objective reality, we will become liberals or &lt;strong&gt;progressives&lt;/strong&gt; or whatever Utopian socialists are called these days. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or on p. 19 (emphasis added again, and in subsequent quotes):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discrimination&lt;/em&gt;, once the name of an admired intellectual faculty and practice, has been used so often as short for &lt;em&gt;racial discrimination&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bigotry&lt;/em&gt; that its use in its own right is imperiled; here is a typical modern and &lt;strong&gt;'progressive' &lt;/strong&gt;use: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It is wrong for the police to pull a car over just because its black occupants are driving in a rich white neighborhood. It is discrimination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;(The corruption of &lt;em&gt;discrimination&lt;/em&gt; is especially dangerous, because it fosters the notion that the very act of distinguishing between one person or practice and another, no matter on what basis for for what purpose, is reprehensible.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or on p. 198-199:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Language, originally meant to refer to a preexisting world, now more and more is used to build imaginary worlds… The poet tells us that the poem &amp;quot;should not mean, but be&amp;quot;; he has prevailed beyond his fondest wish — more and more of our written words are now used &amp;quot;creatively,&amp;quot; an the symbol of our age is framing quotation marks, used to proclaim &amp;quot;art at work here.&amp;quot; So Communism (with all its isotopes and Lite versions — socialism, &lt;strong&gt;progressivism&lt;/strong&gt;, left-liberalism, radicalism, Utopianism, "activism," and so on), as despotism packaged for the word-intoxicated, gets a free ride on the literacy wagon: it prevails with those who write and read books, while poor old down-market Fascism and Nazism have to court the unlettered, trying to sell despotism by rousing the rabble with long hypnotic speeches, heavily rhythmic music, mass-formation marching, and street fighting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Halpern's dislike of the term &lt;em&gt;progressive &lt;/em&gt;is deeper than his dislike for  the ideas of political progressives (with or without scare quotes). On pp. 245-6, he explains that under his preferred linguistic régime,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[t]o begin with, we should see an end to the use of the &amp;quot;living, growing language&amp;quot; fallacy as an excuse for misuse of the language — meaning not just the solecisms that can create trouble by causing ambiguity and obscurity but that truly abusive practice, the building of prejudices into the language so as to shut down criticism before it can even raise its voice. A good example of this stratagem, as I noted at the outset of this book, is the term &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;progressive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is now generally accepted, even by conservatives, as the proper name of a loosely-defined  cluster of controversial views, and tacitly awards those views the twin crowns of virtue and inevitability.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus it'll do Halpern's blood pressure no good at all to read Nate Silver's explanation of what he means by &lt;em&gt;rational progressivism&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The first type of progressivism has its philosophical underpinnings in 18th Century, Enlightement-era thought. It believes that politics is a battle of ideas. It further believes that through the use of reason and the exchange of ideas, human society will tend to improve itself through scientific and technological innovation. Hence, it believes in progress, and for this reason lays claim to the term “progressive”. Because of its belief and optimism in the faculties of human reason, I refer to this philosophy as &lt;strong&gt;rational progressivism&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;[emphasis original]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about  &amp;quot;virtue and inevitability&amp;quot;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, can we really expect people to name their political philosophies things like "irrational regressionism", "excessive regulationism", "rampant cronyism", "naive over-simplificationism", or whatever?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that there's the &lt;a href="http://belarius.newsvine.com/_news/2007/08/23/915439-two-axis-stupidevil-political-chart-represents-major-advance-in-two-axis-political-chart-technology"&gt;Two-axis Stupid/Evil chart&lt;/a&gt;, where any movement away from [0, 0] represents a decrease in intelligence and/or morality, with political stupidity available in both  positive and negative versions (not enough government vs. too much government), and political evil likewise (moral rigidity vs. moral relativism. But the opposition of Bureaucialism-vs.-Aynarchism and  Diablorthodoxy-vs.-Beelzapologism is a cynical (and morphologically questionable) joke, not a basis for self-identification.  I think we can count on the partisans of political philosophies, from progressivism to objectivism, to choose brand-names that present their ideas in a favorable light.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234839456804"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/just_replace_these_with_jane_h.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/653d02e3083e7331</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Just replace these with Jane Hamsher, Josh Marshall, ....</title><published>2009-02-17T00:04:15Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T00:04:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ESwdOddwpHU/just_replace_these_with_jane_h.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/just_replace_these_with_jane_h.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Obama presser.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Obama%20presser.jpg" width="442" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We were all ramped up for some mega crazy, after Skepchick reader QuestionAuthority sent &lt;a href="http://www.tccsa.tc/fair/fair_ideas.html"&gt;this list of suggested topics&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.tccsa.tc/"&gt;TCCSA&lt;/a&gt;.  A quick perusal of the list makes it pretty clear that the organizers of this event strongly encourage kids to take on topics in direct opposition to established science.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img_1724-271x300.jpg" alt="img_1724" width="271" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking into Har Mar Mall, I practiced my serious face, as I didn’t want to laugh openly at some well meaning kids’ hard work.  After all, it’s not their fault if they are being denied a proper science education.  As we worked our way around to each of the thirty or so displays, anticipating something truly awesome in its ignorance of the way science actually works, we were continually disappointed.  The projects almost invariably showed a decent understanding of the scientific method, and none of the kids picked any of the hot button creationist topics present on the list of suggestions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of topics selected was broad, and covered all major branches of science.  Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/img_17102-1024x768.jpg" alt="img_17102" width="512" height="384"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of a required bible verse on each display, the citation of god’s design as the ultimate reason for findings in a few projects, and religious tracts on several of the tables served as reminders that this was indeed a creation science fair, but in many cases these seemed almost perfunctory.  My impression of at least half of the displays was that the child had first picked a topic they found interesting, and then dug up a bible verse that correlated.  In several cases the verse had nothing at all to do with the research, and in at least one case, the results actually contradicted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that for the most part I was very impressed with the work these kids did.  I expected to leave the mall feeling sad and disgusted, but I actually came out of it feeling quite a bit of hope for humanity.  Whatever else they are being taught, these kids are learning the scientific method, and regardless of the big fat god wall it comes up against in the worldview being imparted to them, I can’t help thinking it’s not that big a leap for them to apply it to that as well.  Obviously not all of them will do so, maybe none will, but they are being given the tools.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234835027780"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/francis_collins_will_be_so_dis.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5eaabe7dd7e383e3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">Francis Collins will be so disappointed</title><published>2009-02-17T00:52:23Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T00:52:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/MtANH-YCc6I/francis_collins_will_be_so_dis.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/francis_collins_will_be_so_dis.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Collins has argued that one piece of evidence for god is the human moral sense, which he claims could not have evolved. I guess we're going to have to call monkeys our brothers and sisters then, since &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article5733638.ece"&gt;researchers have found that monkeys have a sense of morality&lt;/a&gt;. (Let me guess; he'll just push the magic moment of ensoulment back another 30 million years.) Furthermore, they have explanations for how altruism could have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers believe we could owe our consciences to climate change and, in particular, to a period of intense global warming between 50,000 and 800,000 years ago. The proto-humans living in the forests had to adapt to living on hostile open plains, where they would have been easy prey for formidable predators such as big cats.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This would have forced them to devise rules for hunting in groups and sharing food.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Christopher Boehm, director of the Jane Goodall Research Center, part of the University of Southern California's anthropology department, believes such humans devised codes to stop bigger, stronger males hogging all the food.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"To ensure fair meat distribution, hunting bands had to gang up physically against alpha males," he said. This theory has been borne out by studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In research released at the AAAS he argued that under such a system those who broke the rules would have been killed, their "amoral" genes lost to posterity. By contrast, those who abided by the rules would have had many more children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a little glib and speculative, but it's enough to shut down the claim that morality couldn't have evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have deep reservations about some of the claims in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have confirmed that the strength of a person's conscience depends partly on their genes. Several researchers have shown, for example, that the children of habitual criminals will often become criminals too - even when they have had no contact with their biological parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh. Criminality is too flexible and too easily influenced by the environment — strip me of my income and throw me on the streets, and I&amp;#39;ll become a criminal, too, if it keeps me and my family from going hungry. But then, I suppose anyone could claim those are just the genes of my roots in the lower socioeconomic classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/francis_collins_will_be_so_dis.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/MtANH-YCc6I" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234834358449"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simulations_and_analogies_for_understanding_autism">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e4dea00c06b450fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Simulations and Analogies for Understanding Autism</title><published>2009-02-17T01:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-17T01:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/simulations_and_analogies_for_understanding_autism" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/148/357856839_8e6f98e6e5_m.jpg" alt="the shoes and ankes of seven different people ponted inward in a circle, from top left and around clockwise: open toed woman&amp;#39;s shoe, square mens shoe, pointed closed toe woman&amp;#39;s shoe, fancy lacy open toed women&amp;#39;s shoe, tapered mens&amp;#39; shoe, tan cowboy boot, brown square toed men&amp;#39;s boot" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;John Muir Elementary School in Washington took a creative approach to &lt;a href="http://www.king5.com/sharedcontent/northwest/learning-for-life/stories/NW_021209EDU-children-disabilities-LJ.61232b5.html"&gt;teaching (typical) students about disabilities&lt;/a&gt;.  A series of simulations were set up to enable typical students to experience what it might be like to be hard of hearing, dyslexic, or autistic.  I was particularly fond of the simulation where a student puts on head phones that belt out a story while at the same time an adult asks the student questions--that's a nice way of simulating the sort of auditory processing "stuff" I'm quite familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own life, I've found giving people a way to understand my experience of the world--just as much as them giving me a way to understand their experience of the world, both are necessary!--significantly improves my interpersonal relationships and interactions.  It is hard though for anyone to understand an experience they have never had; in fact, it can be hard to even recognize a difference in experience.  I was nearly 30 before I realized I was processing sound differently from others--before then I thought other people just had better coping skills than I, or were "stronger"--more able to "hold up" under the terrible pressure of noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect"&gt;cocktail party effect&lt;/a&gt;?" I now will ask people.  "Imagine what it would be like if you weren't able to do any of that selective filtering, and all you heard was the jumble of all voices, at equal precedence."  Such things help a lot of people understand I'm not just being selfish or cranky or difficult when I insist on meeting in a quiet location, or at my home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simulations at John Muir Elementary School, like the head-phone-and-question simulation, are better than my analogy because they give people a sensate, rather than simply imagined, experience.  According to the broadcast, Youth Awareness Disability Assemblies that does the simulations can be contacted at &lt;a href="http://www.seattleworks.org/agencies/viewAgency.php?_mode=agencyDetail&amp;amp;_action=agencyDetail&amp;amp;ixentity=9306"&gt;yada4schools@msn.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/articles/education/2009/02/13/college-is-possible-for-students-with-intellectual-disabilities.html?PageNr=1"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does the HEOA allow students with intellectual disabilities to qualify for Pell Grants, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, and the Federal Work Study Program for the first time, it also establishes a new grant program that will fund the development of programs tailored specifically to college students with intellectual disabilities across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's emphasized that inclusion is a vital aspect of education for students with intellectual disabilities, at every level, including postsecondary education.  With nearly $5 million from two federal grants, the &lt;a href="http://www.communityinclusion.org/"&gt;University of Massachusetts Boston's Institute for Community Inclusion&lt;/a&gt; (ICI) hopes to help create the first national center and the first research consortium for the postsecondary education of students with intellectual disabilities. Says ICI researcher Debra Hart, who began researching such postsecondary programs a decade ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In just the last week, we found 54 new programs, and we expect to discover about two to three times that many more programs we have not heard of already"............ Since the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act provides federal funding for intellectually disabled students to attend elementary, middle, and high school with ordinary students, why could there not also be a way to help these students experience college? Hart says she asked herself back then. "Everyone deserves to go to college," she says, "students with intellectual disabilities included."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICI itself provides training, clinical, and employment services and also assistance to organizations to "promote inclusion of people with disabilities in school, work, and community activities." On its &lt;a href="http://www.communityinclusion.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; you can find a publication entitled &lt;a href="http://www.communityinclusion.org/article.php?article_id=250#conc"&gt;StateData: The National Report on Employment Services and Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, which concludes that :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vastly more individuals [with intellectual and developmental disabilities] continue to be supported in facility-based employment, earning sub-minimum wage, than in integrated employment earning a living wage. A disproportionate number of individuals with disabilities work in low-wage settings as compared to the general population. In the Vocational Rehabilitation system, the gap between earnings of adults with disabilities at closure and personal income in the general population is large and widening over time. Overall the findings suggest the need for a renewed and shared focus across several systems....&lt;br&gt;
......&lt;br&gt;
.......there continues to be an urgent need for a re-investment of attention, priority, and resources dedicated towards expanding both economic and employment opportunities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few more reasons why we need to think now about postsecondary education and options for students. Turning 21----after which a student is not covered by &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt;---should not be some cut-off date for students who are ready and willing to keep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

But people keep mailing it to me, so in order to shut you all up, I'll chip in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As everyone knows by now, we're in the midst of a really horrible
financial disaster.  I've argued in the past on this blog that the root cause of the entire disaster is pure, simple stupidity on the part of people in the financial business. People gave out mortgages that any
sane rational person would have considered ridiculous. And then they built huge, elaborate  financial structures on top of those mortgages, pretending that by somehow piling layer upon layer, loan upon loan, that
they were somehow creating something that could be considered  real wealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/upload/2009/02/bankcap6-1024x747.jpg" width="341" height="249" alt="bankcap6-1024x747.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; They gave themselves bonuses that boggled the mind. Even after the whole ridiculous system came tumbling down, they &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to give themselves ridiculous bonuses. Insane bonuses. They've been writing themselves checks for millions of dollars to continue to operate their
businesses - even after taking billions of dollars in loans from the government to prevent them from going out of business. I consider
this to be downright criminal. But even if it's not criminal, it's
incredibly &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt;. The very people who ran those firms right to the edge of bankruptcy, who nearly took down our entire financial system
are being &lt;em&gt;rewarded&lt;/em&gt;. Not only are they being allowed to continue
to rut the businesses that they pretty much destroyed, but they've
been paying themselves an astonishing amount of money to do it. And now they're complaining &lt;em&gt;bitterly&lt;/em&gt; about the fact that the government
wants to limit them to a paltry half-million dollars of salary per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; They argue that they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be allowed to earn more than that. Because after all, the people who run those businesses are &lt;em&gt;special&lt;/em&gt;. They're "the best and the brightest". They're
extra-smart. No one else could possibly run those businesses. We can't rely on anyone who'd accept a puny half-mil - they won't be smart enough. They don't have the special knowledge of the business that these people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There's one minor problem with that argument: it doesn't work. A couple of weeks ago, some idiot at JP Morgan circulated a chart that was supposed to summarize just how bad the financial disaster has been. The chart circulated for a couple of &lt;em&gt;weeks&lt;/em&gt; - bounced from mailbox to mailbox, sent from one financial genius to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Only the chart was blatantly, obviously, &lt;em&gt;trivially&lt;/em&gt; wrong, and anyone who had the slightest damned &lt;em&gt;clue&lt;/em&gt; of the assets those businesses managed - i.e., the kind of thing that the idiot who drew the chart was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to know - should have been able to tell at a &lt;em&gt;glance&lt;/em&gt; how wrong it was. But they didn't. In fact, the damned thing didn't stop circulating until (of all people) Bob Cringely 
flamed it. Go look at the chart - it's up at the top of this post. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/02/financial_morons_and_quadratic.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/02/financial_morons_and_quadratic.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/v-XedsomMTo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234826945434"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/16/fire-from-the-fireball-i-doubt-it/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb509d7ee68db0ca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Fire from the fireball?

Worth Texas &lt;a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/dpp/news/Satellite_Debris_Falls_from_T"&gt;is speculating&lt;/a&gt; that a small grass fire may have been caused by the fireball yesterday. I doubt it, though. Watch the video first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;



&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First kudos to the news for finally saying that the fireball was not due to the satellite collision. Even then, there’s still some confusion: &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29223371/"&gt;MSNBC online&lt;/a&gt; reports it &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; from the satellites, but MSNBC TV has video of reporters speculating it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;; some debris has been found, but since I’m positive the fireball is unrelated to the satellites, the debris is probably just something that blew around from a construction site or something and onto a field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visit msnbc.com for &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com"&gt;Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507"&gt;World News&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072"&gt;News about the Economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pipe in the field doesn’t look quite damaged enough to have fallen through the atmosphere at Mach 20, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll add that some in the mainstream media are crowing a wee bit early and incorrectly about all this, like &lt;a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/People_report_seeing_falling_debris_in_Texas_.html"&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; who says that bloggers and twitterers all got it wrong… hey dude, not &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of us did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the fire in the Fox video is most likely coincidence. Meteorites are generally not hot enough to start fires when they impact. They slow down to subsonic speeds quickly (which is why the outer parts get so hot and they glow), but then take several more minutes falling through frigid air before hitting the ground; plenty of time to cool off. You need a pretty big object to start a fire, and that would leave an impressive crater. Most likely the fire is a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they do find meteoric debris in that fire after they investigate it, it’ll be in the news. But I bet if they don’t it’ll be relegated to some back page of a newspaper someplace. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll add that even though I have slowly but surely had a growing contempt for much of old media, this event has prodded me further along. Somehow, covering this event faster, more accurately, and better than any newspaper or local news station, but still being made fun of for being just &amp;quot;a blogger&amp;quot; doesn’t make me feel confident that a lot of the people still entrenched in the old media have a clue about teh intertoobz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present company excluded, of course. The folks at Discover Magazine get it, and I’m glad they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, the best UFO footage ever. &lt;br&gt;Oh, The Sun. You make &lt;br&gt;my life so much more wonderful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you get when you mix the usual non-existent journalistic standards of The Sun with the usual goofiness of breathless video of Venus/a bright star/an airplane mistaken for a UFO?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, you get the most wonderful — and true — story lede ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Could this be the clearest clip yet of a UFO above our skies?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why is this lede so awesomely wonderful? Well, &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/ufos/article2241993.ece"&gt;just watch the clip&lt;/a&gt;. I find myself agreeing: yes, a fuzzy, shaky, curse-laden video clip that lasts all of 15 seconds really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; among the best UFO video footage ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who would’ve thought The Sun would ever get something right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don’t really have an easily accessible repository of evidence-based interventions.  Every field has its own standards, its own literature, and its up to each individual practitioner to interpret the data on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some data bases, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm"&gt;USPSTF&lt;/a&gt; which gives data for preventative services, and &lt;a href="http://pier.acponline.org/index.html"&gt;PIER&lt;/a&gt;, a service of the American College of Physicians, which gives information on specific diseases and includes interpretations of evidence.  There’s also &lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/"&gt;the Cochrane Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;, which helps evaluate evidence.   But there is no single “go-to” site for these things, and while we follow evidence-based guidelines in much of our care, there are many times when evidence isn’t just hard to find but is actually unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give our “evidence gap”, I was heartened to see &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/health/policy/16health.html"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times.   The Times reports that the economic stimulus bill will include over a billion dollars to fund research into medical evidence.  This is a good thing, but it’s bound to be controversial.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/02/health_care_is_infrastructure.php"&gt;But I’ve mentioned before&lt;/a&gt; that we need to spend money to improve our medical infrastructure, and this could be a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what we do in medicine is science-based, and much of it has evidence to support it, but some does not.  There are plenty of open questions about how we practice medicine, and in order to deliver safe, quality care, we need answers. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=374"&gt;One example was explored by Dr. Gorski earlier&lt;/a&gt;.  In another example, &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/359/11/1097"&gt;a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; compared surgical and non-surgical therapy for arthritis of the knee.  Surgery made logical, scientific sense, but it had never  been carefully compared to non-surgical therapy.  The study showed that conservative therapy, which is cheaper and less invasive, was just as effective as surgery.  This doesn’t mean that surgery will never help, but it is strong evidence that we should treat arthritis of the knee more conservatively. Studies like this aren’t free, but if their results are reliable and repeatable, they may save us a lot of money and possible surgical complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea of investing more money into comparing medical treatments makes sense, both scientifically and economically.  Now there’s a lot of predictable objections about this; people are worried about physician autonomy and government interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Congress translated the idea into legislation, it became a lightning rod for pharmaceutical and medical-device lobbyists, who fear the findings will be used by insurers or the government to deny coverage for more expensive treatments and, thus, to ration care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators complained that the legislation would allow the federal government to intrude in a person’s health care by enforcing clinical guidelines and treatment protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that the legislation says anything about &lt;em&gt;enforcing&lt;/em&gt; clinical guidelines, but to be fair, there is some implication along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so what?  Right now, my patients’ insurance programs do exactly the same thing—if I prescribe an angiotensin receptor blocker for blood pressure control, I’m going to be asked to justify why I am giving this rather than the cheaper and as-effective ACE-inhibitor.  The answer is usually that the ACE-I caused side-effects, but the question isn’t stupid.  Why should an insurer pay more when an equally effective, cheaper alternative is available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have more evidence to work with, we can continue to make even better decisions regarding care.  It may seem intrusive, but it’s not very different from what we do already.  And honestly, I’d like to know if I’m more likely to get relief of my lumbar radiculopathy from surgery or from conservative therapy.  I will not be offended in the least if my surgeon got a call from my insurer asking if surgery was really my best option, as long as the answer was supported by good evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rings rather hollow when people protest against gaining &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; knowledge.  Libertarian types complain that this will inevitably lead to government interference (and it might, and maybe it should) but to ignore the need for evidence is absurd.  We, as physicians and patients, need &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; knowledge, not less, and we shouldn’t be afraid of where the data lead.  Once we have the data, we can sit down for a good, heated discussion about what to do with it.  But putting our collective heads in the sand is probably not a useful response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday 7 February 2009, Australia experienced its worst natural disaster in more than 100 years, when catastrophic bushfires killed more than 200 people and destroyed more than 1800 homes in Victoria, Australia.  These fires occurred on a day of unprecedented high temperatures in south-east Australia, part of a heat wave that started 10 days earlier, and a record dry spell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been written from Melbourne, Australia, exactly one week after the fires, just enough time to pause and reflect on this tragedy and the extraordinary weather that led to it.  First, I want to express my sincere sympathy to all who have lost family members or friends and all who have suffered through this disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been very high global media coverage of this natural disaster and, of course, speculation on the possible role of climate change in these fires.  So, did climate change cause these fires? The simple answer is “No!”  Climate change did not start the fires. Unfortunately, it appears that one or more of the fires may have been lit by arsonists, others may have started by accident and some may have been started by fallen power lines, lightning or other natural causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there is a different way to phrase that question: In what way, if any, is climate change likely to have affected these bush fires?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, we need to look at the history of fires and fire weather over the last hundred years or so. Bushfires are a regular occurrence in south-east Australia, with previous disastrous fires on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday_fires"&gt;Ash Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, 16 February 1983, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(1939)"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, 13 January 1939, both of which led to significant loss of life and property.  Fortunately, a recent report &lt;a href="http://www.climateinstitute.org.au/images/stories/bushfire/fullreport.pdf"&gt;“Bushfire Weather in Southeast Australia: Recent Trends and Projected Climate Change Impacts”&lt;/a&gt;(ref. 1) in 2007 provides a comprehensive assessment on this topic.  In addition, a &lt;a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs17c.pdf"&gt;Special Climate Statement&lt;/a&gt;(ref 2) from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology describes the extraordinary heat wave and drought conditions at the time of the fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Black Friday fires, the MacArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) was developed in the 1960s as an empirical indicator of weather conditions associated with high and extreme fire danger and the difficulty of fire suppression.  The FFDI is the product of terms related to exponentials of maximum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of fuel (measured using a drought factor). Each of these terms is related to environmental factors affecting the severity of bushfire conditions. The formula for FFDI is given in the report on Bushfire Weather in Southeast Australia.  The FFDI scale is used for the rating of fire danger and the declaration of total fire ban days in Victoria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Fire Danger Rating           FFDI range
High                          12 to 25
Very High                     25 to 50
Extreme                         &amp;gt;50
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FFDI scale was developed so that the disastrous Black Friday fires in 1939 had an FFDI of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the environmental conditions associated with the catastrophic bushfires on 7 February 2009, we need to consider each of the factors and the possible role of climate change in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum temperature:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the easiest factor to consider.  Melbourne and much of Victoria had record high maximum temperatures on 7 February (2).  Melbourne set a new record maximum of 46.4°C, 0.8°C hotter than the previous all-time record on Black Friday 1939 and 3°C higher than the previous February record set on 8 February 1983 (the day of a dramatic dust storm in Melbourne), based on more than 100 years of observations.  But maybe the urban heat island in Melbourne has influenced these new records.  That may be true for Melbourne, but many other stations in Victoria set new all-time record maximum temperatures on 7 February, including the high-quality rural site of Laverton, near Melbourne, with a new record maximum temperature of 47.5°C, 2.5°C higher than its previous record in 1983.  The extreme heat wave on 7 February came after another record-setting heat wave 10 days earlier, with Melbourne experiencing three days in a row with maximum temperatures higher than 43°C during 28-30 January, unprecedented in 154 years of Melbourne observations. A remarkable image of the surface temperature anomalies associated with this heat wave is available from the &lt;a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=36900"&gt;NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increases of mean temperature and mean maximum temperature in Australia have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change, as reported in the IPCC Fourth Assessment, with a best estimate of the anthropogenic contribution to mean maximum temperature increases of about 0.6°C from 1950 to 1999 (&lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;amp;doi=10.1175%2FJCLI-3265.1"&gt;Karoly and Braganza, 2005&lt;/a&gt;).  A recent analysis of observed and modelled extremes in Australia finds a trend to warming of temperature extremes and a significant increase in the duration of heat waves from 1957 to 1999 (&lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/120835621/PDFSTART"&gt;Alexander and Arblaster, 2009&lt;/a&gt;).  Hence, anthropogenic climate change is likely an important contributing factor in the unprecedented maximum temperatures on 7 February 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative humidity:&lt;/strong&gt; Record low values of relative humidity were set in Melbourne and other sites in Victoria on 7 February, with values as low as 5% in the late afternoon.  While very long-term high quality records of humidity are not available for Australia, the very low humidity is likely associated with the unprecedented low rainfall since the start of the year in Melbourne and the protracted heat wave.   No specific studies have attributed reduced relative humidity in Australia to anthropogenic climate change, but it is consistent with increased temperatures and reduced rainfall, expected due to climate change in southern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Extreme fire danger events in south-east Australia are associated with very strong northerly winds bringing hot dry air from central Australia.  The weather pattern  and northerly winds on 7 February were similar to those on Ash Wednesday and Black Friday, and the very high winds do not appear to be exceptional nor related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drought factor:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned above, Melbourne and much of Victoria had received record low rainfall for the start of the year.  Melbourne had 35 days with no measurable rain up to 7 February, the second longest period ever with no rain, and the period up to 8 February, with a total of only 2.2 mm was the driest start to the year for Melbourne in more than 150 years (2). This was preceded by 12 years of very much below average rainfall over much of south-east Australia, with record low 12-year rainfall over southern Victoria (2).  This contributed to extremely low fuel moisture (3-5%) on 7 February 2009.  While south-east Australia is expected to have reduced rainfall and more droughts due to anthropogenic climate change, it is difficult to quantify the relative contributions of natural variability and climate change to the low rainfall at the start of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although formal attribution studies quantifying the influence of climate change on the increased likelihood of extreme fire danger in south-east Australia have not yet been undertaken, it is very likely that there has been such an influence. Long-term increases in maximum temperature have been attributed to anthropogenic climate change. In addition, reduced rainfall and low relative humidity are expected in&lt;br&gt;
southern Australia due to anthropogenic climate change. The FFDI for a number of sites in Victoria on 7 February reached unprecedented levels, ranging from 120 to 190, much higher than the fire weather conditions on Black Friday or Ash Wednesday, and well above the “catastrophic” fire danger rating (1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on bushfires in southeast Australia or elsewhere in the world are not new or unexpected. In 2007, the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report WGII chapter “&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter11.pdf"&gt;Australia and New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;” concluded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
An increase in fire danger in Australia is likely to be associated with a reduced interval between fires, increased fire intensity, a decrease in fire extinguishments and faster fire spread. In south-east Australia, the frequency of very high and extreme fire danger days is likely to rise 4-25% by 2020 and 15-70% by 2050.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, observed and expected increases in forest fire activity have been linked to climate change in the western US, in Canada and in Spain (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/sci;313/5789/940.pdf"&gt;Westerling et al, 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/~nathan/pdf/2004GL020876.pdf"&gt;Gillett et al, 2004&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/l05n0260561797g3/"&gt;Pausas, 2004&lt;/a&gt;). While it is difficult to separate the influences of climate variability, climate change, and changes in fire management strategies on the observed increases in fire activity, it is clear that climate change is increasing the likelihood of environmental conditions associated with extreme fire danger in south-east Australia and a number of other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

He brought up the topic of racism,the KKK and such, and asked why skeptics don’t talk about racism at all. I said that I didn’t think there was much of a reason to talk about it because no one takes groups like the KKK seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conversation happened a while back, and a few beers into the evening, so the details of it are fuzzy, but I seem to recall him saying that the KKK is not so easily dismissed as ridiculous down in Savannah. Growing up in a relatively well-off (read: pasty white) suburb of Chicago, racism for me had always been discussed as a hypothetical/phlosophical/intellectual topic. And at the end of the discussion, no one ever uttered the words, “Really, the Nazis had a point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reality is, I know people who didn’t vote for Obama solely for the reason that he’s black. And I now live in a community that just a few years ago was considered rural, now it’s considered a suburb. There has been talk about extending the train line out to our town, we’ve even built a train station (and if you go to the train station now, you can take the bus to another train station that has a real train going to it).  But the people out here have voted against actually extending the train because they’re afraid it will bring crime (read: black people) in from Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, I don’t talk about racism beause &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; think it’s ridiculous, and I’ve naively thought that everyone else does, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you think racism isn’t talked about much in the skeptical community? Should it be? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234816140304"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/16/hope-for-science/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f409a5d8679b0757</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Hope for science</title><published>2009-02-16T20:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T20:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/16/hope-for-science/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Go ahead.

Or, that based on the round dismissal of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2006/02/they-predicted-cooling-in-1970s.php"&gt;myth of 1970s global cooling warnings&lt;/a&gt; we'd stop hearing about that in the media too.  But instead I'm watching TV last night and there's all these unbelievable crank ads sponsored by the anti-regulation ideologues the &lt;a href="http://www.americansforprosperity.org/"&gt;Americans for Prosperity&lt;/a&gt; featuring &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/05/fake_experts.php"&gt;fake expert&lt;/a&gt; John Coleman.  His senseless rant against the stimulus and the evils of regulation is accompanied by text on the bottom of the screen declaring "global warming it is the hoax" and "it is the greatest scam in history".  It is amazing in this day and age that this shameless conspiracy theory is being broadcast on national television. There is no way that one can on the one hand describe anti-AGW denialism as skepticism, and at the same time be a proponent of such an absurd conspiracy that thousands of scientists around the world, and journals, and editors, and politicians are all in cahoots to falsify data about climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if there is a truism about crankery that I can come up with to explain the persistence of debunked arguments, it is that good ideas may come and go, but we're stuck with the bad ones forever.  For instance, we saw this weekend that George will &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; thinks there were predictions of global cooling in the 1970s.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/02/the_importance_of_actually_rea.php"&gt;Scibling James&lt;/a&gt; decries George Will's inability to read what he cites, but this is nothing new.  George's &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=90"&gt;Willful Ignorance&lt;/a&gt; on this topic has persisted for years this isn't the first time he's &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20998-2004Dec22.html"&gt;misquoted that exact same article&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/31/AR2006033101707.html"&gt;second time either&lt;/a&gt; despite being &lt;a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200604070009"&gt;corrected by others&lt;/a&gt;.  His &lt;a href="http://www.denialism.com/labels/George%20Will.html"&gt;incompetence at judging sources&lt;/a&gt;, and his inability to stop citing false information shows he's simply unwilling or unable to differentiate between legitimate and false information, or even read for comprehension for that matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can be our response to this consistent dishonesty from Will?  A repeat of a cherry-pick not once, or twice, but three times despite this being clearly false?  I think the only thing you can say about someone like this, a man who &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/04/unified_theory_of_the_crank.php"&gt;can't be turned&lt;/a&gt;, is that they're a crank.&lt;br&gt;

I thought I had read up on most every issue concerning the philosophy of religion before reading his book, but I was wrong, dead wrong. His passionate analysis is significant and thought provoking in every single chapter I've read so far (thru chapter six). I think Eller should be the new spokesman for atheism and invited to speak at every atheist conference. I think Christians need to deal with the power of his arguments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my book I argue against a specific religious viewpoint likened to a small limb growing out of the very large tree of religion. I'm not arguing against animism, animatism, nor ancestor worship, ethical non-theism (like Buddhism) nor the many polytheistic gods and goddesses, nor do I argue against other monotheisms like the several branches of Judaism or Islam, nor do I argue against whatever original Christianities believed, nor liberalism, nor deism. No. I'm arguing against a small sect in time, evangelical Christianity. And among evangelicals themselves there is no consensus about true Christianity, relegating certain other branches as "cults." Christianity is best understood as a "local Christianity," one situated in a particular time and place held by particular localized people. What a particular Christian believes is a hybrid coming from schism after schism and the conclusions of hindsight through the process of syncretism. Eller effectively argues that Christians believe in a local Christianity or no Christianity at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I argue specifically about the dominant American fundamentalist or evangelical view in my book, Dr. Eller argues against religion itself. Along the way Eller advances (or promotes) our understanding of just what atheism is. [Hint, atheism is not just a view that stands in contrast with the dominant religious view of any particular society. Atheism in Hindu countries would be a-Hinduist, while atheism in Christian countries would be considered a-Christian. But this cannot be what atheism is about!] We atheists have allowed the dominant religious view of our societies to set the definition for what atheism is, and even the language we use to debate the issues, Eller argues. Why is it that most debates in western cultures are debates on such topics as “Christianity vs. Atheism”? Eller wants us to think in larger terms than that. From reading what Eller says the real debate should be set in terms of “Christianity vs. Itself,” since there are so many branches of it, or “Christianity vs. All Other Religions,” since that’s the proper way to think about religion (can you imagine a Christian wanting to debate that topic with an atheist??). Eller writes: “Nothing is more destructive to religion than other religions; it is like meeting one’s own anti-matter twin.” (p. 233).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eller also argues that there is no specific “Science vs. Religion” problem either, since some religions do not believe in any personal god, and because religious believers are not against most scientific disciplines. Believers are only opposed to those scientific disciplines that come into direct conflict with their own specific religious claims. Some religions don’t even have a creation theory! Surely religious believers are not opposed to quantum theory or gravitational theory or meteorology or botany or gemology (the study of gems), for starters. They are only opposed to specific claims within physics and biology when science crosses over into the arbitrary and sacred/profane boundary of specific religious claims. Religious believers are not opposed to science as a whole, just some aspects of it! So the debate is not about science vs. religion but rather about specific local religions vs specific scientific claims. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is much more to his book. Every person interested in these issues (both believer and non-believer) should get and read and discuss it. I consider his book essential for understanding these issues. Eller writes well, is passionate, intelligent, and offers very powerful arguments against religion as a whole. In the process he more than adequately advances atheism. This book is destined to be a classic work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------&lt;br&gt;One last note. I wish people who interviewed such eminent scholars would know the right questions to ask, stop interrupting them, and stop using the interview to advance their own pet peeves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It's interesting to see how people's spending patterns respond to a (presumably) temporary decline in income during the recession.  
Which items are more or less income-elastic in the short run? A pediatrician friend of ours mentions that he is seeing less business; when there are three kids with coughs, for example, a parent [...]

So no, Greg, I don&amp;#39;t have much to say about our &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/02/creationism_and_evolution_in_t.php"&gt;panel discussion on evolution/creation education&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday — you&amp;#39;ll have to do it for me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/barts-logo.jpg" width="361" height="95"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not so long ago that I discovered that the very sensible medical students at Barts were protesting vigourously about being forced to mix with various  quacks.  A bit of investigation soon showed that the students were dead  right: see &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=555"&gt;St Bartholomew’s teaches antiscience, but students revolt&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it seems that these excellent students have not yet succeeded in educating  their own  &lt;a href="http://www.ihse.qmul.ac.uk/staff/staff.php?m.carroll@qmul.ac.uk"&gt;Dr  Mark Carroll&lt;/a&gt; who, ironically, has the title Associate Dean (Education Quality) in the Centre for Medical Education (SMD), specialising in all aspects of quality assurance in the SMD,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently this letter was sent to all medical students.  They are so indignant at the way they are being treated, it didn’t take long for a copy of the letter to reach me via a plain brown email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt; Does any medical student have a particular interest in Complementary Medicine?  If so, a group at Westminster University would like to contact you (see email message below) with a view to some collaborative work.  Further details from Dr Mark Carroll ( &lt;a href="https://webmail.stu.qmul.ac.uksrc/compose.php?send_to=m.carroll%40qmul.ac.uk"&gt;m.carroll@qmul.ac.uk &lt;/a&gt;). 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am writing this email to put you in contact with **** ******, who is a Naturopathy student at Westminster University and who has set up a Society for Integrated Health, which is closely affiliated with the Society of Complementary Medicine at University College London Hospital.  **** is keen to create a network of connections between student complementary practitioners and medical students and, given Barts’ teaching commitment to integrated approaches, I wondered if you could have put **** in contact with any individual student or group of students that might be interested in joining her developing network of practitioners “crossing the divide”.  Given that Barts is “ahead of the game” I have suggested to **** that she should affiliate Barts among a number of other hospitals to her fast developing group. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A student of naturopathy?  Does Mark Carroll have the slightest idea  what naturopathy is (or pretends to be)?   If so, why is he promoting  it? If not, he clearly hasn’t done his homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a taste  of naturopathy in &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=259"&gt;Another  worthless validation: the University of Wales and nutritional therapy&lt;/a&gt;,  or in &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=259"&gt;Nutritional Fairy Tales from Thames Valley University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a branch of quackery that is so barmy that it’s actually banned in some US states.  &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=161"&gt;A  pharmacist was fined $1 miilion for practising it&lt;/a&gt;.  But Barts encourages it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or read here about the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=384"&gt;College of Natural Nutrition: bizarre teaching revealed&lt;/a&gt;.  They claim to cure thyroid cancer with castor oil compresses, and a holder of their diploma was fined £800 000 for causing brain damage to a patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed the name of the hapless  naturopathy student, I have no wish for her to get abusive mail.  It  isn’t her fault that she has been misled by people who should know better.   If you feel angry about this sort of thing then that should be directed  to the people who mislead them.  The poor student has been misled in  to taking courses that teach &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts  emit high yin energy&lt;/a&gt; by the University of Westminster’s Vice-chancellor, Professor Geoffrey Petts,  But  note that  &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=984#wmin"&gt;Professor  Petts has recently set up a review &lt;/a&gt;of the teaching  of what he must know to be nonsense (though it hasn’t got far yet).  In contrast, Dr Carroll appears to be quite unrepentant. He is the person you to whom you should write if you feel indignant.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims Barts is &amp;quot;ahead of the game&amp;quot;.  Which game? Apparently the game of leading medicine back to the dark ages and the High Street quack shop. But, Dr Carroll, it isn’t a game. Sick people are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Carroll is the Associate Dean (Education Quality) in the Centre for Medical Education (SMD), specialising in all aspects of quality assurance in the SMD.  This has to be the ultimate irony.  It’s true that the Prince of Wales approach to medicine has penetrated slightly into other, otherwise good, medical schools (&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming"&gt;for example, Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;) but I’m not aware of any other that has gone so far down the road of irrationality as at Barts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Carroll, I suggest you listen to your students a bit more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also listen to President Obama.  He has just allocated $1.1  billion “&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/health/policy/16health.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=health" title="New York Times"&gt;to compare drugs, medical devices, surgery and other ways of treating specific  conditions&lt;/a&gt;“.  This has infuriated the drug industry and far-right talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Doubtless it will infuriate quacks too, if any of it is spent on testing their treatments properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Obama Administration News: &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Vice-President-Joe-Biden-Announces-Kareem-Dale-As-Special-Assistant-to-the-President-for-Disability-Policy/"&gt;Kareem Dale&lt;/a&gt;, who is partially blind, was appointed as Special Assistant to the President for Disability Policy.  Vice President Biden discussed the appointment and emphasized that the disability rights movement is a civil rights movement at &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/02/13/Biden-honors-a-movement-at-the-Special-Olympics/%20and%20special%20olympics"&gt;the Special Olympics in Boise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Dogs, Dogs, Dogs: Service dogs for some reason kept popping up in my feeds last week, needing money for a dog in the &lt;a href="http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20090214/NEWS/902130225/1007?Title=Raising_money_to_buy_a_four_footed_helper"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, needing money for a dog in the &lt;a href="http://michelleoneilwrites.blogspot.com/2008/11/service-dog-for-riley.html"&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;, facing &lt;a href="http://www.aspieweb.net/eviction-due-to-companion-dog-aspergers-autism/"&gt;discrimination because of a dog&lt;/a&gt;, enjoying the &lt;a href="http://whittereronautism.com/2009/02/dog%E2%80%99s-for-autistic-children-%E2%80%93-a-preliminary-report/"&gt;benefits of a dog&lt;/a&gt;, and more personally I learned that some folks close to me just made a donation to help a boy get dog.  While I don't myself have a dog, I do like dogs and hope that people can get access to four footed friends who help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Art, Advocacy, and Autistic Culture: Artist/Autist self-and-parent-advocate Rozagy &lt;a href="http://www.emaxhealth.com/1/119/29132/artist-autism-calls-join-autistic-culture-movement.html"&gt;is raising a million pounds&lt;/a&gt; for UK autism charities with her creativity and emphasis on the Autistic culture movement.  Gloom and doom isn't the only way to fundraise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Monster Update: &lt;a href="http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/02/autistic-monster-ad-yanked.html"&gt;ABFH reports&lt;/a&gt; the ads have ceased, YES! Marketing magazine ran an &lt;a href="http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/879752/Disability-activists-call-Action-Children-withdraw-autism-ad/"&gt;article on the debacle&lt;/a&gt;, in particular highlighting those of you who helped out with the protest via Facebook.  The &lt;a href="http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/"&gt;Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/a&gt;--which many of you wrote to in the last few weeks, perhaps via this site--have decided the official complaints do warrant formal investigation.  It may be a few months before we hear back what comes of that.  So to all of you who blogged, Facebooked, actioned, told even one other person about it, and otherwise worked this (especially &lt;a href="http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/"&gt;The New Republic&lt;/a&gt; for continued dedication and helping me to keep up with events), good work!  Good work all of you!

&lt;p&gt;I’ve collected various &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/seancarroll"&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; featuring my bad self, but I honestly can’t bear to watch any of them.  Can’t stand to see myself speaking (although obviously I have no issues with &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people listening raptly).

1145 PM EST FRI FEB 13 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…POSSIBLE SATELLITE DEBRIS FALLING ACROSS THE REGION…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN JACKSON HAS RECEIVED CALLS THIS EVENING FROM THE PUBLIC CONCERNING POSSIBLE EXPLOSIONS AND…OR EARTHQUAKES ACROSS THE AREA. THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION HAS REPORTED TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THESE EVENTS ARE BEING CAUSED BY FALLING SATELLITE DEBRIS. THESE PIECES OF DEBRIS HAVE BEEN CAUSING SONIC BOOMS…RESULTING IN THE VIBRATIONS BEING FELT BY SOME RESIDENTS…AS WELL AS FLASHES OF LIGHT ACROSS THE SKY. THE CLOUD OF DEBRIS IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF THE RECENT IN ORBIT COLLISION OF TWO SATELLITES ON TUESDAY…FEBRUARY 10TH WHEN KOSMOS 2251 CRASHED INTO IRIDIUM 33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/f1wgPyzlL2M%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26fmt%3D18&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching it again makes it even more clear to me that this was an asteroid fragment a meter or so across (probably less) and not part of the debris cloud from the satellites. It’s simply moving too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if we’ll see any more video of it? 20 years ago, shots like this were incredibly rare, but they’re getting more common. Meteors are far easier to see at night — of course, since intrinsically fainter ones are easier to see against a dark background — and so we get them on bank security cameras, parking lot cams, and so on. But during the day it’s a lot tougher, since only the relatively rare very bright fireball gets spotted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this may be the only video we get… but I will make you an absolute rock-solid guarantee: as time goes on, we’ll get more video of such events. More and more people have video cameras, and I hear that the next-gen iPhone will have video. In five years half the planet will be walking around with what are essentially scientific tools. With video, plus geolocation provided by real-time GPS in phones, we’ll be able to determine accurate orbits of bolides like this one. I wonder what we’ll learn from that?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234806157399"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3831">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/31d6f0eeaaa3f207</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Media"/><category term="music"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">Something for Nothing</title><published>2009-02-16T17:13:41Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T17:13:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/2KvIyReF_tE/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/something-for-nothing/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The streaming music site &lt;a href="http://muxtape.com/"&gt;Muxtape&lt;/a&gt; has returned as a free platform for musicians to promote their music.

Founded in early 2008, the site quickly became ensnared in licensing disputes and was shut down last August.

She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging, and even if I did my wife needs me more. Because I foresaw this coming, however, I do have a series of "Best of" reposts lined up. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks. Right now I just don't know. This post appeared in February 2006.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 1907, Adolf Hitler's mother &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klara_Hitler"&gt;Klara&lt;/a&gt; died of breast cancer at age 47, when Hitler was only 18. The young Hitler was devastated by her death. Indeed, in &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/em&gt;, Hitler &lt;a href="http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv1ch01.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;described her death thusly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;These were the happiest days of my life and seemed to me almost a dream; and a mere dream it was to remain. Two years later, the death of my mother put a sudden end to all my highflown plans.

&lt;p&gt;It was the conclusion of a long and painful illness which from the beginning left little hope of recovery. Yet it was a dreadful blow, particularly for me. I had honored my father, but my mother I had loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eduard Bloch,  the family physician who diagnosed and treated Klara Hitler's breast cancer was, through an odd quirk of fate, Jewish. Consequently it is not surprising that some, such as &lt;a href="http://www.teacheroz.com/hitler.htm"&gt;Rudolf Binion&lt;/a&gt;, have speculated that a hatred of Dr. Bloch for "failing" to save his mother might have been one factor behind Hitler's later violent anti-Semitism and even may have resulted in the Holocaust.  Some of the treatments that Bloch used to treat Klara Hitler have been described as some as poor medical care or even quackery. That is why I found a recent article by Sandy Macleod in &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=pubmed&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;amp;list_uids=16403142&amp;amp;query_hl=4&amp;amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australian Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to be of interest. It is argued that, contrary to the criticisms that were later leveled against Bloch, that Dr. Bloch actually performed his treatments competently according to the prevailing medical standards of the time. MacCleod describes Klara's initial presentation thusly:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/mrs_hitler_and_her_doctor_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/mrs_hitler_and_her_doctor_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/iEP6sBkC5wI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234803334877"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2273148257347986519">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7daac1695d317024</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">IDiots and the Genetic Fallacy.</title><published>2009-02-16T16:22:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T16:58:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/idiots-and-genetic-fallacy.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2273148257347986519/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2273148257347986519" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The term Genetic Fallacy is used to describe fallacious arguments that attack an idea based on its origins (genesis) and not its current validity.

As Julia Ioffe of the New Republic blog &lt;a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2009/02/10/from-the-department-of-delirium.aspx"&gt;The Plank&lt;/a&gt; reports, Castro's latest editorial for &lt;em&gt;Granma Internacional &lt;/em&gt;is a "deliciously confusing" excursus on White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and his name. Here are the opening lines in &lt;a href="http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2009/febrero/lun9/rahm.html"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2009/febrero/lun9/reflexiones.html"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;¡Qué apellido tan extraño! Parece español, fácil de pronunciar y no lo es. Nunca en mi vida conocí o leí el nombre de alumno o compatriota entre decenas de miles, que llevara ese nombre.&lt;br&gt;
¿De dónde proviene?, pensé.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a strange surname! It appears Spanish, easy to pronounce, but it’s not. Never in my life have I heard or read about any student or compatriot with that name, among tens of thousands.&lt;br&gt;
Where does it come from? I wondered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castro ponders whether there is a connection to Immanuel Kant, and then moves on to consider a book by Germán Sánchez, Cuba's ambassador to Venezuela, entitled &lt;em&gt;La transparencia de Enmanuel&lt;/em&gt;. He eventually gets back to Rahm, stating that "the growing problems of U.S. capitalist society" cannot be solved by "Obama, Emanuel, and all of the brilliant politicians and economists who have come together," even if they had assistance from the ghosts of Kant, Plato, Aristotle, and "John Kenneth Galbraight" [sic].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Castro had checked out Rahm Emanuel's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel"&gt;Wikipedia entry&lt;/a&gt;, he might not have been so mystified by the name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surname Emanuel (&lt;span lang="he"&gt;עמנואל&lt;/span&gt;), adopted by the family in honor of his father's brother Emanuel Auerbach, killed in Jerusalem during a skirmish with Arabs, means &lt;em&gt;God is with us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia links to a 1997 &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E4D61631F936A25755C0A961958260&amp;amp;sec=&amp;amp;spon=&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;New York Times profile&lt;/a&gt; of Emanuel and his brothers mentioning the story of Emanuel Auerbach's death in 1933 and the subsequent renaming of the family by Rahm's father Benjamin. (A &lt;a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/64159319.html?dids=64159319:64159319&amp;amp;FMT=ABS&amp;amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;amp;date=Jul+1%2C+1997&amp;amp;author=Hillel+Kuttler&amp;amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;amp;edition=&amp;amp;startpage=07&amp;amp;desc=The+view+from+the+top"&gt;Jerusalem Post article&lt;/a&gt; gives the year of death as 1938.) The Wikipedia entry for "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel"&gt;Immanuel&lt;/a&gt;," meanwhile, expands on the Hebrew etymology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immanuel&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Emmanuel&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Imanu'el&lt;/strong&gt; (Hebrew &lt;strong&gt;עִמָּנוּאֵל&lt;/strong&gt; "God [is] with us" consists of two &lt;span&gt;Hebrew&lt;/span&gt; words: אֵל (&lt;span&gt;’El&lt;/span&gt;, meaning 'God') and עִמָּנוּ (ʻImmānū, meaning 'with us'); &lt;span&gt;Standard Hebrew&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ʻImmanuʼel&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;span&gt;Tiberian Hebrew&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ʻImmānûʼēl&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many historical figures named &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel"&gt;Emanuel/Emmanuel/Immanuel&lt;/a&gt;, and many more with the Spanish/Portuguese variant &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_(name)"&gt;Manuel&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows why Castro finds the name so baffling, but at least it provides fodder for some fine stream-of-consciousness prose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234798754182"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4007">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9361c38e1abbc0d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="bank" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="banking" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="financial crisis" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">Time for the Government to Stop Subsidizing Shareholders of Insolvent Banks</title><published>2009-02-16T15:11:30Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T15:14:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/time-for-the-government-to-stop-subsidizing-shareholders-of-insolvent-banks/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/time-for-the-government-to-stop-subsidizing-shareholders-of-insolvent-banks/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/time-for-the-government-to-stop-subsidizing-shareholders-of-insolvent-banks/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">That is what Andrew Rosenfield argues for in this extremely cogently argued piece, and I agree with him.

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/hugo_award.jpg" alt="Hugo award"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hugo is science fiction’s Oscar; an award given out to the best books that came out the previous year. I was really surprised a few years ago when I saw some people were trying to get my &lt;em&gt;Bad Astronomy book&lt;/em&gt; nominated in the &amp;quot;Best Related Book&amp;quot; category. It didn’t get nominated, though, but I had to laugh when the book that did win for that category was written by two friends of mine (&lt;em&gt;The Art of Chesley Bonestell&lt;/em&gt;, a book I own and love).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it occurred to me that maybe a book I wrote recently might qualify for this category. Thing is, you can’t just nominate or vote, you have to have attended or supported last year’s World SF Con in Denver last year (Denvention) or attend or support the Anticipation con this year (having done so by January 31).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, the blatant beg: any BABloggees out there who read my book, liked it, and qualify, I would surely appreciate it if &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies&lt;/em&gt; were in the running. &lt;a href="http://www.anticipationsf.ca/pub/hugos/nominations.php"&gt;Here’s the nomination form with the rules&lt;/a&gt;. I’d love to win it, of course, but seriously just being able to say &amp;quot;The Hugo Nominated Book&amp;quot; would mean the world to me. I’ve been a con-attending nerd my whole life, and the Hugo is, well, it’s a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks. The nominations close on February 28.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234789127378"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/what_did_i_talk_about_in_colum.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/64d30355cad211bb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">What did I talk about in Columbus this weekend?</title><published>2009-02-16T11:58:27Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T11:58:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/JI5Ag0KX6_g/what_did_i_talk_about_in_colum.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/what_did_i_talk_about_in_colum.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's at least &lt;a href="http://izgad.blogspot.com/2009/02/atheist-convention-in-columbus.html"&gt;one account on the web now&lt;/a&gt; — this one is from a theist and critic, though, so you know he must be all wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/what_did_i_talk_about_in_colum.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/JI5Ag0KX6_g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234787709277"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=479">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b42c3a28aaccf89a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">Neanderthal Genome</title><published>2009-02-16T12:00:38Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T12:00:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=479" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Scientists have completed a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7886477.stm"&gt;“first draft” of the neanderthal genome&lt;/a&gt;. This is exciting on many levels. One of the burning questions of paleoanthropology is the relationship between humans and our closest cousins, the Homo neanderthalensis. Debate has gone back and forth over years, but this is a debate that can be resolved with evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we have taken a good peek at the neanderthal genome, what do we find?  Svante Paabo, speaking at the AAAS, reports that his team could not find any evidence of interbreeding between neanderthals and humans. This does not mean there was absolutely no cross-species hanky panky, but it does mean that it was rare and contributed minimally to the human genome. There still might be a mutation or two to be found contributed to the human genome from neanderthals - or contributed to the neanderthals from humans. But the big question has been answered - the two populations did not merge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that neanderthals and early Homo sapiens co-existed in Europe for thousands of years. We are extremely close genetically, sharing &amp;gt;99% of our genome and having the same number of chromosomes, so humans and neanderthals would almost certainly have been able to breed and have fertile young. We also know that humans survived and spread throughout the world, while neanderthals became extinct about 30,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fact has lead to another burning question - why did they go extinct. The Darwinian bias is to think that they were unfit in some way, or were outcompeted or perhaps hunted to extinction by humans. This may be correct, and competition (in the absence of interbreeding) probably played some role. But it is interesting how deeply the “fitness” bias runs. I have seen dozens of documentaries on evolution, and it seems the running commentary cannot help to portray new emerging species as better and stronger, and species on the way out as feeble and inferior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, most species are just adapted to their local environment. The most common respnose to a changing environment is to migrate - habitat tracking. When that fails, the second most common response is extinction. Speciations tends to occur in small subpopulations on the fringes of a species’ range. Most species that go extinct were just unlucky - their environment changed and they could not migrate to a similar environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are therefore not inherently superior to neanderthals just because we survived and they didn’t.  However, having said that - there is independent evidence (other than the mere fact of our survival) that humans did have skills neanderthals lacks. Our tools were more sophisticated, and human tribes had a division of labor that may have made them more efficient. Also, only humans left behind evidence of art. There is no neanderthal art. From this we might infer a more nimble or expansive intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth is, we don’t really know. This remains an area of investigation and researchers are slowly exploring not only how humans and neanderthals differed, but how those differences may have related to differential survival. It is not always as simple as it may seem to make this connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question that has arisen as a consequence of sequencing the neanderthal genome is the possibility of cloning a neanderthal. While Paabo and others are saying this is not possible anytime soon - it eventually will be. We are already working on cloning the mammoth and recently extinct species like the Tasmanian tiger. One of the factors that affects how easy or difficult it will be to clone an extinct species is whether or not they have a close living relative - the closer the better. Mammoths have elephants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, neanderthals have humans. I already stated that there is little difference between the human and neanderthal genomes. If we identify all those difference we could then close a neanderthal from a human by making the necessary changes. While it is difficult to say how long it will take for this technology to emerge, it is almost an inevitability. It will happen sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, the real question becomes one of ethics. The ethical issues will probably take much longer to work out than the technical ones.&lt;/p&gt;

At that time, in England, this actually constituted quite a lot of exposure to science, since the newspapers and television contained quite a wealth of scientific content. Nevertheless, I didn’t have real access to more direct experiences, and I certainly didn’t know scientists personally, or visit laboratories at a local university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sole exception to this were the trips to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodrell_Bank_Observatory"&gt;Jodrell Bank&lt;/a&gt;, 35 miles or so from our home, that my parents and grandparents would occasionally take me on. It is so long ago that I don’t really recall every detail of these trips (this was way before I had even taken any kind of real science classes), although I do remember actual working scientists explaining how some of the equipment worked, and what some of the exhibits they had out for visitors were. What has clearly stuck in my mind though, over all these years, is the planetarium. I remember sitting there in the dark, the night sky whirling overhead, and one of those booming planetarium voices describing the sheer absurdity of the sizes and distances involved,  and just flat-out loving it! It isn’t what made me a cosmologist, but it is one of my first recollections of being enthralled by what we as humans can actually figure out about the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Jodrell bank was much more than a planetarium - it is an important astronomical facility, contains the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world, and is a treasure of British science. Despite this, the facility was almost closed last year, and remained open only after a phenomenal public outcry. &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; details this, and the exciting ongoing science at Jodrell Bank in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/feb/02/jodrell-bank-lovell-telescopes-astronomy"&gt;a recent article by James Randerson&lt;/a&gt;. As someone who was inspired as a child by Jodrell Bank, it is wonderful to see it going strong and safe from closure (at least for now). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other thing I remember about Jodrell Bank is that it appeared in a famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Who"&gt;Dr. Who&lt;/a&gt; episode (the last one starring Tom Baker as the Doctor). The reason that the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; article caught my eye is that it is accompanied by a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/feb/02/lovell-telescope-jodrell-bank-astronomy"&gt;“Science Facts and Science Fiction” piece&lt;/a&gt;, also by Randerson, detailing the history and highlights of the observatory. And indeed there it was, in the middle of the article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 1981 episode of Doctor Who, the Doctor’s fourth incarnation, played by Tom Baker, fell to his death from a walkway at the Lovell telescope. He regenerated into Peter Davison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed by another sci-fi link that I had completely forgotten, but was delighted to be reminded of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Jodrell Bank scientists missed the alien invasion because they were having a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really should visit there again some day!&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, when you plant just one crop, you reduce the amount natural control of pest insects by beneficial insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/12/09/minilivestock/"&gt;corn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/10/13/biofuels-article-in-nature/"&gt;ethanol&lt;/a&gt; before here–the change in the US landscape is dramatic, and will continue, unless legislation is changed.  We are threatened by what one writer calls &lt;a href="http://e360.yale.edu/content/feature.msp?id=2063"&gt;“The Corn-Ethanol Juggernaut”&lt;/a&gt;–in order to meet Congressionally mandated production goals, we must plant more corn.  8 &lt;em&gt;BILLION&lt;/em&gt; gallons of ethanol are to be in use by 2012.  This paper quantifies some of what that will cost us.  From the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Increased demand for corn grain as an ethanol feedstock is altering U.S. agricultural landscapes and the ecosystem services they provide. From 2006 to 2007, corn acreage increased 19% nationally, resulting in reduced crop diversity in many areas. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological control of insects is an ecosystem service that is strongly influenced by local landscape structure. Here, we estimate the value of natural biological control of the soybean aphid, a major pest in agricultural landscapes, and the economic impacts of reduced biocontrol caused by increased corn production in 4 U.S. states (Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin)……&lt;br&gt;
Recent biofuel-driven growth in corn planting results in lower landscape diversity, altering the supply of aphid natural enemies to soybean fields and reducing biocontrol services by 24%. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This loss of biocontrol services cost soybean producers in these states an estimated $58 million y&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in reduced yield and increased pesticide use. For producers who rely solely on biological control, the value of lost services is much greater. These findings from a single pest in 1 crop suggest that the value of biocontrol services to the U.S. economy may be underestimated.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, more pesticides, less profit for the farmer. Not good.  Is congress likely to repeal or change the ethanol mandate? Um. Probably not, alas.&lt;/p&gt;

How do you know? Would they agree with you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- generally it comes down to either not wanting to,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if they don't want to, but they really believe they will be punished by experiencing the worst thing ever after they die, then they are crazy aren't they?&lt;br&gt;Its like they are headed into a burning building but don't believe they will get burned right?  Are they crazy, or do they just not believe anything will happen?  &lt;br&gt;In the case of the burning building, we can demonstrate that something will happen. We can demonstrate that they are crazy and should be restrained from harming themselves.  In the case of God, we can't.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a person be blamed for not believing in something?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Where is the tipping point between a simple agreement to accept and a belief?  A belief is an unconscious commitment to an idea.  A belief is something that you can't change consciously.  It is an unconscious decision.  But it will be demonstrated by the action of the person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- or insisting that if God doesn't follow their rules, he doesn't exist. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are Gods Rules?&lt;br&gt;What are your friends Rules?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;More importantly, what are YOUR rules?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is the difference in those rules?  How many of those rules match up with each other?  What is the overlap?  I'll bet a lot of the compassionate ones do and a lot of the barbaric ones do not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it GODS rule to blame people for not believing?&lt;br&gt;Is it YOUR rule to blame people for not believing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it GODS rule to blame people for not understanding?&lt;br&gt;Is it YOUR rule to blame people for not understanding?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are GODS responsibilities to get people to believe?&lt;br&gt;What are YOUR responsibilities if you want someone to believe anything?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are GODS responsibilities to get people to understand?&lt;br&gt;What are YOUR responsibilities to get someone to understand something?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it GODS rule that he will make defective products?&lt;br&gt;Is it YOUR rule that you will make defective products?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do your Rules match up with Gods?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;What are the differences?  How does the percentage of how many of your rules match gods compare with how many of your friends rules match Gods?&lt;br&gt;If he has no responsibility, and he understands us better than anyone, what was the point in making us at all?  What is the point of making defective products?  So that they can NOT PERFORM the actions that they are NOT ABLE to perform because they are defective?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ask yourself why is it that Microsoft outperforms Christianity in the adoption of its product, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;or electric light bulbs or blood donation, or chemotherapy or vaccinations.  Its because by way of experience, people make the commitment unconsciously that it is the right thing to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;If god can't get better than 35% adoption rate over 2000 years for his product, its his own fault. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;But thats what we would expect if the hype doesn't match the experience.  If the experience matched the Hype, you'd see as many Christians as Automobiles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;- All I can do is testify that for me, it's obvious;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can see the horse in the clouds.  Can you? &lt;br&gt;I believe that it has all the characteristics of a real horse, but do you? &lt;br&gt;I will walk into that burning building (rhetorically speaking)  because I don't believe anything will happen, will you?  &lt;br&gt;Why would I do that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why do you believe and the other 65% of the world doesn't?  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If its true, why are you in the minority worldwide in your belief in the product of Christianity?  If it represents the real world, why do so many people disregard it?  &lt;br&gt;Maybe they've cross-checked it with other data and discovered irreconcilable discrepancies?  &lt;br&gt;Or maybe 65% of the world is Crazy and you aren't?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We communicate daily via email with Charlie's teacher and she makes regular home visits, and we visit her classroom. We try, as much as we can----because it seems inevitable that   "behaviors" and other issues arise, sometimes altogether unexpectedly---to set up plans and procedures via a &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/discipl.index.htm#fba"&gt;Behavior Intervention Plan&lt;/a&gt; in Charlie's &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/iep.index.htm"&gt;IEP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were any such procedures taken regarding &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10-year-old_arrested"&gt;Ian Garvin&lt;/a&gt;, the 10-year-old boy in Florida who was arrested last week after kicking and hitting a teacher? Certainly these are not appropriate behaviors, but certainly there are pro-active ways to address these in a child, rather than calling---as happened in Florida---the cops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict of another case involving special education students and a special education teacher also leads me to wonder, what is going on at some of the public schools in the US?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana O'Neill----a former Venice School District special education teacher for 18 years----was &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/dont-hit-your-head-teacher-allegedly-said-to-student/"&gt;accused of hitting, kicking and otherwise abusing&lt;/a&gt; four severely developmentally disabled students between October 2007 and January 2008. Last Friday, O'Neill was found not guilty of four child abuse charges, according to the February 14th &lt;a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090214/ARTICLE/902140367/2055/NEWS?Title=Teacher_found_not_guilty_of_hurting_students"&gt;Herald-Tribune&lt;/a&gt;. This decision is hard to fathom for me as the parent of a special education child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill did acknowledge that she sarcastically called the students names, including calling one child named Olivia "Oblivia," and another child "tons of fun." O'Neill also said that she sometimes "bopped" them on the head with water bottles, boards and objects to get their attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the parents of the children---who are unable to speak due to the severity of their disabilities---testified against O'Neill, who took the stand herself on Friday and "described herself as a dedicated teacher who drinks six cups of coffee every morning and gets excited at even the most minor accomplishments of her students."  Educators from Venice Elementary School were "split over whether the actions O'Neill was accused of taking were appropriate teaching methods"---did they say that any of the above were?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecution's case relied heavily on the testimony of classroom aides Tammy Cooke and Cindi Anderson, who spent three months keeping a detailed log of times they say O'Neill abused her students. There were also other school employees who say they saw O'Neill get too rough with her students over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But defense attorneys argued that the aides mistook appropriate techniques for working with students with disabilities for abuse. They also repeatedly pointed out that no one came forward sooner to report that O'Neill was abusing her students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some members of the jury did not seem to know what is an "appropriate" teaching method in a special ed classroom. Of the overly physical nature of the O'Neills "methods," one juror said "'Maybe that is what you need to do to teach those kids.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it's all right for me to say, it's definitely not what you have to do----definitely not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dogma that I’m referring to is the remaining practice of using NG tubes in anyone with upper gastrointestinal surgery (liver, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, proximal small intestine) and then placing a jejunostomy tube (a tube, also often called a J-tube, that goes into the jejunum, or the proximal part of the small intestine, through which feedings can be given). The rationale for this was that the peristalsis of the small bowel returns almost immediately; it’s the large bowel and stomach whose return of peristalsis is delayed. Consequently, liquid tube feedings, it was thought, could be given beyond the point of surgery into the small bowel because if there is one surgical dogma that the evidence generally supports and probably always will, it’s always better to use the gut for nutrition than to use total parenteral nutrition (TPN, or feeding by veins). Moreover, there was evidence that such feedings had a protective effect on the lining of the bowel, preventing a phenomenon known as bacterial translocation, in which bacteria could pass through the compromised lining of the bowel after surgical stress. The price, however, was the placement of a tube into the proximal intestine, a procedure that, while safe, was definitely not without complications, some of which (such as bowel perforation) could be serious and require reoperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Challenging this dogma is the largest multicenter randomized study yet looking at this question: Which is better, bowel rest (NPO) and J-tube feedings or just letting the patient eat the next day? The study comes out of Norway&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.annalsofsurgery.com/pt/re/annos/abstract.00000658-200805000-00001.htm;jsessionid=LQDTGFBQ8ys44j6JKzQMqQ32L3zJvDk9cVJ23wMGrGx55YvtL3Gn!-1809387994!181195628!8091!-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and involved 453 patients. Blinding, much less double blinding, was, as is the case in many surgical trials, not possible because of the very nature of the question being examined, but other than that the design of the study was about as strong as a surgeon could ask for. Basically, patients were randomized to a routine of NPO and J-tube feeding until flatus indicated return of bowel function versus normal food at will beginning on postoperative day one; the experimental design is summarized below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Figure1.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/Figure1.jpg" width="450" height="601"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient mix was pretty well controlled for, with similar patient mixes in each group. The results were striking. In the enteral feeding (ETF) group, 33.5% had major complications compared with 28.2% of the patients allowed normal food at will, a difference that was not statistically significant. In the ETF group, 15.2% of patients required reoperation while 13.2% in the normal food at will group did, again a difference that was not statistically significant. There was similarly no difference in mortality. Moreover, time to resumed bowel function was actually shorter in the normal food group. Specifically, time to first flatus was 3.0 days in the ETF group and 2.6 days in the normal food group, which was statistically significant. Of course, whether a less than half a day difference is clinically distinguishable is debatable, but at the very worst there was no difference between the groups, and NG tube reinsertion was only required for vomiting in the regular food group about 20% of the time.. Certainly, there was no different between time to first bowel movement, and hospital stay was actually slightly longer in the ETF group (16.7 days versus 13.5 days, p=0.046). Worse, there was a definite complication rate from the J-tube insertion, with 2/224 patients in the ETF group requiring reoperation to deal with such complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about this study was that it was a heterogeneous group. Indeed, it was not, as most such studies, limited to elective surgery but rather included emergency surgeries, including ones that involved gross contamination of the peritoneal cavity with gastrointestinal contents. The subgroup analysis that could be done failed to find a difference between the two groups even for these sorts of emergency operations. On the other hand, the very heterogeneity of the two groups, with multiple different operations, including pancreatic, liver, spleen, and stomach operations, leaves open the possibility that the results may not apply for every upper abdominal operation. Specifically, there were few esophageal operations in the mix because surgeons were reluctant to sign up patients undergoing esophageal operations for the trial. Indeed, for esophagectomy, the general standard of care right now is to wait at least two or three days and then obtain a swallow study in which the patient swallows radioopaque contrast and is filmed on fluoroscopy to make sure there are no leaks at the anastomosis. If there is no leak, the patient is allowed to have liquids and then to eat. Personally, I can’t blame them. If I still did esophageal surgery, I’d be reluctant to allow my patients to eat normal food on postoperative day one as well. However, given the results of this study, if I still did esophageal surgery, I’d be much more receptive to letting my patients sign up for a followup trial to look specifically at whether it’s safe and efficacious to let patients undergoing esophageal surgery eat so soon after their operations. I would hope that esophageal surgeons would now feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of this study that is of interest is the whole question of whether feeding a postoperative patient makes a difference. Unfortunately, it can’t clearly answer the question of whether providing “optimal” calories by an enteral route leads to a better outcome, a question that has been debated for many years, with a number of studies suggesting that enteral feedings are associated with a more rapid return of bowel function and fewer complications. The reason is that the authors did not record the actual food intake of either group. As the &lt;a href="http://www.annalsofsurgery.com/pt/re/annos/userLogin.htm;jsessionid=LQhhX13dn1nC2pvjpsQLvrX6j91JnLdWGfLn2hpGzq6xZnlSGdXg!-1809387994!181195628!8091!-1"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt; observes, “Unfortunately, the authors did not actually measure food intake in patients in either group to determine if &lt;em&gt;allowing&lt;/em&gt; food actually resulted in patients &lt;em&gt;taking in&lt;/em&gt; food during the first five postoperative days.” Still, this study is quite important because it’s the largest of its kind and it’s about as well-designed as such a study can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longstanding surgical dogma that NG tubes are necessary after abdominal surgery an that it’s dangerous to feed patients until flatus has returned has been under a sustained assault by a number of large studies over the last decade or so. The last holdout of this dogma has been the case of upper GI surgery, where it was still believed that bowel rest, often with NG tube decompression. The first to fall was the use of NG tubes after non-GI operations, such as gynecological procedures, followed by most colon operations. This study strongly suggests that neither bowel rest, NG decompression, nor the witholding of food is necessary after upper GI surgery as well, with the possible exception of esophageal surgery. Another surgical dogma appears to be on the verge of biting the dust in the face of evidence from well-designed clinical trials. Moreover, if this trial is correct, if anything, it suggests that immediate feeding is actually better than the old way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that this would disturb me. It doesn’t. What it does is to demonstrate in a very striking way the very best of science-based medicine: The ability and willingness to change practice based on new evidence. I won’t kid you by claiming that such shifts in dogma ever come easy. It will likely be several years before enough replications of this study convince upper GI surgeons that not feeding their patients the next day after major abdominal surgery is at least as safe as the old way. Dogma may not change in the face of evidence as fast as we would like, but on the other hand if it would also be undesirable if dogma changed too easily. Contrast this to so-called “alternative” medicine, where, no matter how much evidence shows its nostrums to be no better than a placebo, its practitioners hold on to them all the tighter. Surgeons and other evidence-based practitioners may be sometimes too slow to give up their dogmas, but eventually they will heed the call of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

We will clean up the blog after one of these events, but I request that when a troll makes a comment that it be ignored because If a troll makes one comment and it gets 2 responses, then 66% percent of the mess is caused by well meaning guests. It takes less time to only have to clean up after the troll.  This is simply something we'll have to live with as long as we permit real time free and open discussions.&lt;div&gt;

This has sparked protests, applause, and no behaviorial change at all from the many students who didn’t even notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students and faculty returned to campus after winter break to find that Boston College had quietly completed, without announcement or fanfare, an eight-year project to dramatically increase the presence of Roman Catholic religious symbols on campus. The additions are subtle but significant, as the university joins other Catholic institutions around the nation in visibly reclaiming its Catholic identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a private school so they can do whatever they want, but considering they deliberately chose not to advertise it, it smells foul. It’s almost like they knew they were doing something wrong that would anger a lot of their students but decided to squander all that tuition money anyway. . .just quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;High take-up rates of the infant measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has led to the elimination of the endemic measles virus in Australia, immunisation experts say. Researchers from the University of Sydney, writing in the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation, claim that in 2005 and 2007, Australia satisfied the main criteria of having a low level of measles infection, with less than one case per million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way to go, Australia! Now unfortunately, there have been some obstacles along the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 125 cases were reported in 2006 - equivalent to six cases per million - but more than half of these were attributed to a outbreak linked to the tour of a foreign spiritual group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned spiritual group was a &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Measles-outbreak-linked-to-Amma-faithful/2006/05/05/1146335903781.html"&gt;traveling Hindu spiritualist who gave hugs to people everywhere he went&lt;/a&gt;. . .in addition to giving them a deadly disease, proving once again that religion kills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool. Now if only certain people would stop making up nonsense about vaccinations…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are occasional setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 125 cases were reported in 2006 - equivalent to six cases per million - but more than half of these were attributed to a outbreak linked to the tour of a foreign spiritual group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The gradually increasing list had a few hundred names of scientists in fields that where understanding Evolution wasn’t a requirement, which sounds like a big number to laypeople until you consider how many scientists there are total, which it’s safe to say is many, many millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a rather comical response, the scientific community started to collect their own list of scientists who accept Evolution, only to illustrate how confident they were that they had the greater numbers (as if that really matters in science) they decided to deliberately handicap themselves by only including the names of scientists that accept Evolution AND who have a name that is some variation of the name “Steve.” So Stephens, Stephanies, Stefons, etc. The thinking was that Steves make up only 1% at most of the total population,  so it could be argued that every Steve on their list was the possibly the equivalent of 100 other scientists that could have been on the list if only their name happened to be a Steve name. And that list, dubbed “Project Steve” quickly outnumbered the creationist without having to resort to the 100:1 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now Project Steve has hit a milestone. &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/steve-1000-name.html"&gt;It’s reached 1000 names&lt;/a&gt;, and how ironic that Steve #1000 just happens to bare the name Dr. Steve &lt;strong&gt;Darwin&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s safe to say this puts the final nail in the crucifix of the silly list of creationist scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Project Steve for epically owning the creationist’s lame appeals to authority.&lt;/p&gt;

Measles outbreaks eliminated in Australia!</title><published>2009-02-16T06:13:54Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T06:13:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/15/wow-measles-eliminated-in-australia/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is incredible: &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2009/02/11/2487452.htm"&gt;Australia has eliminated the risk of large measles outbreaks for the next few years&lt;/a&gt;. At least, this is the prediction based on past cases, and by lowering the age for children to get the second inoculation from four years old to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2005 and 2007, Australia had less than one case per million people. 2006 had an uptick with 6 cases per million, but half those cases are claimed to be attributed to an &amp;quot;outbreak linked to the tour of a foreign spiritual group&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spiritual group&lt;/em&gt;, eh? Hmmm. Antivaxxers? Bet on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it’s predicted that large outbreaks will be eliminated. They’ll have fewer than 100 cases per year across the continent, and those will be due to unvaccinated foreigners, who love to ruin everyone’s day. The key here is to maintain the number of people getting the second shot, so that herd immunity rules the day and outbreaks are minimized or eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australians continue to amaze me. They do seem to be infected with our own nuttiness — creationism is getting a toehold there, for example, and homeopathy is a plague — but in general they seem to be a pragmatic and bonzer group of blokes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia: good on ya!&lt;/p&gt;

As I've &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;pointed out before&lt;/a&gt;, I used to be somewhat of a supporter of NCCAM. I really did, back when I was more naïve and idealistic. Indeed, as I mentioned before, when I first read Wally Sampson's article &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;Why NCCAM should be defunded&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it a bit too strident and even rather close-minded. At the time, I thought that the best way to separate the wheat from the chaff was to apply the scientific method to the various "CAM" modalities and let the chips fall where they may.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two developments over the last several years have led me to sour on NCCAM and move towards an opinion more like Dr. Sampson's. First, after its doubling from FY 1998-2003, the NIH budget stopped growing. In fact, adjusting for inflation, the NIH budget is now contracting. NCCAM's yearly budget remains in the range of $121 million a year, for well over $1 billion spent since its inception as the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1993. Its yearly budget contains enough money to fund around 75 to 100 new five year R01 grants, give or take. In tight budgetary times my view is that it is a grossly irresponsible use of taxpayer money not to prioritize funding for projects that have hypotheses behind them that have a reasonable chance of being true. Scarce NIH funds should not be for projects that have as their basis hypotheses that are outlandishly implausible from a scientific standpoint. Second, I've seen over the last few years how NCCAM is not only funding research (most of which is of the sort that wouldn't stand a chance in a study section from other Institutes or Centers)) but it's funding training programs. Indeed, that was the core complaint against NCCAM: that it facilitates and promotes the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=28"&gt;infiltration of nonscience- and nonevidence-based treatments&lt;/a&gt; falling under the rubric of so-called "complementary and alternative" or "integrative" medicine into academic medicine. However, NCCAM cannot do otherwise, given its &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/about/ataglance/"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Explore complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Train complementary and alternative medicine researchers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Disseminate authoritative information to the public and professionals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If, in fact, NCCAM actually did devote itself solely to "rigorous science" with regard to "alternative" healing practices, I would have much less problem with it than I do. However, it broadly interprets the second and third parts of its mission. For example, it views part of its mission as promotion, rather than study: "Supporting integration of proven CAM therapies. Our research helps the public and health professionals understand which CAM therapies have been proven to be safe and effective." This would be all well and good if NCCAM had as yet actually proven any CAM therapies to be at least effective, but &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;it has not&lt;/a&gt;. Worse, it has not even managed to demonstrate any of them to be &lt;em&gt;ineffective&lt;/em&gt;, either, thus leading to endless studies of modalities that either do not work or at the very least would have marginal efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I thought; All questions of promotion of CAM modalities aside, least there's the science. Surely, under the auspices of the NIH, NCCAM must be funding some high-quality studies into CAM modalities that couldn't be done any other way. That thought died when NCCAM announced last week the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/research/extramural/awards/2007/?nav=rss"&gt;studies that it had funded during FY 2007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_national_center_for_complementary_an.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_national_center_for_complementary_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/5b0LW0MggHA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234762355764"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b47b0a425fd14731</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">AIG Bailout</title><published>2009-02-16T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/aig.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Did the U.S. Congress support a bailout of financial giant AIG because that company insures the Congressional pension trust?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234761934311"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/a_smorgasbord.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/514c3dc530f1993a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">A smorgasbord....</title><published>2009-02-16T04:23:59Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T04:23:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/7f6u_KcMdbs/a_smorgasbord.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/a_smorgasbord.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being quite busy lately, I accumulated a lot of links to stuff I wanted to comment on but never found time.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the pervasive secrecy of the Bush-Cheney administration, and the sorry consequences of that disposition, President Barack Obama's early emphasis on openness in government seems almost inevitable. One of the first official communications issued by the new administration, on Jan. 21, ordered government agencies to adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure when responding to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and called for new FOIA guidelines to replace those promulgated under Bush. A later directive instructed the heads of all government agencies to strive for "transparency and open government." Ornamenting the first order was a quotation from the great progressive reformer Justice Louis Brandeis: "Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After years in trouble, American newspapers are finally up against the wall.

&lt;p&gt;Advertising, vanished. Profits, gone. Losses, mounting very rapidly. Around the country, newsrooms are being hollowed out, papers are shrinking, some are letting go of daily publication. Some are going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what if? What if your local newspaper just disappeared? In a world of red ink, bankruptcies, layoffs and cutbacks, it's possible. So, what then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/02/bush-oral-history200902" title=""&gt;Farewell to All That: An Oral History of the Bush White House &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The threat of 9/11 ignored. The threat of Iraq hyped and manipulated. Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. Hurricane Katrina. The shredding of civil liberties. The rise of Iran. Global warming. Economic disaster. How did one two-term presidency go so wrong? A sweeping draft of history--distilled from scores of interviews--offers fresh insight into the roles of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and other key players. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-na-onthemedia15-2009feb15,0,2822675.column" title=""&gt;At Voice of San Diego, a newsroom flourishes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;With several big-city dailies facing closure and the cover of Time last week pondering the fate of the American newspaper, I listened to young Voice of San Diego journalists talk about their work with words like "exhilarating," "fulfilling" and "fun." My tiny, ink-sotted heart soared.

&lt;p&gt;The lessons out of the sunny offices on Point Loma appear to be these: A local news site can flourish on charitable donations. It helps to have one big benefactor to get things started. It makes more sense to cover a few topics well, rather than a lot poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/books/review/Dizikes-t.html" title=""&gt;Political Science&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behind him hangs a copy of Jacques-Louis David's celebrated portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, the French chemist. Varmus is one of our leading scientific figures, a Nobel Prize-winning cancer researcher who advises President Obama, but I'm not sure this is an auspicious image. Lavoi­sier's own entanglement in politics led to his beheading during the French Revolution. Thankfully, Varmus seems quite adroit in public matters. He has also written a perceptive book about science and its civic value, arriving as the White House renews its acquaintance with empiricism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2009/02/do-we-need-science-journalists.html" title=""&gt;Do we need Science Journalists? &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For one, as far as I am concerned most scientists are not particularly good writers (I include myself in that) and since I appreciate a piece of good writing I sincerely hope professional journalism will prevail. Having acquired the necessary skills and appropriate education certainly helps to this matters. I don't know what Bora's standards are, but I find the vast majority of science blogs not particularly well written (YOU obviously belong to the minority of brilliant writers).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1879169,00.html" title=""&gt;Why Facebook Is for Old Fogies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Facebook is five. Maybe you didn't get it in your news feed, but it was in February 2004 that Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, along with some classmates, launched the social network that ate the world. Did he realize back then in his dorm that he was witnessing merely the larval stage of his creation? For what began with college students has found its fullest, richest expression with us, the middle-aged. Here are 10 reasons Facebook is for old fogies:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=whats_the_matter_with_teen_sexting" title=""&gt;What's the Matter With Teen Sexting?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's unclear from this exchange what Gladstone believes kids need to be protected from or what issue Balkam is solving. But neither of them came to the logical conclusion of the Harvard study: that we should back off, moderate our fears, and stop thinking of youthful sexual expression as a criminal matter. Still, Balkam wants to call in the cops.

&lt;p&gt;Maybe all that bullying is a mirror of the way adults treat young people minding their own sexual business. Maybe the "issue" is not sex but adults' response to it: the harm we do trying to protect teenagers from themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article5733405.ece" title=""&gt;Republican Taliban declare jihad on Obama&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Democrats and the liberal base have responded to all this with a mixture of cynicism and their own partisanship. They rolled their eyes at Obama's outreach to Republicans; they hated the inclusion of the other party in the cabinet and had to swallow hard not to complain about the postpartisan rhetoric. Their cynicism is well earned. But my bet is that Obama also understands that this is, in the end, the sweet spot for him. He has successfully branded himself by a series of conciliatory gestures as the man eager to reach out. If this is spurned, he can repeat the gesture until the public finds his opponents seriously off-key. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/opinion/15pubed.html" title=""&gt;A Balancing Act on the Web &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;LAST week, I wrote that a hastily published article on The Times's Web site highlighted a fear in newsrooms that the Internet, with its emphasis on minute-to-minute competition, is undermining the values of print journalism, which put a premium on accuracy, tone and context.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/politicalconnections.php" title=""&gt;An Eternal Optimist -- But Not A Sap&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obama is a long way from matching the achievements of Lincoln and Roosevelt, of course. (If Obama, and the country, is lucky, he won't have to.) But his common inclination to "steer from point to point" may serve him and the country well, especially since Obama has inherited problems of a magnitude faced by few of his predecessors other than those two titans. Obama recognizes the obvious challenge those problems present, but also sees in them opportunity. "I think that there are certain moments in history when big change is possible... certain inflection points," he said. "And I think that those changes can be for the good or they can be for the ill. And leadership at those moments can help determine which direction that wave of change goes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone is always saying: how can we fix the problem as long as the people we have in charge are the people who created the problem in the first place? Very true in many ways. I've said it a lot myself. But this point has brought it home to me in a much more concrete way. The assumptions, the vested interests, the wealth, the political power are just too much to overcome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15Battier-t.html" title=""&gt;The No-Stats All-Star &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The virus that infected professional baseball in the 1990s, the use of statistics to find new and better ways to value players and strategies, has found its way into every major sport. Not just basketball and football, but also soccer and cricket and rugby and, for all I know, snooker and darts -- each one now supports a subculture of smart people who view it not just as a game to be played but as a problem to be solved. Outcomes that seem, after the fact, all but inevitable -- of course LeBron James hit that buzzer beater, of course the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Super Bowl -- are instead treated as a set of probabilities, even after the fact. The games are games of odds. Like professional card counters, the modern thinkers want to play the odds as efficiently as they can; but of course to play the odds efficiently they must first know the odds. Hence the new statistics, and the quest to acquire new data, and the intense interest in measuring the impact of every little thing a player does on his team's chances of winning. In its spirit of inquiry, this subculture inside professional basketball is no different from the subculture inside baseball or football or darts. The difference in basketball is that it happens to be the sport that is most like life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal" title=""&gt;Legal Guide for Bloggers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether you're a newly minted blogger or a relative old-timer, you've been seeing more and more stories pop up every day about bloggers getting in trouble for what they post.

&lt;p&gt;Like all journalists and publishers, bloggers sometimes publish information that other people don't want published. You might, for example, publish something that someone considers defamatory, republish an AP news story that's under copyright, or write a lengthy piece detailing the alleged crimes of a candidate for public office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between you and the reporter at your local newspaper is that in many cases, you may not have the benefit of training or resources to help you determine whether what you're doing is legal. And on top of that, sometimes knowing the law doesn't help - in many cases it was written for traditional journalists, and the courts haven't yet decided how it applies to bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/14/nouriel-roubini-only-way_n_166980.html" title=""&gt;Nouriel Roubini: Only Way To Save US Banking System Is To Nationalize It&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The U.S. banking system is close to being insolvent, and unless we want to become like Japan in the 1990s -- or the United States in the 1930s -- the only way to save it is to nationalize it.

&lt;p&gt;As free-market economists teaching at a business school in the heart of the world's financial capital, we feel downright blasphemous proposing an all-out government takeover of the banking system. But the U.S. financial system has reached such a dangerous tipping point that little choice remains. And while Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's recent plan to save it has many of the right elements, it's basically too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winextra.com/index.php/2009/02/10/the-internet-new-media-old-media-and-fame/" title=""&gt;The Internet, New Media, Old Media and Fame&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is fame? When you use the word the majority of people would start rhyming of names like Angeline Jolie, Rock Hudson, JFK and even now with Barak Obama. Fame is often thought of as being the thing that actors, musicians, politicians and in very rare cases regular people can achieve through their actions. Old Media thrives on famous people because of their ability to get people to fork over their money time and time again. This type of fame though is what I would refer to as global fame. It is a fame that can cross generations and oceans but it isn't the only kind of fame there is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winextra.com/index.php/2009/02/12/woohoo-blogging-is-dead/" title=""&gt;WooHoo! Blogging is dead&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course this is all because Dan Lyons pontificated in Newsweek - which he also pointed to from his  blog  - that that there is no money to be made with blogging. Of course his idea of making money is something that probably has to surpass his salary from Newsweek who I am sure gave him the big high five over the post.

&lt;p&gt;I won't bother re-hashing all the different ways that Lyons probably profited quite well from his short stint as a blogger. After all how many times can you say book deal, better paying job with more name recognition or even all the speaking dates before you get the idea that Mr. Lyons is pretty well full of shit. Sure he used the lousiest ad network out there and really only clued into the fact that there were better ones months before he supposedly shut down the Fake Steve Jobs blogs out of  respect  of the Real Steve Jobs health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://publishingtrends.blogspot.com/2009/02/5-things-we-learned-about-teens-at-toc.html" title=""&gt;5 Things We Learned About Teens at TOC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;They hung out with real teenagers in their homes to get a look at their creative processes. When choosing which teens to follow, they looked for those who were creative, but not necessarily planning to go into art or design after high school. They picked those who were involved in interesting self-expression activities and who were creating digital media to share with others outside their immediate circles of friends. Here are five not-so-obvious takeaways (beyond the fairly apparent "Teens want to create identities for themselves online" and "In general, teens are pretty tech-savvy"). (The panel didn't focus much on book publishing, but it provides useful background to YA publishers who want a better look at what their target audiences are doing online.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A word about peer review. This is the process whereby journal editors send manuscripts to experts in the field for their evaluation of scientific soundness. Based on the comments, editors then make a decision as to whether to publish or not. That decision may or may not be the same as the reviewers'. There are many considerations whether to publish something or not (is it of sufficient interest to the readership or does it make enough of a contribution to the field, for example). In general, however, depend on reviewers for the science. Most journals do closed, anonymous reviews. This means that the authors don't know who the reviewers are and the reviews are not provided to the readers. Often the names of the authors are also kept from the reviewers so as not to prejudice their judgment. Some journals (like the one I edit) practice open review, meaning that reviewers' names are known to the authors (and vice versa) and that the reviews themselves are available to readers when the paper is published. In the case of the Wakefield paper we don't know the names of the reviewers or what they said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There's been quite a lot of discussions going on lately about author identification: Raf Aerts' correspondence piece in Nature (doi:10.1038/453979b), discussions on FriendFeed, ... The issue is that it can be hard to identify who the actual author of a paper is if their name is very common. If your name is Gudmundur Thorisson ("hi, mummi") you're in luck. But if you are a Li Y, Zhang L or even an Aerts J it's a bit harder. Searching PubMed for "Aerts J" returns 299 papers. I surely don't remember writing that many. I wish... So if a future employer would search pubmed for my name they will not get a list of my papers, but a list of papers by authors that have my name. Also, some of my papers mention jan.aerts@bbsrc.ac.uk as the contact email. Well: you're out of luck, I'm afraid. That email address doesn't exist anymore because I changed jobs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If I had any advice to offer it's this -- get in the habit of communicating directly with the people you want to influence. Don't charge them to read it and don't let others interfere with your communication. Talk through your blog as you would talk face to face. You'd never stop mid-sentence and say "But first a word from my sponsor!" -- so don't do that on your blog either. I can't promise you'll make any money from your blog, and I think the more you try the less chance you have. Make a good product and listen to your customers to make it better, and use the tools to communicate, and you may well make money from the whole thing. To expect the blog alone to pay your bills is to misunderstand what a blog can do. You'll only be disappointed like Dan Lyons was. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Government should have no role in funding scientific research. I say this as a person who not only greatly admires scientific research and its accomplishments, but as a person who believes strongly in the scientific enterprise in general--by which I mean, someone who believes that reason is the only proper means of knowledge and who has no truck with religion and tradition and authoritarianism. Just to get my bona fides out of the way, I am seriously devoted to and interested in all forms of science, particularly biology, and have written at great length in defense of science and the material and intellectual--indeed, spiritual--progress it has brought us. Of all the kinds of corporate welfare, I am least opposed to science welfare. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/02/why_its_good_for_us_to_fund_sc.php" title=""&gt;Why it's good for us to fund scientific research.&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Tim Sandefur and I don't agree about the proper role of government when it comes to funding scientific research. He fairly strongly believes that there are many reasons why it's wrong for the government to fund scientific research. Tim's provided a number of reasons to support his belief, and I agreed to use my blog as a platform to make my own case for the involvement of government in science.

&lt;p&gt;In the abstract, many of the reasons that the government should not be involved in funding research sound fairly compelling. Unfortunately, those arguments were made on the internet. At the end of the day, the medium undercut the message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mike Dunford starts out his rebuttal cleverly pointing to the Internet as an example of the way government-subsidized research can help promote the American standard of living. Of course, it's true that some of the research projects government has funded have ended up producing some pretty cool things. But it doesn't undercut the message: in fact, this example makes two important points that support my position.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This week of all things Darwin seemed like a good time to share some news about a project I've been working on for the past few months. It's a book called The Tangled Bank: An Introduction to Evolution.

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for the book came from a conversation I had last year with the folks at Roberts &amp;amp; Company, a publishing company. They had noticed a growing number of classes about evolution for non-biology-majors, and asked if I&amp;#39;d be interested in writing a textbook for them. I was excited by the prospect of being able to bring together the things I&amp;#39;ve learned and written about over the past few years, as evolutionary biologists have made a string of surprising new advances in understanding the history of life (many of which I&amp;#39;ve written about here at the Loom).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A new document classification is creating confusion and drawing fire from the bibliometrics community. Confusion over the new "proceedings paper" designation in ISI's Web of Science has many questioning whether the new classification will alter journal impact factors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's also that establishment journalists get disoriented by any story that doesn't fit into their pre-formed cookie cutter narratives. They spend all their adult lives inside the bubble and just can't relate in a real way to the rest of the country - as you've written about... Maybe a few of them can perceive the realness of public anger that is the fuel for social movement politics, and maybe those few can perceive the actual threat to the Establishment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/100-scientific-twitter-friends" title=""&gt;198 Scientific Twitter Friends&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Follow me on twitterI've been on Twitter since June 2007 and have met a lot of interesting, helpful, and generally nice people on there. Many of my almost 1400 friends and followers on twitter are connected with science in some way, they're scientific tweeps in other words, or to coin a phrase, scientwists.

&lt;p&gt;Originally, I listed 100 science types, but then more friends and followers asked if they could be on this list, so now we have almost 200. If you're a scientwist and want to join them then tweet me, comment here, follow me, or retweet&lt;br&gt;
this link bit.ly scientwists be sure to let me know and I'll add your link and bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/paper_chase_a_qa_with_randy_si.php" title=""&gt;Paper Chase: A Q&amp;amp;A with Randy Siegel&lt;/a&gt; (search blogs, twitter and friendfeed for this article, to see why it is very wrong):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Absolutely. It's the infrastructure, it's the professional training, it's the ability to condense massive amounts of information into accessible prose for the reader and the online visitor. It's the editing. I mean, this notion that you don't need editors anymore is laughable. Editors make things accessible for readers and online users, and they help educate all of us about stories and issues that we otherwise might not see. I highly doubt that your favorite blogger, for example, is in a position to fly to Iraq and cover what's going on there, or to fly to the far East and decipher our relationship with China as an economic superpower, or to go into City Hall and expose instances of municipal graft and corruption, or to get behind the scenes of a major sporting event and help people understand why a game turned out the way it did. I believe that, in journalism, you get what you pay for. And quality journalists will always have a role in our society. And as newspaper companies evolve, great journalism will now be more important than ever. Across multiple platforms.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/battle-plans-for-newspapers/?hp" title=""&gt;Battle Plans for Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Virtually every newspaper in America has gone through waves of staff layoffs and budget cuts as advertisers and subscribers have marched out the door, driven by the move to the Web and, more recently, the economic crisis.

&lt;p&gt;In some cities, midsized metropolitan papers may not survive to year's end. The owners of the Rocky Mountain News and The Seattle Post-Intelligencer have warned that those papers could shut down if they can't find buyers soon. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis recently filed for bankruptcy. The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News will soon stop home delivery four days of the week to cut operating costs. Gannett, which owns 85 daily newspapers in this country, recently said it would require most of its 31,000 employees to take a week of unpaid leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What survival strategies should these dailies adopt? If some papers don't survive, how will readers get news about the local school board or county executive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://i9606.blogspot.com/2009/02/non-anonymous-peer-review.html" title=""&gt;non-anonymous peer review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I spent this afternoon acting as a voluntarily non-anonymous peer reviewer - its scary.  I ended up advocating rejection of the article I was reading and I have to say that Vince Smith(see end of linked post) was absolutely right that the act of signing your review "keeps you in check".  Knowing from the outset that your words are going to be linked to your name can really change what you have to say - it certainly makes you think about it for a while longer.  It is scary though - I hope that I managed to convey enough of my reasoning and suggestions for ways to improve the article that the authors don't despise me and attempt to ruin my life...  I also hope that the editors of the journal manage to acquire at least one additional reviewer for this manuscript - safety in numbers! Or perhaps the editors will strip my name from my comments?  Time will tell I guess.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tweetbysnailmail.com/" title=""&gt;SnailMailTweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;mail us a tweet, we'll post it on Twitter&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bobmassie.wordpress.com/2009/02/07/breaking-news-why-the-new-york-times-and-harvard-should-merge/" title=""&gt;Why the New York Times and Harvard Should Merge&lt;/a&gt; (someone wrote a good rebuttal of this, but now I can't find who and where? - Oh, found it: &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/newspapers-are-just-like-motherfucking-universities/" title=""&gt;PhysioProf&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But both of these are really points on a continuum. Journalists have found that in addition to breaking stories, they need to do analysis. Academicians have discovered that in addition to reviewing the past, they need to pay attention to the the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/IT-Management/11-Ways-Print-Journalism-Can-Reinvent-Itself/" title=""&gt;11 Ways Print Journalism Can Reinvent Itself&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Print journalism is in a tailspin. Embracing the Web is the obvious solution, but how is that best done? Lex Alexander, who spearheaded a well-regarded new media effort at the Greensboro, NC, News &amp;amp; Record, offers these tips. Notice that a few start with the word &amp;quot;invest,&amp;quot; which is counter to much recent industry wisdom. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/stimulus-package/obama-aides-rip-cable-news-dc-media-and-political-elite/" title=""&gt;Obama Aides Rip Cable News, D.C. Media And Political Elite&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here's an interesting dynamic: The yawning gap between what the pundits say about who's winning the stimulus war and what the  polls say the public thinks has created an opening for the  Obama team to reclaim Obama's campaign outsider mantle, which had slipped away during the transition to governing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jdupuis.blogspot.com/2009/02/if-you-dont-have-blog-you-dont-have.html" title=""&gt;If you don't have a blog you don't have a resume (Part 1)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The point here is to make the case that blogging is good for your career. It's been good for me and it's been good for a lot of other people and I think it has potential for everyone.

&lt;p&gt;Now, is everyone a blogger-in-waiting? Of course not. Would absolutely everyone actually benefit from blogging? Probably not. And if absolutely everyone did take up blogging, would the massive amount of noise generated actually cancel itself out and end up hardly benefiting anyone at all? Probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, let's take a look at what's been making me think about blogging lately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jdupuis.blogspot.com/2009/02/if-you-dont-have-blog-you-dont-have_09.html" title=""&gt;If you don't have a blog you don't have a resume (Part 2)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I'd also like to be more explicit about chicken/egg of interplay between our passion and commitment to the profession that blogging brings out and how that directly feeds into concrete reputation-building and the benefits that may result. In general, I believe that if you blog to become famous (in other words, to explicitly build your reputation, with cynicism not passion), that will be your reputation. If you blog to share and grow and explore, it's that passion that will hopefully influence your reputation-building efforts and that any concrete benefits that you accrue will reflect that.

&lt;p&gt;Blogging isn't for everyone. Blog because it's what you want to do, not because you feel you have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I really I really like how bluntly Neville Hobson puts it: Your Blog is Your CV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/2009/02/yet_more_on_uneasy_symbiosis_o.php" title=""&gt;Yet more on uneasy symbiosis of mainstream and citizen journalism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rosen's much stronger and emphatic point, meanwhile, is that the blogosphere v MSM argument isn't getting us anywhere, so, follks, quit beating this question by attacking "the other." I could not agree more. The point is not which is better or deserves to die or has great or lousy ethics or good or awful writers. It's that they bring different strengths and weaknesses and possibilites and constraints, we'll make the best of both realms if we try to cross-fertilize strengths while avoiding or improving upon weaknesses.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/a_smorgasbord.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/7f6u_KcMdbs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234761140990"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-9037612044884793618">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a58fc7adcc3ca83e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="spiritual abuse" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="exmormon" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="recovery from religion" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="expentecostal" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="exfundamentalist" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="exChristian" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="skeptic" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="deconversion" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Seven Steps to Recovery</title><published>2009-02-16T04:16:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T06:30:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/jfs7bSWLNpk/seven-steps-to-recovery.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/9037612044884793618/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=9037612044884793618" title="7 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/seven-steps-to-recovery.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Hello Everyone,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a summary outline I've come up with for recovering from authoritarian religions like fundamentalist Christianity.

If you feel guilty, realize that the religion teaches you to feel responsible when it isn’t working and tells you to go back and try harder, just like an abusive relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;2.  Get a Grip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t panic. The fear you feel is part of the indoctrination. All those messages about what will happen to you if you leave the religion are a self-serving part of the religion. If you calm down, you’ll be just fine. Many people have been through this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;3.  Get Informed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do everything you can to educate yourself. You are free to read and expose yourself to all the knowledge in the world – history, philosophy, other religions, mythology, anthropology, biology, psychology, sociology, and more. In particular, read about how the Bible was put together and church history. Read authors who have explained why they deconverted. Many websites have deconversion stories and helpful reading lists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;4.  Get Help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find support in any way you can. Explore online forums to discuss issues with others leaving their religion. Join a supportive group in your area. If necessary, find a therapist who understands or go to a recovery retreat. Do the work to heal the wounds of religious abuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;5.  Get a Life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebuild your life around new values and engage fully with your choices. Develop your identity as you learn to love and trust yourself. Take responsibility and create the life that works for you – in work, family, leisure, social – all the areas of commitment that make a life structure.  If you still want a spiritual life, define it for yourself.   Venture into the “world” for new experiences and new friends. This will take time but you can do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;6.  Get With the Program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the human race.  Accept the idea that Earth is your home and humanity is your true family.   If you aren't part of a special group that is leaving, consider what that means for you.  You may want to participating in larger concerns to make the world a better place, such as caring for the environment or working for social justice.  Let go of expecting God to take care of all the problems.  You can begin with knowing your neighbors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;7.  Get Your Groove On. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reclaim enjoyment of sensation and pleasure as you relax with the idea of being an animal like all the others on Earth. Learn to be present here and now. Discover all the ways to appreciate nature. Enjoy and love other people instead of judging. Reclaim your creativity and express yourself any way you like, not just to “glorify God.” Love your body and take care of it. Embrace this life instead of worrying about the next. Sing and dance and laugh for no reason except Being Alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marlene Winell, Ph.D., is a psychologist who works in religious recovery, and the author of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion. &lt;/span&gt; Information about counseling services and weekend retreats can be found at marlenewinell.net&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a survey conducted recently, 75% of British people don’t get Charles Darwin. Astounding. That’s three from four. That’s most of the two-legged beings you are liable to meet. That’s almost everyone at the check-out. That’s most of your blood relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise, however. Reportedly, these folk harbour “doubts” as to natural selection. They incline instead towards myths with a comforting whiff of refutation and brimstone. They are otherwise persuaded, despite a ton of evidence. People, as ever, believe what they want to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, though, they also demonstrate, at a monkey-never-typing-Hamlet stroke, that there might be less to this evolution business than the brochures claimed. Chimps will be chimps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking as a monkey’s uncle’s less popular nephew, I don’t mind. If I have read Darwin half-way right, employing both opposable thumbs to prop up the book, natural selection depends on a majority always missing the point. Then we kill and eat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they tell me, while approving miracles, canonising the extra-holy, opposing stem cell research, and abortion, and birth control, and gay people, and bad words, and the simple ability to think independently, that natural selection is only a theory. Only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the man said, natural selection in action.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;If I seem to quote Pieret a lot, it’s because he finds this stuff faster than my Google News traps.)&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) A tremendous fireball — also called a bolide, or a very bright meteor — was seen in southern Texas on Sunday, February 15th, just before 11:00 a.m. local time. Many people have described it as very bright, small, and moving rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://www.news8austin.com/content/top_stories/default.asp?ArID=232081"&gt;A video of the fireball has been released&lt;/a&gt;, taken by a person videotaping a footrace. The video matches the description of many eyewitnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Some people have attributed this event to debris from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/12/kablam-satellite-collision-math-and-a-correction/"&gt;the two satellites that collided over the Earth last week&lt;/a&gt;. I was initially very skeptical of this, then relented a bit. Now I am sure it was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; debris from the satellites. Why? OK, that deserves it’s own number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) The video shows the fireball to be moving very rapidly. Typically, meteors come into Earth’s atmosphere at 20-50 km/sec (though they can be moving much faster), and burn up 50-100 km high. Man-made space debris re-entering is moving at slower than orbital speed so the max speed is about 8 km/sec. It also burns up lower, and generally you can see flames and whatnot coming off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen man-made debris re-enter, and it’s very different than natural meteors. The difference in speed is very obvious. Right there, that’s enough to make me think this was a single natural object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to get collisional debris moving more rapidly, but it’s difficult. The two satellites closed in on each other at about 10 km/sec, and any shrapnel from that event would most likely be moving at roughly that same speed. If one satellite slammed into, say, an antenna first, then the lower mass antenna might get a pretty hefty acceleration from it, but the amount of energy dumped into it would most likely turn it into a bunch of teeny pieces (remember, the energy of impact was like several tons of TNT). A small object would not have been as bright as the fireball seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, you’d have to have a pretty special set of circumstances to get any debris from the satellites to re-enter our atmosphere so soon after the collision. It’s far more likely that it will be months before we see any of that shrapnel burning up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all, I am pretty sure what was seen was natural: a rock or a piece of metal from an asteroid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/product.php?site=JKL&amp;amp;product=PNS&amp;amp;issuedby=JKL"&gt;A fireball was reported in Kentucky Friday night&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unlikely these two events were related; if the Texas bolide were from a natural object, then it was a totally different object that entered over Kentucky.  At a speed of, say, 20 km/sec, the two objects would have been separated by more than 100,000 km, making a connection pretty far-fetched. And if they were from the satellite collision, again being separated by a day makes it unlikely they were connected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) This was certainly unrelated to &lt;a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090214/debris_calgary_090214/20090214?hub=SciTech"&gt;a NORAD warning of a Russian booster re-entering&lt;/a&gt;, which later was determined to have fallen near Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) There were reports that an FAA official had confirmed this object was from the satellite collision. But those reports never gave a name! &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/02/15/america/Falling-Debris.php"&gt;When a report came in&lt;/a&gt; naming Roland Herwig, he was quoted as saying it was &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; from the collision. Still the false confirmation spread like wildfire via Twitter, when a popular breaking news account stated it as fact (no provenance was ever given for that quotation). Rumors spread rapidly, truth far more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, why the FAA? They are not the go-to agency for this. NORAD would make far more sense, since they specifically track such things. And there was no warning at all from them, indicating once again this was not from the satellite collision. Any piece big enough to be bright enough to be seen in broad daylight is big enough for them to have been tracking for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a fascinating event, both astronomically and socially. I received an email less than an hour after the event from a reader (who, wonderfully, gave both his exact location and the direction to the fireball) as well as a tweet about it. Within a few minutes I had a post up and tweeted about it myself. I started to receive dozens of tweets over the next hour (I’m not sure how many total, but probably well over 100) with information. After an hour or so the misinformation (FAA officials, satellite debris, etc.) started coming in. Someone posted on iReport their own description, and added a photo of a totally different event as an example, and at least ten tweets referred to it as the actual Texas fireball. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using various websites that track keywords on Twitter helped enormously. I could look for &amp;quot;Texas&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fireball&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;satellite&amp;quot;. That was tremendously helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As info came in I updated the blog post, but that was awkward. Tweeting info is fine, but a more permanent and easily-accessible repository was needed. Now, after the fact, I can collate that info and make a more linear post. If someone has a better way to collect, disseminate, and store breaking astronomical news, I’m all ears. Between the blog and Twitter I think this went pretty well, with a minimum of bad information being spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time goes on I’m sure more video and pictures will surface. I’ll post links to those as I find them. My personal thanks to everyone who saw this event and tweeted, or left comments. This was very exciting!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234743621357"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4159">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d8883be2e21a37f8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="asagray" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Asa Gray"/><category term="darwin" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Darwin"/><category term="ontheoriginofspecies" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="On the Origin of Species"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="evolution"/><title type="html">Asa Gray&amp;#39;s Review of OoS</title><published>2009-02-16T00:22:37Z</published><updated>2009-02-16T00:42:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/asa-grays-revie.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/02/when-the-theory.html" rel="external "&gt;Andrew Sullivan&lt;/a&gt; links to &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/186007/gray" rel="external "&gt;Asa Gray’s original review&lt;/a&gt; of Darwin’s OoS in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; in July 1860.  Interesting reading.  Gray, one will recall, was a distinguished  American botanist at Harvard.  He was an early supporter of Darwin, an antagonist of Louis Agassiz at Harvard, and was a devout Presbyterian who one might call the first theistic evolutionist.

The grant could be used specifically towards "teaching students on the autism spectrum" in the form of training for teachers. With the numbers of students with an autism spectrum diagnosis increasing, school districts have been using the funds to support in-district programs by providing training for teachers and also behavior analysts and other autism specialists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/02/15/autism_programs_take_a_hit/?page=1"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; notes that, from 2006 to 2007, the special education budget rose in Lowell from 10.1 percent of the total education budget to 14.4 percent; in Acton, from 20.8 percent to 23.3 percent; in Tyngsborough, from 18.8 percent to 19.5 percent.  Lowell has 180 students on the spectrum out of a total student population of 13,500; Acton has 25 students on the spectrum; Tyngsborough has 24 students on the spectrum out of 2,200 total students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the  &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2009/02/15/autism_programs_take_a_hit/?page=1"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; article doesn't specifically mention the economic crisis and any effects it may be having, it does note that administrators are hopeful that the President's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/how_much_will_your_school_district_receive_under_the_stimulus_plan"&gt;economic stimulus bill&lt;/a&gt; will provide some assistance. In my own district, hiring for almost all positions in the schools has been frozen and administrators are being asked to make cuts. Special ed has yet to be touched. If you're in the US, is your school district hoping that the stimulus plan might provide some much-needed assistance? And whether you're in the US or elsewhere, how has the recession affected the services for your child or for you?&lt;/p&gt;

(A wonderful film, too; the whole script is interesting and intelligent as well as funny and appealing, and Penelope Cruz&amp;#39;s electric, chew-up-the-scenery portrayal of a deranged artist is incredible — near Oscar level.)  But what a strange syntactic move Woody made in naming the picture.  The three names are just concatenated: Vicky is one of the girls, Cristina is the other, and Barcelona is the city where most of the the action is located.  There&amp;#39;s absolutely no grammatical warrant for that at all.  For example, although you can interpret &lt;i&gt;Celery, apples, walnuts, grapes&lt;/i&gt; as an asyndetic coordination (a conjunction without an overt &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;), the commas are obligatory in written English: *&lt;i&gt;Celery apples walnuts grapes&lt;/i&gt; is not grammatical at all.  And similarly, it would be possible to interpret &lt;i&gt;Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona&lt;/i&gt; as a coordination with three coordinates; but the string &lt;i&gt;Vicky Cristina Barcelona&lt;/i&gt; doesn't have that privilege.  It's got the written-English syntax of a single personal name.  (Dougal Stanton, here in Edinburgh, noticed&lt;br&gt;
today that the people running the Cameo on Home Street were confused enough to abbreviate it to &amp;quot;Vicky C. Barcelona&amp;quot; on their large signs — exactly as if it were somebody&amp;#39;s name.) Woody is thinking right outside of the syntactic box.  (Which is OK, of course, for an artist. This is an observation about innovative syntax, not a correction or a criticism.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

He arrives at this number by extrapolating from the number of stars in the Milky Way - 200-400 billion is the current estimate, but some argue this figure could be higher. And from the number of exoplanets discovered (340 so far). I don’t know the specific calculations he used, but he estimates that there is one earth-like planet per stellar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of speculation is part of what is called the Drake Equation, after Dr. Frank Drake, which is the formula for calculating the number of technological civilizations in the galaxy or the universe.  Some have criticized the Drake Equation of being pseudoscience, but I think this misses the point. The equation simply lays out those variables that would need to be known in order to make such a calculation - number of stars, percentage with earth-like planets, percentage of those planets with life, etc. Using the equation to calculate a specific estimate of the number of technological civilizations is mostly speculation, not hard science - but the equation itself is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the AAAS presentation Boss was  focusing on one variable in that string of variables - the percent of stars with earth-like planets. However he has taken on the entire Drake Equation in the past - he is the author of&lt;a href="http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0465009360"&gt; The Crowded Universe&lt;/a&gt;, a book in which he argues that we will soon find many earth-like planets and we will discover that life is common in the universe. Although, he argues, it is probably mostly simple life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may be right - I hope he is. The universe will be eve more interesting if it is replete with life. I do not think, however, that we currently have enough information to speculate as confidently as he has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many earth-like planets are out there is somethin that we will soon have much more information about. In March the Kepler mission will launch. This is a satellite that has the capacity to fin earth-sized planets around nearby stars. Once we start actually conducting a survey with equipment sensitive enough to do this, we will be able to say with much more confidence how many earths are out there. It seems that in a few years we will start finding them, and in about a decade we will be able to say within reasonable error bars how many earths there probably are in the Milky Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugging this more acurate figure into the Drake Equation will certainly help, but is still a long way away from knowing how much life there is out there. I always took for granted that our solar system is probably fairly representative. This has proven to be a reasonable assumption. It could be wrong, we could be the victims of a statistical fluke and just happen to inhabit an unusual system. Or perhaps life can only exist in an unusual system. Maybe life by definition exists in rare systems. Even still, one earth per stellar system has long been a default assumption, so if this turns out to be correct no one will be surprised and this will not have rocked the Drake Equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other variables in the Drake Equation always seemed much more speculative to me. How likely is it for life to form in a suitable environment. Are we the result of an incredibly unlikely sequence of events, or does life rapidly and inevitably appear. Or - does life already seed the universe (frozen in chunks of ice) and rain down on all newly forming worlds? Life did appear within millions of years of earth’s surface cooling. While this is a long time, it is fairly rapid on planetary time scales. This suggests life is common - but still there is great uncertainty. It’s just hard to extrapolate from one point of datum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why it would be so fascinating to find life on Mars or perhaps on Europa or another moon of Jupiter or Saturn. If life sprung up in even one more location in our solar system that means it is probably not exceedingly rare or unlikely (unless of course it arose in one location and then seeded the other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if life is common, we have no idea how often life will evolve a complex central nervous system which further evolves the collection of skills that leads to the kind of intelligence required for advanced technology. Again - trying to extrapolate from our one source of information, earth, it seems like this is very unlikely. Only one twig of the vast evolutionary bush (ours) managed to do this over several billion years of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Boss speculates that life is common, but probably mostly simple life and not technological, or even multicellular. Bacteria may rule the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find such speculation interesting, and it is a completely legitimate scientific endeavor, as long as one does not pretend the error bars are smaller than they are. Also, at least in the case of the number of earth-like planets in the galaxy, it can be tested. In the next decade we will put Boss’s predictions to the test. I do look forward to the day I can blog about the discovery of the first truly earth-like exoplanet being discovered.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234733874363"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/best_of_january.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/163d7fdb89d2439f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Best of January</title><published>2009-02-15T19:57:22Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T19:57:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/wYNt3w_ihkc/best_of_january.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/best_of_january.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, it's middle of February, but I was busy and neglected my duties.

Grey's deepsea smelt.  While looking around the relevant website (Hans G. Hansen's &lt;a href="http://www.tmbl.gu.se/libdb/taxon/personetymol/petymol.g.html"&gt;Biographical Etymology of Marine Organisms&lt;/a&gt;), I noticed something oddish.  The Latinized name &lt;i&gt;greyae&lt;/i&gt; didn't surprise me much, because &lt;i&gt;-ae&lt;/i&gt; is the genitive singular suffix of the Latin first declension, the major declension for feminine nouns in Latin.  It's maybe a bit strange from a Latin perspective, because Latin nouns in this class have a nominative singular ending in &lt;i&gt;-a&lt;/i&gt;, and like most English family names &lt;i&gt;Grey&lt;/i&gt; ends in a consonant; and Latin third-declension nouns end in a consonant, so they could've provided a model for scientific names.  Still, using the Latin first-declension ending for the possessive of a non-Latin woman's name seems like a reasonable decision, given the much greater productivity of the dominant noun class.  No, it was the genitive formation of organism names honoring men that struck me as peculiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the genitive ending &lt;i&gt;-ae&lt;/i&gt; is used in organism names honoring women, it's unsurprising that names honoring men take the suffix &lt;i&gt;-i&lt;/i&gt; — the genitive singular ending of the second declension, to which the vast majority of masculine Latin nouns belong.  But with masculine honorees there are two different formations.  For instance, among the rather numerous marine organisms named after Joseph Paul Gaimard (a French naval surgeon and naturalist, 1793-1858) are &lt;i&gt;Sycozoa gaimardi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Calcinus gaimardii&lt;/i&gt;.  (Fans of Patrick O'Brian will understand why Gaimard caught my eye: remember &lt;i&gt;Testudo aubreyii&lt;/i&gt;, which first appeared, I think, in &lt;i&gt;HMS Surprise&lt;/i&gt;?  Who knows, maybe Gaimard, like Stephen Maturin, was a spy as well as a naval surgeon and naturalist.)  I found this suffix variation puzzling, so I asked two of my colleagues to explain — Ben Fortson, an Indo-Europeanist and Latinist, and Don Cameron, a Classicist and an expert on scientific names.  Their responses were interesting.  I asked Ben where the variation came from; I also asked him whether it was peculiar to men&amp;#39;s names, because in the hundred or so entries I checked I didn&amp;#39;t find any such variation in organisms named for women.  Here&amp;#39;s Ben&amp;#39;s answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;-i-&lt;/i&gt; itself is not strictly any gender.  Latin has masculine nouns in &lt;i&gt;-ius&lt;/i&gt;, feminine ones in &lt;i&gt;-ia&lt;/i&gt;, and neuter ones in &lt;i&gt;-ium&lt;/i&gt;.  For the Latinization of the family names of men, the masculine version is what is used.  The problem is that there are two types of Roman names that roughly correspond to our family names: the gentilicium or nomen, or the name of the gens (roughly a clan), and the cognomen, which in origin was more of a nickname that stuck as a quasi-family name among certain members of the gens.  Thus in Quintus Horatius Flaccus, Quintus was the given name, Horatius the gentilicium, and Flaccus the cognomen.  This example is fairly typical in that the gentilicium ends in &lt;i&gt;-ius&lt;/i&gt; and the cognomen in &lt;i&gt;-us&lt;/i&gt;, without the &lt;i&gt;-i-&lt;/i&gt;.  The reason is that the gentilicia are often in origin patronymics, and &lt;i&gt;-ius&lt;/i&gt; was a suffix of appurtenance that could be used, among other things, to form patronymics: thus a Varius was the son of Varus, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the reason all this is relevant is that let's say you want to Latinize a non-Latin family name.  A non-Latin family name kind of corresponds to the gentilicium but also kind of corresponds to the cognomen; there's no exact equivalent either way.  So one could defensibly tack on either &lt;i&gt;-ius&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;-us&lt;/i&gt; to the non-Latin name to do the trick.  Falling into the former camp are Latinized names like Gronovius (originally Gronov), Lipsius (&amp;lt; Lips), the various Swedish and Finnish Latinized names like Berzelius, Sibelius, and so forth.  Falling into the latter camp are Copernicus (&amp;lt; Copernic), Muretus (&amp;lt; Muret), and others.  Things get mighty complicated with Romance names, since some of these genuinely continue Latin words in &lt;i&gt;-us&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;-ius&lt;/i&gt; and usually the correct one was used. This can extend to German names of ultimately Latin origin, e.g. Camerarius being the rendering of Camerer (chamberlain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutatis mutandis the same issues obtain with women&amp;#39;s last names.  The names of Roman women were just feminizations of male names (Julia &amp;lt; Julius, Augusta &amp;lt; Augustus, Octavia &amp;lt; Octavius, Calpurnia &amp;lt; Calpurnius, etc., etc.; these we think of as given names, which is what they were in Imperial Roman times, but in origin they are the feminines of gentilicia and cognomina).  There&amp;#39;s no reason from the point of view of Latin why your mother&amp;#39;s name couldn&amp;#39;t have been rendered as [nominative &lt;i&gt;Greyia&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;Greya&lt;/i&gt; (to form the genitive &lt;i&gt;greyae&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Bathylagus greyae&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben's account explains why the variation exists, but it doesn't completely clarify the practice of constructing scientific names.  That turns out to be because the practice isn't all that clear.  Here's Don Cameron's reply to my query about that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="blue"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have hit on a long-standing kerfuffle among zoologists whether masculine names in the genitive ought to be &lt;i&gt;-i&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;-ii&lt;/i&gt;.  The &lt;a href="http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp"&gt;International Code of Zoological Nomenclature&lt;/a&gt; (4th edition, Sec. 31.1.2) specifies one &lt;i&gt;-i&lt;/i&gt;, but under 31.1.3, about preservation of the original spelling, both &lt;i&gt;cuveri&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cuverii&lt;/i&gt; are admissible.  The trouble comes from different conventions of Latinizing modern proper names.  Originally in Latin names like &lt;i&gt;Marcus&lt;/i&gt; have genitive &lt;i&gt;Marci&lt;/i&gt; and names like &lt;i&gt;Livius&lt;/i&gt; have genitive &lt;i&gt;Livii&lt;/i&gt;.  So do you want to Latinize my name as &lt;i&gt;Cameronus&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Cameronius&lt;/i&gt;?  You have a choice.  Then the genitives would be &lt;i&gt;Cameroni&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Cameronii&lt;/i&gt;.  Modern custom following the Code is to use one &lt;i&gt;-i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's why we get both &lt;i&gt;gaimardi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;gaimardii&lt;/i&gt; in names honoring M. Gaimard, and why we are likely to find the same variation with other popular honorees.  Maybe it's just an accident of my small sample that I didn't find any examples of organism names with female honorees in &lt;i&gt;-iae&lt;/i&gt;.  The closest I came was &lt;i&gt;Turbonilla angelinagagliniae&lt;/i&gt; (a small gastropod that is probably shorter than its scientific name), but that's named for Angelina Gaglini, so the genitive suffix is still just &lt;i&gt;-ae&lt;/i&gt;.  From what Ben and Don told me, there ought to be some Latinized feminine names with a genitive &lt;i&gt;-iae&lt;/i&gt; too.  And Don says that the Code even provides for genitive plural forms for plural honorees, in &lt;i&gt;-orum&lt;/i&gt; (masculine) and &lt;i&gt;-arum&lt;/i&gt; (feminine).  All this makes me sorry I'm not close enough to biology or biologists to be able to look forward to becoming the species designation in the name of some insignificant organism: no critter will ever be known as &lt;i&gt;sallythomasoniae&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sally Thomason</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234729839001"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2859920220164207528">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d2dc67179378de1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Literary Darwinism</title><published>2009-02-15T20:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T20:29:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/literary-darwinism.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2859920220164207528/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2859920220164207528" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> A reader tells me that Trent University (Peterborough, Ontario, Canada) celebrated Darwin&amp;#39;s birthday with a talk by Joseph Carroll on The Historical Position of Literary Darwinism.

And while it's geared toward high school students, frankly this site would have been helpful to me when I was embarking on my most recent graduate school stint in my mid-thirties, so the information may be useful to a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College for folks on the spectrum is a particular area of interest of mine so I'm always looking for an excuse to blog about it.  I've had to trial-and-error my way through post secondary education, learning about my rights and picking up self-advocacy skills by myself, and unfortunately mostly through making (sometimes terrible) mistakes.  I'm old and have had a strange life, and the transition programs available for kids today were not available to me.  The struggle was well worth it though.  Finally getting proper accommodations was the difference between flunking about a third of my classes and barely graduating, and succeeding at my coursework with a GPA of 3.8.  It was also the difference between never communicating with a single student or teacher, and finishing up a program with a wonderful bunch of friends and professional contacts.  I don't, however, recommend the "trial and error" method to get there!  Real self-advocacy training is a must, and happily more available today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the Going to College site which provides that sort of training, the "&lt;a href="http://www.going-to-college.org/myplace/index.html"&gt;My Place"&lt;/a&gt; section is all about building self awareness and self-advocacy skills.  The "&lt;a href="http://www.going-to-college.org/campuslife/index.html"&gt;Campus Life&lt;/a&gt;" section is all about disability accommodations, including disclosure issues and assistive technology.  The "&lt;a href="http://www.going-to-college.org/planning/index.html"&gt;Planning for College&lt;/a&gt;" section is about some of the college stuff most people have to deal with such as standardized tests, and strategies for dealing with them.  The site is easy to navigate, even I understood all the language on it, and all video media is captioned and has transcripts available.  Best of all, the site is written to target the actual audience of self-advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downside, the site is by necessity limited and may not include specifically some of the things of most use to autistic students; for example the assistive technology page does not mention any AT for communication.  Students on the spectrum may need to use the site as a place to get examples rather than specific idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[As a side-bar to a lot of things, check out the site's definition of "self-advocacy" as it is the one that is always in my mind when I write about self-advocacy or refer to myself by that term (using the term "speaking" to really mean "communicating" of course as speech is not the only way to go!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does self-advocacy mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means speaking up for yourself and communicating what you need to others. It involves knowing your strengths and weaknesses, knowing what your rights are and effectively communicating through speaking and listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critically important in college, in employment, in the community, and even among friends, family, and just doing stuff by yourself!]&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234723194369"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_giants_shoulders_8_is_up.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f6d730fc6aa0e49</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">The Giants' Shoulders # 8 is up!</title><published>2009-02-15T18:13:35Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T18:13:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/WxyuGgdGzXw/the_giants_shoulders_8_is_up.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_giants_shoulders_8_is_up.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can find it on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/02/the_giants_shoulders_8.php" title=""&gt;Greg Laden's blog&lt;/a&gt;.

The meteor is moving far too quickly for that; satellite collision debris would fall at perhaps 10 km/sec max, while incoming meteoroids are moving at 11km/sec at a minimum, and this thing is screaming across the sky at several dozen km/sec (assuming it’s at a typical meteor height of 50 or more km). So I was probably right in the first place, and what we have here is almost certainly a single object, perhaps a meter or two across, and it came from deep space.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m getting reports that an extremely bright fireball was seen in broad daylight over Texas (near San Antonio and Austin) around 11:00 a.m. local time (about an hour ago as I write this). [Update: &lt;a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/product.php?site=JKL&amp;amp;product=PNS&amp;amp;issuedby=JKL"&gt;some fireball reports came in from Kentucky on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear if the KY event is connected, since it was a while back. It’s possible, so I remain agnostic for now.] If you saw anything or find links, please put them in the comments. The more reports we get on this, the more likely astronomers can figure out what this was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s part of an email I just received:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Google Earth, I was approximately at 29 deg 53′14.44″ N and 97 deg 57′32.00″ W when we saw the object.  We were traveling NE, and the object was a little further NE of us, and was travelling in a NNE direction.  It traveled out of sight quickly, and we were unable to figure out where it went from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports like that are fantastic; get your position as accurately as you can, say what direction the fireball was moving, and how high in the sky it was. Don’t worry about apparent distance; most fireballs look like they are close enough to touch, but can be dozens of kilometers away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just to be clear: &lt;del&gt;it was almost certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/del&gt; It is possible this was part of the debris from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/12/kablam-satellite-collision-math-and-a-correction/"&gt;the satellite collision last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;del&gt;That should take months or years to work its way down to our atmosphere.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Updated: There are some official agencies (like &lt;a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/product.php?site=JKL&amp;amp;product=PNS&amp;amp;issuedby=JKL"&gt;the FAA&lt;/a&gt;) saying this could be debris from the collision. I tentatively retract what I said earlier and say I might have been wrong. Still, this fireball may have been  a random piece of rock, a very small asteroid a meter or two across. We’ll know more soon– as more reports come in, we can track the direction of the debris and test it against possible de-orbit tracks of any debris from the collision. Keep those comments coming!]&lt;/p&gt;

Either he or the reporter is a bit confused; Iridium flashes are bright glints from reflected sunlight off of &lt;em&gt;intact&lt;/em&gt; Iridium satellites still in orbit around the Earth. If someone saw flashes of light as the fireball came in, it has nothing to do with that! A wrecked iridium wouldn’t make those flashes anymore (Updated update: &lt;a href="http://www.chareidio.com/detail/show/3749"&gt;a news site&lt;/a&gt; is repeating this confused description. Sigh.).

&lt;p&gt;[Update (16:30 MT): A lot of tweets were saying an FAA official had confirmed this was from the satellite collision. Now, &lt;a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2009/02/15/america/Falling-Debris.php"&gt;the International Herald Tribune reports&lt;/a&gt; FAA spokesman Roland Herwig says they &lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; it’s from the collision. I’ll note, though, that the FAA is not the agency that would know; I’d trust NORAD better. A fireball that bright would be from a big chunk, and they’d have tracked it. However, I really don’t think this was from the satellites; it was moving rapidly (deorbiting space junk tends to move far slower than incoming meteors) and in the wrong direction.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234723021623"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/15/uk-tabloids-compete-for-fish-wrappery/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2dd8ca51553c5d7d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">UK tabloids compete for fish wrappery</title><published>2009-02-15T17:42:57Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T17:42:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/15/uk-tabloids-compete-for-fish-wrappery/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whenever I wonder if US news is the worst on the planet, I just need to look east, across the Atlantic, to be reassured that we have close competition. I swear, the UK newspaper The Mirror has a bet with The Sun to see which of them can have more ridiculous articles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#mirrorfootnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest volley in this war is about (drum roll please): &lt;a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/02/14/the-dark-side-of-the-moon-40-years-after-moon-landing-the-doubts-persist-115875-21123653/"&gt;the Moon Hoax&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, The Mirror has discovered this 40 year old rotting piece of cabbage and is serving it up like a fine box wine. Breathlessly marked &amp;quot;EXCLUSIVE&amp;quot; — as if they are the first to have stumbled on this news — the article goes on and on about the usual tired and long, long-debunked claims of the Moon Hoax crowd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is slightly different than most &amp;quot;fair&amp;quot; articles on these topics in that the writer, Dennis Ellam, actually does give explanations for some of the dumb conspiracy claims, but also uses a writing tone that is somewhat sarcastically dismissive when discussing them. I’ve seen this many times; it allows the writer to fan the flames of the conspiracy while also innocently claiming that they present both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellam was pretty confused over the provenance of the conspiracy though. After a description of some of the claims, he then says, &amp;quot;But the HBs [Hoax Believers; a term I coined back in 2001] have begun to gather important allies.&amp;quot; Who would these &lt;em&gt;important allies&lt;/em&gt; be? Why, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/06/27/moon-hoax-originator-has-died/"&gt;Bill Kaysing&lt;/a&gt;! But Kaysing &lt;em&gt;originated&lt;/em&gt; the Moon hoax idea, so how could the HBs have gathered him as an ally? And Ellam, like every other conspiracy-fanner, neglects to mention that Kaysing had some pretty crazy ideas, like that any kind of space travel is impossible and that NASA blew up &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt; on purpose to keep Christa MacAuliffe from revealing the truth about NASA’s fakery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellam also quotes astronaut Brian O’Leary as saying it’s possible the landings weren’t real. That quotation — unattributed in the article, for shame — comes from &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html"&gt;the wretched Fox TV show back in 2001&lt;/a&gt;, and O’Leary claims he was taken out of context, in fact &lt;a href="http://www.clavius.org/oleary.html"&gt;now saying quite succinctly that the landings were real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellam also relates the incident where Buzz Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel as the act of a guilty man lashing out against a truth-seeker… &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/sibrel.html"&gt;when we know for a fact that Sibrel was harassing Aldrin&lt;/a&gt; and physically intimidating him. Sibrel tried to sue Aldrin for the punch, and the judge threw the case out of court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellam presents all these points in a very misleading way, but all of them are easily debunked. He could have trivially fact-checked them by contacting either me or Jay Windley (who runs the &lt;a href="http://www.clavius.org"&gt;clavius.org website&lt;/a&gt;, another Moon Hoax mythbusting site). It’s not like either of us is very hard to find when it comes to this conspiracy; perhaps &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=moon+hoax&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;typing &amp;quot;Moon Hoax&amp;quot; into Google&lt;/a&gt; was too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why bother checking your facts, backing up your claims, or doing, y’know, &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt;, when instead you can write something destined to stir controversy where none exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess, in the end, people in the UK need something to line their birdcages, and The Mirror is only too happy to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip o’ the tin foil beanie to Peter Backus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He's the go-to guy for Cambrian paleontology, and he's definitely qualified and smart, but he's got two strikes against him: he's a &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt; writer, making most of his output well-nigh unreadable, and he's one of those scientists with a serious god infection, which means much of what he writes collapses into babbling theology at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's done it again. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2009/feb/12/simon-conway-morris-darwin"&gt;Simon Conway Morris has an opinion piece in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, and it's his usual tirade: atheists are nasty people who don't think about the meaning of evolution, which is that god created us. As &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/simon-conway-morris-becomes-a-creationist/"&gt;Jerry Coyne points out&lt;/a&gt;, this makes him indistinguishable from your garden variety creationist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to follow the logic of Conway Morris. I can't. Here is the bulk of his article, with my futile attempts to dissect the chain of reasoning in his central premise. This won't be an easy exercise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn't it curious how evolution is regarded by some as a total, universe-embracing explanation, although those who treat it as a religion might protest and sometimes not gently. Don't worry, the science of evolution is certainly incomplete. In fact, understanding a process, in this case natural selection and adaptation, doesn't automatically mean that you also possess predictive powers as to what might (or even must) evolve. Nor is it logical to assume that simply because we are a product of evolution, as patently we are, that explains our capacity to understand the world. Rather the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s agree with much of this. Our understanding of evolution is far from complete, of course. No one with any sense argues that the outcomes of the evolutionary process are at all predictable — there are just too many possibilities, chance and history play too great a role, and results are always dependent on local conditions, which change. This paragraph induces great confusion in me, though, because when you read the rest of the article, and when you&amp;#39;ve read his excruciating book, you realize that Conway Morris actually claims the exact opposite: that he &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; predict the general outcomes of evolution, that human-like beings are an inevitable outcome, and that in fact, the whole panoply of life on earth follows predictable paths to a small suite of convergent solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait a moment; everybody knows that evolution isn't predictable. Yes, a rich and vibrant biosphere to admire, but no end-product any more likely (or unlikely) than any other. Received wisdom pours out the usual litany: random mutations, catastrophic mass extinctions and other mega-disasters, super-virulent microbes all ensure that the drunkard's walk is a linear process in comparison to the ceaseless lurching seen in the history of life. So not surprisingly nearly all neo-Darwinians insist that the outcomes - and that includes you - are complete flukes of circumstance. So to find flying organisms on some remote planet might not be a big surprise, but certainly no birds. Perhaps all life employs cells, but would anybody dare to predict a mushroom? In fact the evidence points in diametrically the opposite direction. Birds evolved at least twice, maybe four times. So too with the mushrooms. Both are among the less familiar examples of evolutionary convergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this is not at all correct, but Conway Morris does find another point of congruence with creationists. Most evolutionary biologists certainly do see chance and contingency as very important contributors to diversity…but &lt;i&gt;no one&lt;/i&gt; concludes that species are "complete flukes of circumstance". I'm surprised that he didn't follow through with the usual cliche about evolution being like a tornado assembling a 747 in a junkyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he leaps onto his favorite hobby horse, convergent evolution. Remember the first paragraph I quoted, where he denounces the idea that we might predict evolutionary outcomes? Here he goes again, telling us that he &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; — implying that we ought to expect birds and mushrooms on other planets. (By the way, I have absolutely no idea what he&amp;#39;s claiming when he says that birds have evolved on earth four times, independently. I&amp;#39;m actually a bit concerned that I don&amp;#39;t know what he means by &amp;quot;birds&amp;quot; — terms seem to have a certain fluidity in the oozing liquidity of his logic.) But yes, let&amp;#39;s hear more about convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convergence? Simply how from very different starting points organisms "navigate" to very much the same biological solution. A classic example are our camera eyes and those of the squid; astonishingly similar but they evolved independently. But let's not just concentrate on the squid eye, from molecules to social systems convergence is ubiquitous. Forget also the idea that in biology nearly anything is possible, that by and large it is a massive set of less than satisfactory compromises. In fact, paradoxically the sheer prevalence of convergence strongly indicates that the choices are far more limited, but when they do emerge the product is superb. Did you know eyes can detect single photons and our noses single molecules? Evolution has reached the limits of what is possible on planet Earth. In particular our doors of perception can only be extended by scientific instrument, enabling a panorama from the big bang to DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot bear it any more. I have to make a secondary complaint about Conway Morris's piece. He seems to regard the English language as an axe murderer would a corpse: as an awkward obect that must be hacked into fragments, and the ragged chunks tossed into a rusty oil drum he calls an article. Continuity and flow are something that can be added after the fact, by pouring in a bag of quicklime. Unfortunately, one difference between the two is that Conway Morris will subsequently proudly display his handiwork in a newspaper, while the axe murderer at least has the decency to cart the grisly carnage off to the local landfill for anonymous and clandestine disposal. One can only hope that someday the paleontologist will perfect his emulation and take his work to the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for convergence, Conway Morris focuses on it because it fits his desired conclusion, that biology is fore-ordained by a creator, not because it fits the totality of the evidence. I argue against the significance (but definitely not the reality) of convergence on two grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common descent tangles the interpretation of convergence hopelessly. I recommend an article in this week's &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; by Shubin, Tabin, and Carroll that argues for an important  concept of deep homology. We do see similar structures, such as limbs in insects and invertebrates, that are not at all homologous on a morphological level, but when we examine their molecular genetics, we find similar substrates for both. This is the central idea of deep homology, that we have shared primitives, a set of regulatory networks, that see reuse over and over again in evolution. So while limbs arose independently in insects and vertebrates, when we look more deeply, we find that both use the &lt;i&gt;distal-less&lt;/i&gt; developmental pathway. We see convergence because there are common functional demands that channel the solutions of selection, but there are also shared molecular constraints that limit the range of likely solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conway Morris dwells far too much on the patterns that fit his model, and ignores the importance of divergence. For instance, one can focus on the way vertebrates have repeatedly evolved fusiform shapes for aquatic life: fish, ichthyosaurs, cetaceans. There certainly &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; to be one likely answer that re-evolves over and over again. But these are all vertebrates, and that seems to be a pattern that is also a consequence of fundamentals of our body plan. But our seas are full of a very different solution: squid. Sure, they configure themselves into a streamlined teardrop shape for rapid locomotion, but they began with a very different body plan, and their solution is radically different, with long arms and jet propulsion. But then, perhaps, Conway Morris's definition of "fish" is sufficiently fluid to include squid, ignoring the differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convergence is interesting, and it does happen, but as a universal explanation for evolution, it is seriously lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet how the former led to the latter, how it was that complexity emerged and is sustained even in that near-miracle of a chemical factory we call the cell is still largely enigmatic. Self-organisation is certainly involved, but one of the puzzles of evolution is the sheer versatility of many molecules, being employed in a myriad of different capacities. Indeed it is now legitimate to talk of a logic to biology, not a term you will hear on the lips of many neo-Darwinians. Nevertheless, evolution is evidently following more fundamental rules. Scientific certainly, but ones that transcend Darwinism. What! Darwinism not a total explanation? Why should it be? It is after all only a mechanism, but if evolution is predictive, indeed possesses a logic, then evidently it is being governed by deeper principles. Come to think about it so are all sciences; why should Darwinism be any exception?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, in the welter of sentence fragments, we again see an example of convergence…between Conway Morris and creationists. There is the word &amp;quot;Darwinism&amp;quot; used as a pejorative; how often do we see that particular trope? Cells are really, really complex on the inside, full of &amp;quot;factories&amp;quot;, and he has a hard time imagining how they could have evolved without a designer — that&amp;#39;s straight from the Intelligent Design playbook. There too is the surprisingly ignorant accusation, in this case that neo-Darwinians are reluctant to use the word &amp;quot;logic&amp;quot;. If you&amp;#39;ve read Carroll&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&lt;/i&gt;, for example, you&amp;#39;ll find it uses the word frequently — there is regulatory logic (which he explains with liberal use of comparisons with computer science), developmental logic, evolutionary logic. We simply do not hesitate to point out a rational examination of the world of biology &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; reveal order and pattern! Science wouldn't work if the universe were purely chaotic. Where we differ is that we see that logic as a product of the natural properties of our universe, not as the product of a deity, but that does not mean that we deny order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is more. How to explain mind? Darwin fumbled it. Could he trust his thoughts any more than those of a dog? Or worse, perhaps here was one point (along, as it happens, with the origin of life) that his apparently all-embracing theory ran into the buffers? In some ways the former possibility, the woof-woof hypothesis, is the more entertaining. After all, being a product of evolution gives no warrant at all that what we perceive as rationality, and indeed one that science and mathematics employ with almost dizzying success, has as its basis anything more than sheer whimsy. If, however, the universe is actually the product of a rational Mind and evolution is simply the search engine that in leading to sentience and consciousness allows us to discover the fundamental architecture of the universe - a point many mathematicians intuitively sense when they speak of the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics - then things not only start to make much better sense, but they are also much more interesting. Farewell bleak nihilism; the cold assurances that all is meaningless. Of course, Darwin told us how to get there and by what mechanism, but neither why it is in the first place, nor how on earth we actually understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we get a shift in emphasis. Somehow, the evidence of convergent evolution is supposed to point to a godly plan for life, but also human consciousness, which he argues is unique, is &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; supposed to point to god. It really doesn&amp;#39;t matter what phenomenon Conway Morris discusses — common solutions or one-off oddities, they all seem to cry out &amp;quot;god!&amp;quot; to the god-soaked mind. He thinks this is interesting, but I&amp;#39;m afraid that I find postulating untestable, unevidenced phenomena like a supreme being to explain reality is a tedious cop-out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the claim that atheism implies "bleak nihilism" is yet another common canard. I am an atheist, yet neither am I bleak nor a nihilist. I know very, very few people who could even be called nihilists, but Conway Morris must find it easier to invent a caricature to rail against than to actually consider that most atheists are reasonably positive and find rationality to be a solace and an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reiterate: when physicists speak of not only a strange universe, but one even stranger than we can possibly imagine, they articulate a sense of unfinished business that most neo-Darwinians don't even want to think about. Of course our brains are a product of evolution, but does anybody seriously believe consciousness itself is material? Well, yes, some argue just as much, but their explanations seem to have made no headway. We are indeed dealing with unfinished business. God's funeral? I don't think so. Please join me beside the coffin marked Atheism. I fear, however, there will be very few mourners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I seriously believe that consciousness is a product of a natural process. I find that the neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers who proceed from that premise are the ones who are actually making useful contributions to our understanding of the mind. We have not found any property of the human mind that is not dependent on the physical substrate of the brain (which does not preclude the possibility that other factors could contribute, but no one, including Conway Morris, ever manages to stutter out a useful alternative in public. Does he want to postulate a soul? I'm sure he does. But he never quite manages the courage to state it outright.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a strange funeral Conway Morris is attending. The corpse is awfully lively, dancing about the room, courting all the pretty young boys and girls, thumbing its nose at the stuffy preacher, and jeering at the morose and inarticulate creationist standing in the corner with his shiny, unused shovel. Need I mention that we&amp;#39;ve buried a succession of gods? Apollo is gone, Zeus is no more, Thor is neglected, Dionysius is scarcely remembered (although I&amp;#39;m sure his wake was to die for), and almost all the gods people have ever worshipped are extinct. I&amp;#39;m sure Jesus will follow sometime, and this next time, there will be no resurrection — he&amp;#39;ll be the archaic myth that people only recall in literary metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atheism will only die with human reason. It could happen, and Conway Morris is right — there may be no mourners.

She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging. Because I foresaw this day coming, however, I did set up a series of "Best of" reposts to autopost for you while I am in mourning. Some I have even updated and/or spiffed up with actual editing. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. This particular one I've updated slightly. It also gives me an idea for a post about cancer which, perhaps, when I'm ready to produce new material for the blog again I'll write.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the risk of muscling in on &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2006/05/doggerel-index-suggestions.html"&gt;Bronze Dog&lt;/a&gt;'s territory, I've encountered a phenomenon that ought to be in his list of &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2006/05/doggerel-index-suggestions.html"&gt;doggerel&lt;/a&gt; but doesn't appear to be. It appeared in the comments of my post about the Arthur Allen-David Kirby debate and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/arthur_allendavid_kirby_debate_about_a_s.php"&gt;my discussion&lt;/a&gt; of how the human tendency to see patterns where none really exist, coupled with the emotional investment the parents of autistic children have in their children and fueled by unscrupulous purveyors of harmful woo like Mark and David Geier, manages to keep the myth that mercury in vaccines is responsible for the "epidemic" of autism alive. My point was not that these parents are stupid (as in any population of human beings, some are stupid, some are very intelligent, and most are somewhere in-between) but rather how the above factors can make the science that is increasingly failing to support the contention that mercury in vaccines causes autism seem at best indifferent to their plight or at worst part of the perceived conspiracy to hide the "truth from them." My comments brought a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/arthur_allendavid_kirby_debate_about_a_s.php#comment-322809"&gt;stinging rebuke&lt;/a&gt; from a reader named Steve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I love the comments from people who don't deal with autism every day diagnosing the mind set and beliefs of those that do.  I am the parent of an autistic child and I do believe mercury is a part of the issue.  I watched my son's communication and social skills diminish rapidly within a week of receiving a flu shot containing thimerasol.  I have used chealtion therapy and seen it work, I have used special diets (GFCF) and biomed supplements and seen immediate results.

&lt;p&gt;I was not anti-vaccine, I am now though having directly seen its impact.  I am not anti Big Pharma, my father worked for Big Pharma for 36 years retiring as an executive with one of the largest pharma firms in the world.  I am not looking to sue Big Pharma or the Government, I just want truthful answers from them.  Remember when smoking was not bad for you, the same will eventually come out about thimerasol and the over vaccination of our kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow the money...  You think us parents are in this for the money?  I have spent over $70,000 on my sons care the past two years in therapy, supplements and medical care.  All out of my own pocket, so to say we are in this for the money is idiotic.  I would do it all over again as well because I have seen dramatic improvements in him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you critics ever walked a day in the shoes of the parent of an autistic child your mindset would change rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/you_havent_walked_in_my_shoes_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/you_havent_walked_in_my_shoes_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/qDadPIoDjec" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234711515417"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_601.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b26fdf9be43970a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-15T13:25:17Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T13:25:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/kKo8iriwP2A/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_601.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_601.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_601.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_601.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/kKo8iriwP2A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234711511672"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4569669111162178126">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb24219807e8f3fa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Happy Valentine&amp;#39;s Day to My Wife!</title><published>2009-02-15T04:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T14:19:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/LB19MOWPuSI/happy-valentines-day-to-my-wife.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/4569669111162178126/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=4569669111162178126" title="4 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/happy-valentines-day-to-my-wife.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/YyfJfxLr3RU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[Guest post by Derek Bickerton]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I yield to no-one in my admiration of Darwin.  But admiration should not blind us to the fact that in many cases he was, inevitably, limited by the state of knowledge in his time.  Not only Mendelian genetics, but also almost the entire ancestry of humans, was wholly unknown to him; ethology and the study of non-human communication had yet to be systematically developed, and linguistics still lay in the womb of philology.  It is truly amazing, not that he was sometimes wrong, but that he was so often and so stunningly right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was right when he saw language as the seed, rather than the fruit, of human intelligence.  But appealing as the notion is, he was wrong in proposing a scenario in which language issued from a "musical protolanguage".   Tecumseh Fitch argues that his own account, developed from Darwin's, is soundly based on principles of evolutionary biology.  It is therefore somewhat surprising that his account pays as little attention to the evolution of humans (and the ways in which this evolution differed from that of other primates) as do those of biologically-naïve linguists or psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of a terrestrial and heavily-predated primate indulging in any form of vocal activity-especially one that must, in quantity as well as quality, have exceeded those of all other primates barring gibbons-is simply bizarre, as I point out in a chapter of my book &lt;em&gt;Adam's Tongue&lt;/em&gt; (out next month) devoted to the "singing ape" hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;"What could possibly have been the functions of song for a pre-human species in largely treeless grasslands?  Song as a pair-bonding mechanism is highly unlikely.  Human ancestors probably weren't monogamous-great apes aren't, and neither are we, even if we try or pretend to be, so a monogamous interval at any time in the past looks unlikely.  But suppose we did go through a monogamous period.  If two mates don't happen to be out of sight of one another up two different trees, there are countless more effective ways of bonding than yodeling at each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;"Human ancestors probably weren't territorial, either-at least not in the sense of holding small, well-defined chunks of territory.  Most likely they had a fission-fusion social structure, like that of contemporary apes, that's to say groups would be continually splitting up and reforming, merging with other groups.  In open terrain, where different groups might utilize the same areas at different times without conflict or even contact, what would be the point of noisily-defended frontiers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&amp;quot;Furthermore, the terrains in which gibbons and human ancestors lived were such that for maintaining contact sound was essential in one and useless, even dangerous, in the other…On the savanna, where there are beasts with keen hearing far larger and more lethal than our ancestors, to sing out with any frequency would have been to write one&amp;#39;s own death warrant.  Moreover, the absence of trees and the level or undulating nature of most savannas means that, in contrast with the rain-forest, animals are visible at considerable distances.  To be out of sight is, under those conditions, almost always to be out of earshot–there&amp;#39;s little point in yelling and hoping your friends will hear you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;"To assume that, even if our ancestors had sung before, they would go on singing under these conditions is absurd-something you can do only if you think that behavior and environment are completely divorced from one another… Conditions on the savanna were such that while they lived there our ancestors very probably produced less sound than our ape relatives, not more.  If this was indeed the case, a single source for music and language becomes highly unlikely. Unless, of course, someone succeeds in coming up with some function pre-humans had to perform, under those same savanna conditions, that they couldn't have performed by any means other than by singing.  It's unlikely anyone will, but never say never in science."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To persuade us of the "musical protolanguage" theory,  Tecumseh will have to come up with a scenario in which singing (of some kind) somehow increased human fitness.  Here he has proposed mother-child interaction (as already suggested by Dean Falk in a recent article, "&lt;a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=276843"&gt;Prelinguistic evolution in early hominins: Whence motherese?&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;em&gt;, Behavioral and Brain Sciences&lt;/em&gt; 27(4):491-503, 2004).  The problem with this is that all other primates have mother-child interactions, but only one has picked on this kind.  Why?   Why humans?  And this doesn't end the problems that "musical protolanguage" raises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tecumseh recognizes that the severest of these problems ("the greatest explanatory challenge for all musical protolanguage theories") is how sound acquired sense-how a continuously variable medium with no specific reference turned into strings of discrete chunks with individual meanings.  However, he skips nimbly over the solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"Supporters of the more intuitive "synthetic" model of protolanguage, in which words evolved first followed by syntactic operations for combining them (e.g., Bickerton, 1990), have subjected holistic models to extensive criticisms (Bickerton, 2007; Tallerman, 2007, 2008). However, I argue that most of these critiques miss their mark if the notion of a musical protolanguage is accepted as a starting point (cf. Fitch, in press).  Jespersen/Wray's model of holistic protolanguage thus dovetails nicely with the musical protolanguage hypothesis, in ways that I believe resolve many, if not all, of these criticisms (cf. Fitch, 2006; Mithen, 2005)."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I don&amp;#39;t have a copy of Fitch (in press), I remain in the dark as to what these ways are.  All I know is that when Dean Falk made the same proposal, I wrote a commentary that, inter alia, pointed out she gave no account of how symbolic meaning — symbolic use of  words or signs to refer to particular classes or individuals — emerged from originally meaningless sounds.  Significantly, she responded to all the points I made… except for that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggie Tallerman and I have made some very specific and pointed criticisms of the "holistic protolanguage" model, most of which have never been satisfactorily answered by anyone, as far as I know.  If Tecumseh believes he can answer them, he should show how.&lt;br&gt;
He does point out that "Darwin… embraces all three of the major leading theories of word origins of his contemporaries" but he fails to point out that at least two of these are incompatible with one another.  For according to Darwin, "the attachment of specific and flexible meanings to vocalizations required only that 'some unusually wise ape-like animal should have thought of imitating the growl of a beast of prey'" (and of course that some even wiser primates should have understood what was meant-a lion coming, or lions often hang around here, or one was seen here last week, or "Gee, guys, see how well I can imitate a lion!").  But of course this onomatopoeic proposal is incompatible with "musical protolanguage", since it avoids the holistic phase altogether and goes straight to the kind of compositional, already-symbolic protolanguage that Tecumseh rejects.  The "lion's roar" idea needs a good bit of tweaking, but at least it's nearer the mark than a holistic protolanguage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major motive behind &amp;quot;musical protolanguage&amp;quot; is Strict Continuism — the belief that language grew seamlessly from animal communication.   Animal calls — if translated into humanese, and that turns out to be a very dodgy business in itself — are, like holophrases, often the equivalents of whole clauses: &amp;quot;Mate with me&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Stay off my territory&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;Terrestrial predator coming — get up a tree&amp;quot;.   Split these into their components and for a few glorious moments it seems that the transition problem has been solved.  But in &lt;em&gt;Adam's Tongue&lt;/em&gt; I go more deeply into the transition problem than anyone ever has before.  And it&amp;#39;s the transition problem — how any species could get from a standard animal communication system to even the crudest and most basic kind of protolanguage — that lies at the very heart of language evolution, and without which all &amp;quot;explanations&amp;quot; are mere hand-waving, smoke and mirrors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.msu.edu/desk/index.php?/site/building_a_sustainable_future/"&gt;MSU President Simon’s full statement on the &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;clusterfuck&lt;/span&gt; situation:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“MSU is particularly concerned by the proposal to combine the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station (MAES) with MSU Extension (MSUE) and cut the total funding for these programs by 50 percent. Research and Extension programs are critical to the state’s effort to expand the bioeconomy and create the jobs and technologies that will fuel Michigan’s economic transformation. Agriculture is one of the few sectors in the state that is growing and adding jobs. Disinvesting now jeopardizes the future of this $64 billion industry and the state’s ability to be a significant force in developing the “green” technologies and businesses of the future. The effects will be felt in every corner of the state. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In five of the last seven years there have been significant reductions proposed for MAES and MSUE. … Last year’s $64 million in state funding helped to leverage another $148 million in external funding, which generated a total economic impact of more than $1 billion for Michigan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the proposed cuts are enacted, it would not only mean a loss of the economic impact from these leveraged funds but it would also mean the loss of approximately 1,000 jobs throughout the state.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stopped by the Twin Cities Creation Science Fair Saturday night at the Har Mar mall.  I am not a science educator so I may not be a fair judge and I don't know how the various ages should relate to their various projects.  I did not take a close look at all of them but there were some that seemed fairly decent, effects on plant growth, measuring impurities and contaminants in well vs tap water, air rifle velocity measurement, measuring wood hardness, color blindness in dogs.  There seemed to be a number experiments on dogs.  It seems house pets make convenient experimental animal subjects.  There was also a simple spectrometer made from a music CD that I had seen of before.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One experiment looked at the affect of gum chewing on memory which I thought was questionable until I googled it.  Apparently it has been studied and there is supposedly some beneficial effect.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, there were a some displays that were not much of anything.  One display essentially said nothing more than "we don't fall of the Earth because of Earth's gravity".  (I wonder what kind of force would otherwise make us fall off the Earth.  Perhaps the idea of drifting off was intended.)  Other displays were simplistic models of human digestive system, circulatory systems and such.  Some of the writing on the display boards were rather poor as were some of the experimental procedures and controls.  Displays also had their Bible quotes describing the connection to their science project.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There wasn't much creation science in the fair this year.  There seemed to be fewer creation/anti-evolution displays than past years.  I spotted only one this time which might be considered an improvement.  There was a display that made a very simplistic comparison of airplanes and helicopters with flying animals (bird, bat, dragonfly) and concluded that since the animals fly better than designed flying machines, they must also be designed.  Irreducibility was also mentioned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
One experiment I thought was noteworthy looked at the time it takes for different brands of vitamin tablets to dissolve in water to counter the claim that some vitamin tablets are passed undissolved, even through sewer systems.  (for more info, search: undigested vitamin.)  I became familiar with this false claim when I did some research of my own after some people I know tried to sell me vitamins in gel form (agel.com).  Supposedly they can be absorbed so much faster.  (Why is it better for vitamins to be absorbed quickly anyway?)  I did the same experiment myself with the vitamin brand I take.  This experiment explicitly challenged a false claim for which I give the student credit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Overall, the displays were not too different from what I have seen in previous years.  Some are decent, but the rest can range from fairly mediocre to quit poor.  But there are a few here and there that can stand out.  One year a student did experiments on people on the unreliability of eye witness testimony which I thought was quite good, but a bit ironic coming from a Bible based science fair.  I wish I could remember his Bible verse.  Maybe if I had only been chewing gum at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a fairly typical science fair, made just a little sadder by the compulsion to insert biblical apologetics into everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/creation_science_fair_report.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/0Fe1aUpT6oA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234700988085"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/16_arms_and_6_hearts_true_love.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/32ef9b1d0b4126e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">16 arms and 6 hearts = true love, for a little while</title><published>2009-02-15T11:51:58Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T11:51:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/6dHrX5aneOc/16_arms_and_6_hearts_true_love.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/16_arms_and_6_hearts_true_love.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href="https://www.seattleaquarium.org/NetCommunity/SSLPage.aspx?pid=214"&gt;Octopus Week at the Seattle Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, and to kick it off, yesterday they introduced two octopuses to each other for a public courtship. &lt;a href="http://www.king5.com/video/animal-index.html?nvid=331674"&gt;Watch the story from King 5 news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/16_arms_and_6_hearts_true_love.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/6dHrX5aneOc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234699054551"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_205.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c45c292eb679756</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-02-15T08:53:37Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T08:53:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/WZUh2T9MpE8/clock_quotes_205.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_205.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is action and passion; therefore, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of the time, at peril of being judged not to have lived. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some qualifiers are missing in that statement, mainly SCOPE and DEFINITION but also the ACTIONS of the AGENTS DOING THE SEARCH and AGENTS BEING SEARCHED FOR. What are the responsibilities of the Agents? What is the definition of "a comprehensive" search?  And how will you know when you find it?  There must be a description to go by or how will one know when they've found it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Principles Of Searching.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Searching is a comparison of a description to something else.  The more specific the search criteria are, the more likely a successful match will be found.  Its Baysian in the sense that one has to make decisions about each clue such as "what is the likelihood that I am having success given such and such indication".  But it gets even easier if a human is searching for a person, or a pet.  When they are searching for each other they take actions to expedite the search and when they see each other, they make contact in an unambiguous way.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Critical Question Generators: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Searle, a philosopher of mind is quoted as saying that he has a maxim that is summed up as "if you can't say it clearly, you don't understand it yourself".  I live by that and it has served me well since I first heard it.  &lt;br&gt;So now, lets get a grip on the scope of the search.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;How do you know?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- How is the search carried out?&lt;br&gt;- How will we know when we find it?&lt;br&gt;- How long should we expect to look?&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;What do you have to go on?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- What actions should the seeker take?  What are the seekers responsibilities?&lt;br&gt;- What actions should the one being sought take?  What are the responsibilities of the one being sought?&lt;br&gt;- What are we looking for? Does it exist? What does it look like, feel like, taste like, smell like, sound like?&lt;br&gt;- What are some false indictations that may fool us?&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Who says?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Who are we searching for?  Do they exist?&lt;br&gt;- Who made it? Who originated it? Who lost it? Who hid it?&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Why do you say that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Why isn't it obvious?&lt;br&gt;- Why are we looking?  What is the benefit?&lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;When did it happen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- When is it happening?&lt;br&gt;- When should the search take place? What is the best time? When was it lost? When did it originate? &lt;br&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Where did it happen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Where will it happen?&lt;br&gt;- Where is it happening?&lt;br&gt;- Where is the search carried out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its always good to check the answers to these critical questions with another pass through the critical question generator to do a "reality check".  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Searching For The Most Beautiful Work Of Art&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I challenge anyone to go find the most beautiful art work in their nearest museum.  I challenge anyone to do an experiment where peple are asked before they go in to find and report back which is the most beautiful art work in the museum.  There will not be a consensus.  A percentage of people will pick a particular work of art but not all will pick the same work of art. If they are given some criteria to look for and If the searchers report back that they've matched the criteria to a work of art, then its likely what they've identified is not what they think is the most beautiful work of art.  Its someone else's idea of the most beautiful work of art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they should be told what the criteria are, then where did the criteria come from?  Who derived them? Were they qualified to derive them?  Do the criteria accurately reflect what the seeker holds as being characteristics of the most beautiful work of art?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Searching For Jesus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if one must seek Jesus to find Jesus, and one was convinced that they found Jesus but had second thoughts, changed their mind and became an apostate, then what they found must have only matched the description superficially.  They must have made a mistake.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Searching is a comparison of a description to something else.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So since its possible to mistake something else for Jesus, the description needs to be more specific as to what it is that should be used as criteria for the search.  How will one know it?  How long should one look before one can conclude that one is not looking in the right place and have to move on?  How long should one have to look for a being that is waiting for another or maybe even looking for that other?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;If two people, pets or combination want to find each other, they take some actions to expedite the search.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why should one have to look for more than a minute for a supernatural being that can do anything to make its presence known to someone?  Why would it let someone incorrectly identify something when it knows that the seeker will become discouraged and give up in some cases?  Why is it easier for an owner to find their cat than Jesus?  I'll bet more cats have been found across all categories of people than Jesus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Search for Jesus Violates Sound Principles Of Searching. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can anyone be blamed for not recognizing what it is they are supposed to be looking for, or not finding something when they don't understand what it is they are looking for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the presumption is that God exists, then searching until he's found makes sense, but if he's waiting and looking for us, it doesn't make sense that he would hide or let himself be mistaken for something else.  If God doesn't exist, then our poor results are what should be expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Dr. Steve Darwin – no relation to Charles – has been a botanist and evolutionary biologist for over thirty years. Darwin is not only a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Tulane University in New Orleans, but also Director of Tulane’s herbarium, which boasts 115,000 specimens, with a focus on flora from the southeastern United States. He is the author of thirty-five publications in the field of plant biology.

Bobby Jindal’s creationist-friendly LA Science Education Act, the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, one of the nation’s leading scientific societies, is boycotting Louisiana. Scientists have given numerous warnings and pleas to the LA legislature, all of which have been ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislators and Gov. Jindal are the people who refused to consider the economic damage to the state that they were warned would result from their passing this bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, while Louisiana legislators will reap what they sow, it’s really the kids who will suffer the most.&lt;/p&gt;

Having thought about this quite a bit, I've concluded that, while I'm not on the spectrum, there's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_autism_in_all_of_us"&gt;a little autism in all of us&lt;/a&gt; and I am not, too, "normal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;.... the weirdo, quirky mom with the quirky kids, the mom nobody tells the gossip to because she doesn’t quite get it, the mom nobody asks to carpool because, with her distracted manner and written-on palms, she doesn’t quite inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also: The mom who always forgets it's Picture Day so my child wears a faded t-shirt while everyone else is in fancy threads. The mom who sends in weird lunches with sushi and home-cooked containers of rice and shrimp stir-fry. The mom with the handmade bag in a town where Moms Carry A Certain Brand (or knock-offs). The mom who's grading papers written in some foreign alphabet while waiting in the school office prior to an IEP meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paragraph about the "weirdo, quirky mom" is by writer Judith Warner, from her February 12th &lt;a href="http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/extraordinary-people/?ref=opinion"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; column, &lt;a href="http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/extraordinary-people/?ref=opinion"&gt;My Kind of Normal&lt;/a&gt;.  Warner reflects on her seventh-grade daughter being "different enough," from the Ugg-wearing, Miley Cyrus-adoring, girls of her age and notes that she, too, is "different":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What lessons am I teaching my child? I am not normal. She will never fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finally realized that I am weird, my whole sense of self has been decentered. I am now trying, as I did when I was 12 or 13, to figure out where I fit. I am not a normal 43-year-old woman, with a nice manicure and a well-run home. But neither am I one of those out-there moms – those sort I remember from Greenwich Village in the ’70s – who don’t care about appearances at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or am I? Have I looked in a mirror lately?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the ways in which my son is "quirky" can be said to far exceed movie and book preferences and fashion choices (Charlie doesn't stand out in the crowd in any way in this regard though he did once have a pair of frog-faced rubber rainboots of the sort Warner says her seventh grader still likes). Charlie's around the same age as Warner's daughter as he's in the sixth grade. While he attends the (large) public middle school in our suburban town, he's definitely, indelibly different. Charlie is &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/who_wasnt_watching"&gt;never unaccompanied&lt;/a&gt; by a teacher or aide; he's the kid in the special ed room who sometimes stands still for no apparent reason in the middle of the hallway, seemingly unaware of people trying to push past him. He's the kid whose voice changes from one phrase to the next from something deep and low to his familiar voice (which I know will disappear soon). He and his classmates take the little yellow schoolbus with the bus matron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I've never been "normal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California is a very diverse---ethnically, racially---place now, but I was always the only Asian kid in my classroom when I was in elementary school. Nobody else called their grandparents Ngin-ngin and Yeh-Yeh and nobody else's grandmother cooked pig stomach soup and sewed piecework for I.Magnin; no dolls ever looked like me and nobody had my last name.  Jim, too, was aware of being "different" and distinct in a cultural sense: His parents were sternly, devoutly, insistently, Catholic. They became "middle class almost overnight" after decades of poverty in America, and never quite adjusted. Jim's great-grandfather had drowned while digging the Panama Canal and left a young daughter and a pregnant wife who'd just immigrated from Ireland to Brooklyn; Jim's grandmother "never described her upbringing in heartwarming terms," as &lt;a href="http://www.irishecho.com/search/searchstory.cfm?id=18989&amp;amp;issueid=611"&gt;Jim recalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew Charlie was going to be "different" before he was born, and not because his parents had their own ADHD and anxiety and OCD-ness. I knew Charlie was going to be a dark-haired dark-eyed boy whose last name is Fisher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a funny kind of way, because Charlie's "different" in ways beyond anything I would have planned, I've been able to just be me, quirks and all, more than I might have if he hadn't been on the autism spectrum. Life with Charlie---a kid who struggles just to pronounce single words correctly, to remember what things are called, and to not lose it when he wants to put watermelon in his lunchbox for the next day and we don't have any---has taught me, to focus on the essentials and, also, to learn to love and accept what's there right in front of you, and to find out that you can love a lot more broadly than you had ever thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's because of Charlie's educational needs that we live in the Moms Carry A Certain Brand suburban Jersey enclave. Jim and I would be far happier in an urban setting with fewer (or no) McMansions and traffic (pedestrian and otherwise). While Charlie seems to like the deep quiet where we live, he certainly adores walking around Jersey City and Manhattan, where every corner has another storefront, another restaurant, another source of interesting delights and possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But doing what's best for your kid---that's the norm around here for sure, easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Valentine's Day yesterday---and isn't true love loving someone not for what you wish they would be, but because they're just the way they are?&lt;/p&gt;

It’s distressing because it shows that the actions of the increasingly antiscience government of Louisiana are having repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB), a scientific society with over 2000 members, &lt;a href="http://lasciencecoalition.org/2009/02/14/repercussions-in-louisiana/#more-553"&gt;has chosen to boycott Louisiana for their annual conference&lt;/a&gt; because, basically, their creationist governor and legislature want to make sure kids in their state grow up without a basic scientific education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/01/doomed_louisiana.jpg" alt="Louisiana: doomed"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="http://www.talk2action.org/story/2008/6/26/18920/8497"&gt;the Louisiana government overwhelmingly voted to allow creationist materials to be used in the classroom&lt;/a&gt;, a clear violation of the First Amendment and an incredibly foolish decision with regards to children’s education. I wrote about it quite a bit at the time (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/27/louisiana-well-thats-it-then/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is when it was signed into law, as well as &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/18/louisiana-needs-our-help-now/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/13/more-on-louisianas-doom/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/17/louisiana-even-more-doomed/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, their chickens are starting to come back to roost. At the time, Governor (and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/12/who-will-exorcise-mccains-choice-for-vp/"&gt;amateur exorcist&lt;/a&gt;) Jindal was warned that putting a jack-booted heel to the neck of science would not be without ramifications. And now the SICB won’t have their conference in New Orleans, and they have specifically cited the actions of Jindal and the Legislature as the key part of their decision. They have even gone as far as to say that the conference — with nearly 2000 attending — will be in Utah instead, where science is held in higher regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can’t have been an easy decision for the society; New Orleans is a city that needs money, and holding a fair-sized conference there would help. But I understand their decision. Jindal and the creationists in the Louisiana government are essentially holding the educations of their students hostage, so scientists and everyone in the reality-based community need to take action. It’s one thing to make your voice heard, but it’s another to speak with your wallet. Holding the conference in Louisiana would be tacitly acquiescing to the fundamentalists running the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this was the right decision, and I urge anyone who is considering running a science-based event to seriously consider states that hold science in higher regard. I hope that Louisiana teachers, parents, and students rise up and let their representatives know how they feel about science. I would hate to see the students suffer because of this, but the politicians in that state have already guaranteed that will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LA Coalition for Science &lt;a href="http://lasciencecoalition.org/docs/Release_SICB_Boycott_2.13.09.pdf"&gt;has released a statement to the press about this as well&lt;/a&gt;. It makes me physically ill that the science education of these children has been put into this position by the creationists, forcing the hand of the SICB. But the larger issue at stake here is the future of science itself in Louisiana as well as other states, a future Jindal and the other creationists are trying to choke out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234674907262"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6db393bc5f96f3a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Presidents Day</title><published>2011-02-21T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-02-21T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/holidays/presidents/presidentsday.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Whom or what does the Presidents Day holiday honor?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234674046172"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eca0521af2691e48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">A UFO Explanation</title><published>2009-02-15T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-15T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/436-a-ufo-explanation.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;

As I've said before, UFO's are real! Yes, there are Unidentified Flying Objects. They may be extraterrestrial, but before we draw that conclusion, maybe we should look at some terrestrial explanations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href="http://news.google.com/news?oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;ei=4YOXSdTaBJW6tweqtrmiCw&amp;amp;resnum=4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tab=vn&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;ncl=1303624672"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; link. 19 articles refer to the UFO in the video at the right. What could it be? News articles appeared in India, Croatia, the UK, the US, and many other places. Seems like a big deal! Could this be the smoking gun that UFO buffs have sought for years? Do we finally have proof positive that we're being visited by otherworldly creatures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this bit from the Telegraph UK article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... the unidentified black metal object stands out clearly against the blue sky, where it can be seen darting up and down for more than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Later this year, pupils from Monkseaton high school will file into their new lozenge-shaped school and take their seats before a giant video wall in a multipurpose hall. Here, they will receive a unique lesson: an intense PowerPoint presentation, repeated three times, and interspersed with 10-minute breaks of juggling or spinning plates. After one hour of this study, the pupils will be primed for one sixth of a GCSE. In theory, following this "spaced learning" method, a teenager could sit a GCSE after just three days' work.

&lt;p&gt;It is a vision of the future that may horrify many parents, teachers and the educational establishment. It challenges how we teach our children and casts doubt on GCSEs and, perhaps, the validity of our entire school system. But teachers and thinkers from around the world are making a pilgrimage to Monkseaton to investigate spaced learning, which has been devised and tested in this tatty state comprehensive over the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of careful trials yielded fascinating results: 48 year 9 pupils who had not covered any part of the GCSE science syllabus were given a complete biology module in a 90-minute spaced learning lesson. A week later, they took the relevant GCSE multiple-choice exam (a year earlier than normal). Twelve months on, the same set of pupils took another GCSE science paper after a conventional four months of study. While average scores for the second paper were higher (68% versus 58%), more than a quarter of the pupils scored higher after spaced learning than through conventional study. Despite studying for just 90 minutes with spaced learning, 80% of the class of 13- and 14-year-olds got at least a D grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;----------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monkseaton's futuristic new school opens in September. It will be where Kelley hopes to expand spaced learning, in classrooms that won't be square ("We don't have to have schools built in squares," he says) and will feature special intensive lighting to boost teenagers' concentration and wakefulness. Kelley has studied research on teenagers' circadian rhythms that shows they get going later in the day than adults - hence those epic teenage lie-ins - and hopes to start lessons at the more teen-friendly hour of 10.30am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm inclined to believe that there must be more to making memories stick than findings derived from dissecting a rat's hippocampus. Scientists would probably say that is because - despite my GCSE refresher - I don't fully understand the complex advances in neuroscience. Whatever the truth of it, something special is happening at Monkseaton. And if other teachers and academics open their minds to it, this may be just the beginning of a revolution in our classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/innovation_in_education.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Gc_YY3wGkeE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234652626270"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/arne_duncan_and_special_ed">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92d5b613c61890e3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Arne Duncan and Special Ed</title><published>2009-02-14T23:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T23:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/arne_duncan_and_special_ed" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="School supplies by Claudia Snell" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/2768163918_f9d7699341_m.jpg" height="160" alt="" width="240"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/how_much_will_your_school_district_receive_under_the_stimulus_plan"&gt;economic stimulus bill&lt;/a&gt; is to provide some &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/12/21stimdeal_web.html&amp;amp;destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/12/21stimdeal_web.html&amp;amp;levelId=2100"&gt;$100 billion for education&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, as &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/12/21stimdeal_web.html&amp;amp;destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/12/21stimdeal_web.html&amp;amp;levelId=2100"&gt;EdWeek&lt;/a&gt; notes, the bill is "[boost] funding for special education students": What might be the new administration's position on special ed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While campaigning, Obama said he'd fully fund IDEA. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is not "known for an interest in disability issues," according to special education advocates from Chicago, where Duncan was the chief executive officer of the school district for seven years. More from &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/11/21disabled.h28.html?tmp=1685053621"&gt;EdWeek&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s not been a great supporter of special ed. I don’t think he dislikes special-needs kids; it just wasn’t on his radar screen during the time he was here,” said Rodney D. Estvan, the education outreach coordinator for Access Living, a Chicago advocacy group for people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a report released in November, Access Living said the Chicago district has reported to the state that only 2 percent of students with disabilities were enrolled in a four-year college a year after graduation.&lt;br&gt;
..........&lt;br&gt;
The group also points to persistent achievement gaps for students receiving special education services. In 2008, 7 percent of 11th graders in special education met or exceeded state standards in reading, compared with 33 percent of their peers who were not receiving such services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, in 2006, Duncan proposed cutting $26.5 million from the fiscal 2007 school budget for special education. Estvan noted that, after a "'critical response'" from the disability community, some $14 million of the money was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/02/11/21disabled.h28.html?tmp=1685053621"&gt;EdWeek&lt;/a&gt; also notes two more issues highlighted by special education advocates, the question of standardized testing for special education students; discipline (a topic in need of careful discussion, in light of recent &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10-year-old_arrested"&gt;incidents&lt;/a&gt; involving children on the spectrum) and, specifically, the use of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_2_new_law_in_tennessee"&gt;restraints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/obamas-plan-to-build-a-world-free-of-unnecessary-barriers-stereotypes-and-discrimination/"&gt;plan to empower individuals with disabilities&lt;/a&gt; announced while he was campaigning, President Obama said that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;".......we must build a world free of unnecessary barriers, stereotypes, and discrimination……..policies must be developed, attitudes must be shaped, and buildings and organizations must be designed to ensure that everyone has a chance to get the education they need and live independently as full citizens in their communities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this vision be applied to students with disabilities?&lt;/p&gt;

David Chen of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/nyregion/15kirsten.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had them at “Ni hao ma.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				When Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand grabbed the microphone at the Lunar New Year parade in Chinatown two weeks ago, she blurted, “Ni hao ma, zenma yang?” in Mandarin, or “Hello, how’s it going?” Later that day, after wrapping up a meeting with local leaders at a senior center, she walked by a few card tables and said, “Hao bu hao?” or “Are you doing O.K.?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				It is customary for politicians eager to connect with ethnic voters to butcher a few words in Spanish, Chinese or other foreign tongues. But Ms. Gillibrand is no ordinary politician when it comes to linguistic and cultural comfort: as an Asian studies major at Dartmouth, she studied for six months in China and Taiwan, becoming proficient enough to absorb stories in Chinese newspapers, and later spent four months in Hong Kong as a corporate lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				Ms. Gillibrand’s Chinese is rusty now. But she tells her 5-year-old son, “man man yi diar,” or “slow down a little,” and calls chopsticks “kuaizi,” out of habit. And she can still converse for a few minutes, as evidenced when a reporter from a New York City-based Chinese-language newspaper trying to learn her Chinese name unexpectedly found an enthusiastic Ms. Gillibrand on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				“She definitely understood what I was saying, and she had good pronunciation,” said the reporter, Yan Tai, who writes for The World Journal. “Actually, I was very impressed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Gillibrand gravitated toward Chinese in college, she said, because she had never been to Asia and she loved the artistry of Chinese characters. Her Chinese name, Lu Tian Na, reflected a routine transliteration of her name. Tian Na (heaven and beautiful, respectively) represents Tina, which she was known as growing up, and the surname Lu (which means land) was thought to be a close match to her maiden name, Rutnik, and adds poetry and meaning to her Chinese name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Gillibrand has forgotten many of the 2,000 characters she once memorized. But she still comfortably wields the q’s, z’s and x’s of the Pinyin romanization system when e-mailing friends or acquaintances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;				She talked briefly in Mandarin with this reporter, too, but said that she wants to brush up, and hopes her older son, Theo, now 5, pursues Chinese in school so they can converse. But she can occasionally surprise: a few years ago, Mr. Hendon [a fellow Dartmouth student] said that he bumped into Ms. Gillibrand on the street in New York, and she greeted him with “Han Sai Si!” — his Chinese name at Dartmouth.&lt;/p&gt;

The room was packed - I got the last empty seat and there were people standing in the back. A very mixed audience, as Museum talks usually are - there were evolutionary biologists there from &lt;a href="http://www.nescent.org/index.php" title=""&gt;Nescent&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/beh_bio/" title=""&gt;W.M.Keck Center for Behavioral Biology&lt;/a&gt; at NCSU, there were Museum staff, and then there were interested lay-people, museum-goers, with no formal background in science but interested and curious. It is not easy giving a talk to such a mixed audience - how to keep the jaded Evolution-warriors interested, while not going over the heads of the non-experts, but Carl delivered masterfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After introducing briefly Darwin the person and his work, in broad brush-strokes, Carl did an interesting thing - he chose several stories and told us what Darwin thought and wrote about them, and what we now know due to recent exciting research: from evolution of whales, through human evolution, to bacteria and viruses. The result was that he did not tell but demonstrated two points: first, that Darwin was generally correct, and second, that evolutionary biology made tremendous strides over the past 150 years. With each story one was left to think - how cool Darwin would think the new findings are if he were suddenly resurrected and shown the data!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions afterwards were good - not high-tech questions one would hear at a scientific conference, but good, thoughtful questions by lay audience, the kind often heard at Science Cafes. And only one question refered to the Culture Wars - how do we deal with the existence and influence of Creationists in the USA?  If there were any Creationists in the audience, they certainly remained quiet and inconspicuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Carl and I went back to Durham and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/13/a-good-end-to-darwin-day/" title=""&gt;joined a bunch&lt;/a&gt; of local bloggers, scientists and science communicators, &lt;a href="http://deepseanews.com/" title=""&gt;Craig McClain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mistersugar.com/" title=""&gt;Anton Zuiker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fishtownuniversity.com/" title=""&gt;Russ Campbell&lt;/a&gt; among others, for some food and beer at Tyler's. Good time was had by all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you should also check Carl's latest article in TIME: &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1879213,00.html" title=""&gt;Evolving Darwin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/darwin_day_recap.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/2V_gO4Tr1IU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234646141497"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/history_of_mammoth_discoveries.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bee7a3ab33919c2c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History of Science"/><title type="html">History of Mammoth discoveries in Asia</title><published>2009-02-14T20:08:25Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T20:08:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/-gQBCis86FM/history_of_mammoth_discoveries.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/history_of_mammoth_discoveries.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;John McKay has been blogging his research on the early days of mammoth discoveries in Asia and it is an amazing read!  Who ever said that academic writing has to be dull!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/01/fragments-of-my-research-i.html" title=""&gt;Fragments of my research - I&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Studying early knowledge of mammoths presents two problems. The first, is that the people who found mammoth remains were almost never literate and the people who wrote about mammoth remains were so far removed that they almost always got their information second or third hand or worse. The second problem is that, lacking a common name for mammoth remains, it is a huge task to sort out references to mammoth ivory from similar materials used in carving. Giles Fletcher's fish tooth ivory is most likely walrus ivory. Notice how close his description is to Kashghari's and Kirakos'. Does that mean they were all describing walrus ivory? Could they have each been describing something different? And, while Fletcher's description is clearly of a walrus, can we be sure that all of the ivory he saw came from the same source? Was he throwing mammoth ivory in with walrus ivory and calling them the same thing? More research is in order.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/01/fragments-of-my-research-ii.html" title=""&gt;Fragments of my research - II&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At this point, an interesting fact to notice is that none of the Chinese sources have mentioned ivory yet. This doesn't necessarily mean that the various shu are not mammoths. Although European naturalists had enthusiastically studied the mammoth since about 1700, it wasn't until the twentieth century that they knew how the tusks were positioned. The reason for this was that they had never recovered a skull with the tusks still attached. Though generous bounties were offered for mammoth remains, the Siberian natives never reported them until after they had removed and sold the tusks. It's possible that a similar process was at work in rural China.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/01/fragments-of-my-research-iii.html" title=""&gt;Fragments of my research - III&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The generation of men who conquered Siberia were mostly illiterate and, even if they could write, they had little time for natural history, anthropology, or anything else not related to surviving, extracting wealth, and making it back alive. By the middle of the next century, a different type of person began to arrive in Siberia. Along with a more settled population came educated administrators, diplomats, and higher church authorities who had time to more closely look at the land and its treasures. At some point, they became interested in the giant bones and ivory that the natives called "mammoth."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/02/fragments-of-my-research-iv.html" title=""&gt;Fragments of my research - IV&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For centuries, if not millennia, before 1600, carvable materials had been coming out of northern Eurasia along with descriptions of large buried monsters. Of the surviving written descriptions, it's clear that many of them refer to fossil mammoth ivory and frozen mammoth carcasses, but, with many of the descriptions, it's less clear what the writers referred to. For historians and biologists, one of the biggest problems in sorting these descriptions out is, that the ancient writers used a large number of different terms and, lacking a common terminology, it's almost impossible to determine what they were referring to. In the 1690s, the word "mammoth" came out of Siberia and was adopted by the intellectual community of Western Europe. While this improved matters considerably, it also created some ambiguities of its own.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/02/fragments-of-my-research-v-nicolaas.html" title=""&gt;Fragments of my research - V&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Witsen's narrative of his journey, with the explanation of mammoths, was only a small part of his total work. Besides being buried inside a mountain of other material, the dissemination of Witsen's information on mammoths was handicapped by the book's publication history. Witsen never finished with the project. For the rest of his life, he continued to add new material. Only a few copies of each edition were printed, probably for his circle of friends. Only ten copies of his map are known to exist. Nevertheless, the Republic of Letters was a small enough community that word of his new word spread throughout Europe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/02/fragments-of-my-research-vi-in-1681.html" title=""&gt;Fragments of my research - VI&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Several things stand out in Avril's account. His translation of mammoth (or mamout or mamant) as Behemot is something that many later travelers will also do. The mention that Persians and Turks use Behemot ivory for knife handles ties into the earlier Arab sources who wrote about the substance khutu, imported from the North and used knife handles. His description of Behemot as a living animal on the shores of the Arctic ocean, suggests that he was applying the word to something other than fossil mammoth ivory. However, the mouth of the Lena River is one of the richest grounds in Siberia for collecting mammoth ivory, which suggests he was.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="recession-republicans.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/recession-republicans.gif" width="350" height="197"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At his press conference on Monday, President Barack Obama had to remind Mara Liasson of Fox News and NPR that it was the Republicans who doubled the national debt over the past eight years and it's a little strange to be hearing lectures from them now about how to be fiscally responsible. That interchange was my favorite part of the press conference. A savvy inside-the-Beltway reporter of Ms. Liasson's caliber shouldn't have to be reminded that George W. Bush and the Republican Congress were among the most fiscally reckless politicians in U.S. history.

&lt;p&gt;-----snip----------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The posturing of the Washington Republicans since Obama was elected proves correct the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard when he outlined his understanding of "simulacrum" in advanced capitalist societies where ideologies and images are copies of copies without originals. It's the kind of Reaganism mass produced on T-shirts and coffee mugs, not the real record of Reagan's actions when he was president like his "cutting and running" in Lebanon, or his raising taxes 13 times to ward off an even worse fiscal crisis, or his negotiating in an atmosphere of detente with the Soviet Union he once called an "evil empire." The Republicans today are conforming to an ideology based on a myth that other Republicans created in 1997, a copy of a copy without an original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2009 what is left of the Grand Old Party? It appears that Republican politics today have become the politics of pastiche: They love independent women like Sarah Palin and Ann Coulter yet they hate independent women like Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi; they love tax cuts and deregulation yet they also love to control women's bodies and decide who shall marry and who shall not; they love fictive workers like Joe the Plumber yet they hate real workers who want to pass the Employee Free Choice Act; and they hate the Senate filibuster until they love it to death. And while the "angry white male" is becoming the UNEMPLOYED "angry white male" the Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele says "work" does not mean "jobs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is wrong on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin. Google doesn't devalue things it touches. It increases their value by making them easier to find and access. Google increases your audience as a content creator, which is the most important asset you have. It takes a special kind of cluelessness to claim that something that increases your biggest asset "devalues" your business. Thomson's mistake seems to be that he's confusing "price" and "value" which is a bit scary for the managing editor of a business publication. Yes, the widespread availability of news may push down the price (that's just supply and demand), but it doesn't decrease the value at all. It opens up more opportunities to capture that value.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/google_devalues_everything_bwa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/2W9r_JALX6s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234646141496"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/reinventing_the_news_-_reflect.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d60a5807d6a7d01f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Reinventing the News - Reflections on innovation, by Lex Alexander</title><published>2009-02-14T19:12:22Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T19:12:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/6W3YfJxUisM/reinventing_the_news_-_reflect.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/reinventing_the_news_-_reflect.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greensboro News &amp;amp; Record was one of the first and most innovative newspapers when it comes to the use of the Web, blogs, etc. Now Les Alexander takes a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Expert-Voices/Reinventing-the-News/" title=""&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

So I was very pleased to see Glenn Greenwald dissect him in great detail in his latest post - &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2009/02/14/brooks/" title=""&gt;David Brooks reveals the mentality of the Beltway journalist&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Here we see the full expression of one of the most predominant attributes of the contemporary Beltway journalist:  because they are integral members of the Washington establishment, rather than watchdogs over it, they are incapable of finding fault with political power and they thus reflexively defend it and want it to remain unchanged.

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's amazing how explicitly Brooks here is endorsing -- and demanding -- deliberate deceit of the public.  There is, for obvious reasons, extreme anger among the American citizenry towards the piggish sleaze, systematic corruption, and wholesale destruction permeating the political establishment and our political and financial elites.  In order to pacify those sentiments, political elites tolerated, perhaps even desired, a presidential candidate with credible outsider pretenses who claimed to empathize with that popular anger and who wanted to combat the political elites who were the targets of it -- but only on the condition that he didn't really mean any of it, that it was all just a means to deceive people into believing that they still live in some sort of responsive democracy and they retain even a minimal ability to shape what the Government does.  The anti-Washington rhetoric Obama was spouting was tolerated by media elites only to the extent that none of it was sincere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this journalistic servitude to the Washington establishment most repellent is that these same pundits generally -- and David Brooks in particular -- endlessly hold themselves out as the Spokespeople of the Ordinary American, even as they work tirelessly to protect the Washington political class from their beliefs, interests and sentiments.  That's how people like David Brooks pile media deceit ("we speak for ordinary Americans") on top of political deceit (we view campaign commitments as "blather" to keep the masses satiated and quiet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant fact of American political life is that political journalists (of all people) see their role primarily as defenders of, servants to, spokespeople for the Washington establishment.  That's how they obtain all of their rewards and remain relevant.  The concept of journalists as watchdogs over political power has been turned completely on its head by power-revering servants like David Brooks, who is anything but atypical (indeed, there's a whole new generation of Beltway journalists who have learned and are eagerly replicating this model).  Brooks is about as typical and illustrative as it gets.  They benefit substantially from the prevailing rules of political power and, thus, their only concern is to preserve and strengthen it and protect it from the growing dissatisfaction and anger of the peasant class.  The more they do that, the more they are rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Scientific Society to Boycott Louisiana over LA Science Education Act&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baton Rouge, LA, February 13, 2009 — The first tangible results of the Louisiana legislature’s passage and Gov. Bobby Jindal’s signing of the 2008 Louisiana Science Education Act have materialized, and these results are negative both for the state’s economy and national reputation. The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, a national scientific society with more than 2300 members, has put Gov. Bobby Jindal on notice that the society will not hold its annual meetings in Louisiana as long as the LA Science Education Act is on the books. In a February 5, 2009, letter to the governor that is posted on the SICB website (&lt;a href="http://www.sicb.org/resources/LouisianaLetterJindal.pdf" rel="external "&gt;http://www.sicb.org/resources/Louis[…]erJindal.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) under the headline, “No Thanks, New Orleans,”  SICB Executive Committee President Richard Satterlie tells Jindal that “The SICB executive committee voted to hold its 2011 meeting in Salt Lake City because of legislation SB 561, which you signed into law in June 2008. It is the firm opinion of SICB’s leadership that this law undermines the integrity of science and science education in Louisiana.” [NOTE:  Although the legislation was introduced as SB 561, it was renumbered during the legislative process and passed as SB 733.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing out that SICB had joined with the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) in urging Jindal to veto the legislation last year, Satterlie goes on to say that “The SICB leadership could not support New Orleans as our meeting venue because of the official position of the state in weakening science education and specifically attacking evolution in science curricula.” Salt Lake City was chosen as the site of the 2011 meeting in light of the fact that “Utah, in contrast, passed a resolution that states that evolution is central to any science curriculum.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noting that SICB’s recent 2009 meeting in Boston attracted “over 1850 scientists and graduate students to the city for five days,” Satterlie pointedly tells Jindal that “As you might imagine, a professional meeting with nearly 2000 participants can contribute to the economic engine of any community.” The implication of SICB’s decision for both New Orleans, which is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina, and the entire state of Louisiana is clear. With Gov. Jindal threatening draconian budget cuts to the state’s universities, the loss of such a significant scientific convention will only add to the state’s deepening fiscal crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satterlie closes by telling Jindal that SICB will join with other groups “in suggesting [that] professional scientific societies reconsider any plans to host meetings in Louisiana.” However, SICB is not the first national scientific society to bring up the subject of boycotting Louisiana. Gregory Petsko, president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB), has already called for a boycott not only of Louisiana but of any state that passes such legislation: “As scientists, we need to join such protests with our feet and wallets. … I think we need to see to it that no future meeting of our society [after the ASBMB’s already contracted 2009 meeting in New Orleans] will take place in Louisiana as long as that law stands.” (See “It’s Alive,” ASBMB Today, August 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.asbmbtoday-digital.com/asbmbtoday/200808/" rel="external "&gt;http://www.asbmbtoday-digital.com/a[…]oday/200808/&lt;/a&gt; .)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Louisiana legislature passed the LA Science Education Act, a total of nine national scientific societies publicly called on Jindal to veto it. He ignored them, as well as everyone else who contacted him requesting that he veto the bill, choosing instead to help execute the agenda of the Louisiana Family Forum (LFF), the Religious Right organization on whose behalf Louisiana Sen. Ben Nevers introduced the bill and on whose behalf Jindal signed it. Jindal is a staunch ally of the LFF. The citizens of Louisiana, whose educational well-being the governor claims to be so concerned about, are now paying the priceÑliterallyÑfor his loyalty to his conservative Christian base.  &lt;/p&gt;

One of my favorite cities to visit is New Orleans, Louisiana. The two pleasures will not be coinciding at any time in the near future because of the ineptitude and inanity of Louisiana's legislature and governor, Bobby Jindal. Here's the press release from the &lt;a href="http://lasciencecoalition.org/"&gt;LA Science Coalition&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;National Scientific Society to Boycott Louisiana over LA Science Education Act&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first tangible results of the Louisiana legislature's passage and Gov. Bobby Jindal's signing of the 2008 Louisiana Science Education Act have materialized, and these results are negative both for the state's economy and national reputation. The Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, a national scientific society with more than 2300 members, has put Gov. Bobby Jindal on notice that the society will not hold its annual meetings in Louisiana as long as the LA Science Education Act is on the books. In a February 5, 2009,&lt;a href="http://www.sicb.org/resources/LouisianaLetterJindal.pdf"&gt;letter to the governor that is posted on the SICB website&lt;/a&gt; under the headline, "No Thanks, New Orleans," SICB Executive Committee President Richard Satterlie tells Jindal that "The SICB executive committee voted to hold its 2011 meeting in Salt Lake City because of legislation SB 561, which you signed into law in June 2008. It is the firm opinion of SICB's leadership that this law undermines the integrity of science and science education in Louisiana." [NOTE: Although the legislation was introduced as SB 561, it was renumbered during the legislative process and passed as SB 733.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pointing out that SICB had joined with the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) in urging Jindal to veto the legislation last year, Satterlie goes on to say that "The SICB leadership could not support New Orleans as our meeting venue because of the official position of the state in weakening science education and specifically attacking evolution in science curricula." Salt Lake City was chosen as the site of the 2011 meeting in light of the fact that "Utah, in contrast, passed a resolution that states that evolution is central to any science curriculum."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Noting that SICB's recent 2009 meeting in Boston attracted "over 1850 scientists and graduate students to the city for five days," Satterlie pointedly tells Jindal that "As you might imagine, a professional meeting with nearly 2000 participants can contribute to the economic engine of any community." The implication of SICB's decision for both New Orleans, which is still recovering from Hurricane Katrina, and the entire state of Louisiana is clear. With Gov. Jindal threatening draconian budget cuts to the state's universities, the loss of such a significant scientific convention will only add to the state's deepening fiscal crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Satterlie closes by telling Jindal that SICB will join with other groups "in suggesting [that] professional scientific societies reconsider any plans to host meetings in Louisiana." However, SICB is not the first national scientific society to bring up the subject of boycotting Louisiana. Gregory Petsko, president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB), has already called for a boycott not only of Louisiana but of any state that passes such legislation: "As scientists, we need to join such protests with our feet and wallets. . . . I think we need to see to it that no future meeting of our society [after the ASBMB's already contracted 2009 meeting in New Orleans] will take place in Louisiana as long as that law stands." (See&lt;a href="http://www.asbmbtoday-%20digital.com/asbmbtoday/200808/"&gt;"It's Alive,"&lt;/a&gt; ASBMB Today, August 2008.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; After the Louisiana legislature passed the LA Science Education Act, a total of nine national scientific societies publicly called on Jindal to veto it. He ignored them, as well as everyone else who contacted him requesting that he veto the bill, choosing instead to help execute the agenda of the Louisiana Family Forum (LFF), the Religious Right organization on whose behalf Louisiana Sen. Ben Nevers introduced the bill and on whose behalf Jindal signed it. Jindal is a staunch ally of the LFF. The citizens of Louisiana, whose educational well-being the governor claims to be so concerned about, are now paying the price--literally--for his loyalty to his conservative Christian base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, Louisiana. You are a lovely state, but scientists won't be supporting you as long as you're going to be dedicated to anti-scientific foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other states don&amp;#39;t have cause for complacency, though — creationism is not exclusively a Southern problem. If this keeps up, we may be having all of our scientific meetings in Canada.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/louisiana_boycotts_science_sci.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/O5xdf1rDLHg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234639511582"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1145">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a3a142345f2f7153</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><category term="Syntax"/><title type="html">V + Prt~Ø</title><published>2009-02-14T19:18:28Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T19:18:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1145" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Languagehat has &lt;a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/003405.php"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about an oddity in the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My wife was reading John McPhee's &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; article about fact checking … when she asked me what I thought about this sentence: &amp;quot;One technician who slipped up and used the &amp;#39;R&amp;#39; w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ord &lt;span&gt;[&lt;em&gt;radiation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;] was called to an office and chewed." "Chewed?" I said. "Not 'chewed out'?" She confirmed the reading. I said it must be a typo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe (ironically) "a flagrant typo in an article about fact checking", or maybe some creativity on McPhee's part, a vivid metaphor bringing the &lt;em&gt;chew&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;chew out&lt;/em&gt; back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that you can find other occurrences of &lt;em&gt;chew&lt;/em&gt; conveying something very close to &lt;em&gt;chew out &lt;/em&gt;'reprimand' (an idiom the OED describes as colloquial and chiefly U.S.). And other pairs of plain V in alternation with V plus a "particle" (Prt); the phenomenon is related to, but distinct from, the direct/oblique alternations I &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1140"&gt;posted on&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 2/15: languagehat now reports: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the excellent &lt;a href="http://polyglotveg.blogspot.com/"&gt;MMcM&lt;/a&gt; points out, the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fexec%2Fobidos%2FASIN%2F0394544277%2F&amp;amp;tag=languagehat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, Vol. 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=languagehat-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has this usage under "chew": "&lt;em&gt;v.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; Esp. &lt;em&gt;Mil.&lt;/em&gt; chew out."]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the plain &lt;em&gt;chew&lt;/em&gt; cases, starting with some that are passive (as in the McPhee sentence):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;i didnt search to see if someone asked this before, but i remember someone asking and he got chewed cus people thought he was like promoting warez and all. but do you know what you can do with these smc files? (&lt;a href="http://www.gp32x.com/board/index.php?showtopic=9762"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He got chewed in another thread about it too. Wouldnt take offense. (&lt;a href="http://www.cyclonefanatic.com/forum/47"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got chewed for not D/Cing an iv the doc said was not infusing although I had flushed it and run a drip and flushed it again without difficulty (&lt;a href="https://lists.ucdenver.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9809A&amp;amp;L=SNURSE-L&amp;amp;T=0&amp;amp;F=&amp;amp;S=&amp;amp;P=3442"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm tired and not just a little miffed over the above situation. Especially since I got chewed by my boss for taking too much time. (&lt;a href="http://forums.guildofgreeters.com/index.php?showtopic=13977&amp;amp;pid=218513&amp;amp;mode=threaded&amp;amp;start="&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a couple of active ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was driving along at a good rate and overtook a car. Didn&amp;#39;t realise it was the girlfriend&amp;#39;s old pair. They chewed me when I landed at the house that evening. &amp;quot;Do you realise the speed you were going…..dangerous…..not right in the head….. blah…..blah…..blah&amp;quot; (&lt;a href="http://www.biker.ie/forum/showpost.php?p=13239&amp;amp;postcount=32"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor chewed him Royally, for not staying on the medication, and yet the doc didn’t even ask him to have his cholesterol checked. (&lt;a href="http://healthyhinges.com/category/health-alert/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenters on languagehat's posting suggested other Prt~Ø pairs: transitive &lt;em&gt;piss&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;), in "That really pisses me off" / "That really pisses me", and intransitive &lt;em&gt;hang&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;), in "Kim and I like to hang out (with each other)" / "Kim and I like to hang (with each other)", for instance. The more recent innovations (including &lt;em&gt;chew&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt;)) are probably developing subtle meaning differences for some speakers. The pairs that have been around for a while are certainly differentiated: cf. "Strike out that last sentence" / "Strike that last sentence" and "Kim cursed him out" / "Kim cursed him", for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the P~Ø pairs, each case has its own history, its own syntactic peculiarities, its own semantic/pragmatic profile, and its own sociolinguistic profile. I haven't studied any of these cases in any detail; my only point here is to note the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to say a few words about the preposition/particle distinction, though it's one that comes up every so often here on Language Log. (I'll stick to the traditional term &lt;em&gt;preposition&lt;/em&gt; here, and to the term &lt;em&gt;particle&lt;/em&gt; as used in the 20th-century literature on English syntax, though there are good reasons for amending the terminology.) In a V+P sequence (as in "We hiked up the hill"), the combination is not a constituent; instead the P forms a constituent, a PP, with the following NP, as shown by various tests: for instance, the PP can be fronted as a unit, as in "Up the hill we hiked". In a V+Prt sequence (as in "We looked up Kim's address"), the combination is a constituent, a kind of two-part verb that exhibits some special syntax not available for V+P sequences: in particular, the two parts can stay together or they can "wrap around" a direct object (as in "We looked Kim's address up"; cf. *"We hiked the hill up").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more, but this should serve to give some sense of the distinction. V+P and V+Prt are easily confounded, because of the tight semantic relationship between the two parts in many cases, but syntactically they are very different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234638854714"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1412">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f1fc043f138ae55</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Counseling"/><category term="Deaf / hard of hearing"/><category term="Family"/><category term="Love &amp; acceptance"/><category term="advocacy"/><category term="attribution errors"/><category term="invisible disabilities"/><category term="personal change"/><title type="html">For the first time in 28 years</title><published>2009-02-14T19:07:09Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T19:07:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/for-the-first-time-in-28-years/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">I have not bought a Valentine’s present for my husband.

If one of the females pops out a brood of pups, you're in trouble. You can either try to weedle a bigger allowance out of your parents, try to give gerbils away, starve the gerbils... or start killing gerbil pups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, at more than six billion &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; in our worldwide gerbil cage, we've pretty much got the same choices, only we can't give people away -- but we can control the number of pups born. And we need to. Because within the next century, our global population is going to come down one way or the other. Famine, war, pandemics -- or contraception. Those are our choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing is to make sure that next generation is smaller than the current one, and continue that way for centuries until we reach a sustainable level again. Chinese dictatorial population practices have been highly successful in this regard: on one hand, the one-child-per-couple policy (ethically defensible in my opinion), on the other the underground tendency for selective abortion of girls (ethically iffy but unintentionally very effective in curtailing population growth). We need to do even better by democratic means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woman or man -- thy loins must never issue more than two children, preferably less! That's the &lt;i&gt;replacement rate&lt;/i&gt;. But by all means have a whole gerbil-like clutch of children, a full quiver, a soccer team -- through adoption. Empty the world's orphanages! And regardless of whether you decide to have kids at all -- put money into the education of girls. Because one of the surest ways known to sociology of keeping nativity figures down is to give girls an education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting children into the world comes with a certain responsibility. They're not going to thank you for putting them on the planet if in 30 years their kids are dying of dysentery and malnourishment in a refugee camp. Let's try to ease population down, and maybe we can avoid a crash.&lt;/p&gt;

These "gloom and doom" statements always strike me with profound irony, a tinge of offense, and a minor fit of the giggles, particularly when they come from doctors who have met one-on-one with my intimate partner: my partner and I are currently in our 16th year as, well, intimate partners is exactly what we are.  The idea that people on the spectrum can't form intimate bonds, can't fall in love, and can't form lasting relationships is a "fact" that exists more in the brains of certain medical professionals than in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in time for Valentine's Day, Glamour Magazine (oh yes, a girlie rag!), published a sweet four page story &lt;a href="http://www.glamour.com/magazine/2009/02/theyre-autistic-and-theyre-in-love?currentPage=4"&gt;They're Autistic--and They're in Love&lt;/a&gt;.  The story is about a couple Lindsy and Dave, both diagnosed autistic, who found each other, fell in love, and moved in together, each taking care to do what they need to make the relationship work, even if that means doing things a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Lindsy and Dave, my relationship with my partner doesn't look exactly like the typical marriage from the outside.  We met unconventionally.  I've never been on a date and can't imagine what I'd do with one (from what I've seen and read they appear really boring--though some of you on the spectrum may be interested in dating guides by and for us like &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wFHwokAKsFoC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=jody+ramey&amp;amp;ei=uNKVSdr5MKWQkASIue3lCQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Autistic's Guide to Dating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Emilia Murry Ramey, Jody John Ramey).  My partner and I have a quirky little life.  We often enjoy each other's company in parallel, make lots of space for decompression, communicate in our own way, and have learned how to strategize comfortably around such daily horrors as The Crunching of the Potato Chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also like Lindsy and Dave, on the inside, where it matters, my partner and I are just as in love as anyone who is in love.  Just because something looks a little different on the outside doesn't mean it isn't valid from within.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234632437715"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=290">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/65f0791323e655c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Derek Draper repeats some canards of the alternative health industry on nutrition</title><published>2009-02-14T16:00:10Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T16:00:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/derek-draper-repeats-some-canards-of-the-alternative-health-industry-on-nutrition/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Derek Draper, as well as having an unreliable CV, has appeared on ITV1’s Kyle’s Academy through his DIY-Therapy website - described as “The one-stop-shop for information and tools to improve your emotional wellbeing.”.  Jon from the magnificent and recently redesigned Holfordwatch has alerted me to a document published by DIY-Therapy ‘The Good Mood Diet‘ which [...]&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gimpyblog.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=1769773&amp;amp;post=290&amp;amp;subd=gimpyblog&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;</summary><author><name>gimpy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234632437715"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/ceci_nest_pas_la_costa_brava_f.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd9327f4af0997e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">‘Ceci n’est pas la Costa Brava’: fake photo story gets weird</title><published>2009-02-14T12:14:47Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T12:14:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/ceci_nest_pas_la_costa_brava_f.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week the Guardian ran &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/feb/11/costa-brava-advert-bahamas"&gt;an amusing story&lt;/a&gt; of photo-fakery by enthusiastic Spanish tourism board employees: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spain's Costa Brava uses Bahamas photograph in ad campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tourist board denies being deceitful by using picture from tropical islands to advertise beaches in north-eastern Spain&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quite predictably, it turns out that sometimes the pictures in holiday adverts aren't actually representational of the destination. Who knew? The photo of an idyllic deserted beach used in a campaign for the Costa Brava was actually taken in the Bahamas. For extra chuckles, the Guardian highlighted the unintentionally ironic slogan used in the campaign: "Where does the Costa Brava start?".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the photo used in the Costa Brava Girona tourism board's campaign, alongside the Guardian's photo of the Costa Brava, as used to illustrate the story on the Guardian website:&lt;br&gt;

This is my favourite bit of any newspaper, because it offers a tiny window into the busy newsroom, shining light on the untold stories - who didn't check their references, which stories were too good to let the facts get in the way, and so forth. Today's was especially brilliant:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="costa2.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/costa2.jpg" width="250" height="200"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Quote: A photo used to show "the real Costa Brava" was taken in Calella, which is often described as part of the Costa Brava but is in fact on the adjoining Costa Maresme&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So does anyone actually have a picture of the Costa Brava? Does it even exist? Perhaps, like the case of &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/news/article5704911.ece"&gt;Samantha Lazzaris&lt;/a&gt; last week, holiday operators simply send customers asking for one destination to anywhere resembling the photo on the brochure, knowing full well that British people won't care where they are so long as there's a ready supply of sun, sea, cheap beer and English newspapers. Given our reputation as a nation of monolinguals, we probably wouldn't even notice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/ceci_nest_pas_la_costa_brava_f.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234632437715"><id gr:original-id="http://dcscience.net/?p=1119">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e50d68b441f933b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Captain Cook applies for a grant</title><published>2009-02-14T08:56:42Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T08:56:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dcscience.net/?p=1119" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">This classic was published in issue 1692 of New Scientist magazine, 25 November  1989.  Frank Watt was head of the Scanning Proton Microprobe Unit in the Department of Physics at Oxford University.

He and I have been interviewed together on a very popular and respectable Christian program called &lt;a href="http://www.thethingsthatmattermost.org/about.htm"&gt;The Things That Matter Most&lt;/a&gt; (publication date March 1st). For a Christian program that's supposed to be fair with both sides, it wasn't. You'll be able to see for yourselves when they post it.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For now let me offer a critique of Pastor Dave Schmelzer's &lt;em&gt;Four Stage&lt;/em&gt; faith typology, which can be read in detail &lt;a href="http://notreligious.typepad.com/notreligious/stage-4-faith.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to fully understand my critique you need to read what he wrote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My critique:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is all rhetoric and completely irrelevant to the truth claims of Christianity in any meaningful sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dave improperly inserts atheism into a rebellious questioning third stage. But there are children who are brought up in good homes without any religious faith at all. Surely someone cannot say these children have been living all of their lives in the third rebellious stage. They were merely raised as non-believers. Only if they question their own atheism could someone say they are in stage three. So to be consistent, the third rebellious stage for the Christian would more properly describe backsliding or questioning Christians, since this is a spiritual four stage process, not a non-spiritual one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottom line is that I could just as easily take these four stages of spiritual growth and apply them to Mormons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stage 1: criminal Mormons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stage 2: rules-based Mormons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stage 3: rebellious Mormons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stage 4: mystical Mormons&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this has nothing to do with the truth claims of Mormonism or of Christianity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole reason Dave argues this way is because he claims to have a relationship with an imaginary being. To me that’s representative of young children who play pretend games, not adult thinking, anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read our further exchange on the value of religious experience &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/01/testing-religious-experience-by.html?showComment=1234306080000#c8839766298187068723"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;, leaving him with no reason to believe at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Edited for additional comment below]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the four stage process Peck proposes simply represents a four stage personal maturity process. We never ever completely leave any of the earlier stages--sometimes they are necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can apply this maturity process to spirituality if you want to, or skepticism, or knowledge in general, &lt;strong&gt;so long as you keep the focus the same&lt;/strong&gt;. I could just as easily say that all Christians are in stage 3 from a non-spiritual focus, for I think they are rebelling against the evidence, you see, and I do! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know of skeptics who think Christians are stupid. I don't consider that a mature stage 4 understanding of the issues that separate us at all, although, I grant that some believers are stupid, as are some skeptics. There are people who think they have all the answers on both sides of this debate, and it is a debate! It's a debate about what to believe. It's a debate about what rules we should live by. And I have every right to rebel against the rules Christians set up, just as Christians might rebel against the rules I might set up. In fact, if atheism were the dominant view in society I could claim that Christians are stuck in stage 3! So you cannot circumvent this whole debate by punting to stage 4 faith. The debate remains regardless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's be done then with this as a focus for describing anything about the content of what a person believes or knows. It doesn't at all. It merely describes the stages that mature adults go through. Some adults never move on to a more mature understanding, I know. But one can have a mature understanding of Islam or Mormonism or atheism too. That's why I describe myself as an "agnostic atheist." I'm not sure there isn't a God but I don't think so. Now that's a true stage 4 if there ever was one! Which Christian here would say the same thing? Which one would say "I think there is a God but I'm not sure"?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sahilonline.org/news/imp_files/pramod_mutalik.jpg" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s up with scowly guy?  His name is Pramod Mutalik and he’s the chief of a right-wing Hindu group called Sri Ram Sene (Lord Ram’s Army).  The group believes that Valentine’s Day is ‘un-Indian.’ They are threatening to &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/4447238/Hindu-extremists-will-attack-Valentines-Day-couples.html"&gt;attack any Indian couples celebrating Valentine’s Day&lt;/a&gt;.  That’s right, if you celebrate a holiday that is about love and intimacy, they want to beat the snot out of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group members consider themselves the caretakers of Indian culture, which of course means their own, very specific definition of what Indian culture is. They want to get back down to good old-fashioned Hindu values, by threatening to attack or &lt;a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/well-upload-pics-of-obscene-couples-ram-s.../423170/"&gt;expose couples showing affection in public&lt;/a&gt;. In Pramod’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valentine’s Day is definitely not Indian culture. We will not allow celebration of that day in any form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an old softy.  He’s not kidding. Last week, members of the Sri Ram Sene &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/world/asia/09india.html?ref=world"&gt;launched an attack&lt;/a&gt; on a bar in Mangalore, in India.  Women were attacked for being in the bar, men were attacked for taking women to the bar.  Parts of the incident were captured and are on &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SSl2SOT57o"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! There’s more to the story. And it involves pink underwear.  Read more beyond the foldThere are those who agree with the SRS, but there has also been a huge amount of outrage expressed in India over the attack. Lord Ram’s Army remains unabashed.  They believe that they are in a cultural war for the identify of the country and that their tactics are fully justified. From SRS general secretary V.K. Rajesh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are not against love. But we are against loose morals we see among the younger generation who are blindly aping the West. And we will not spare these people and we will take whatever action is needed within the law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell V.K. that assault is not technically within the law. Several of the attackers were arrested but released on bail a week or so later. They continued to make threats against couples seen celebrating Valentine’s Day, including threatening to force couples to marry (it’s unclear how they were going to accomplish this. One can only assume they had a fleet of ugly bridesmaid’s dresses, drunk uncles and 80’s music on standby).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the authorities aren’t taking any chances on that either.  Yesterday, police &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gTZXFEHmRT4tpSftD2bzDZxcn0Sw"&gt;rounded up almost 100 of the activists&lt;/a&gt; and took them into custody as a preventative measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detentions follow calls by federal Home Minister Palaniappan Chidamabaram urging Karnataka’s Hindu nationalist administration to take “preventive and punitive” action to ensure law and order in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess they’re within the law now, literally.  But there’s more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite part of the story is how a group of Indian women is responding to the SRS with a very traditional Indian approach. Gandhi first introduced the concept of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyagraha"&gt;Satyagraha&lt;/a&gt; or nonviolent resistance during the British occupation of India. Gandhi broke British laws by hand-spinning his own cloth and walking to the sea to make salt.  The &lt;a href="http://www.thepinkchaddicampaign.blogspot.com/"&gt;Consortium of Pubgoing, Loose and Forward Women&lt;/a&gt; is sending Pramod Mutalik pink underwear. In large quantities. Called the Pink Chaddi campaign, they are asking their supporters to send them pink chaddis (Hindi slang for knickers) which they will then forward en masse to SRS. After all, all armies need the basic necessities, right? The group is also encouraging women to go to pubs on Valentine’s Day. Founder Nisha Susan says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have signed up to drop chaddis at collection points in their cities, which will be sent to Bangalore. Those who have signed up also plan to go to pubs with their partners or friends on V-Day. Most of the members don’t drink and some haven’t ever visited a pub, but the spirit is to band together against moral policing and curbs on women’s freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.  So, no matter how you feel about Valentine’s Day, I encourage you to join the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=49641698651"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; group and send some knickers to Pramod.  Or a Valentine’s Day card or a box of chocolate. Or even better, go to a bar and raise a toast to the Pink Chaddis. Best. Protest. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234624971870"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-4151404303779434542">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1bd3e28b8f28833e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellaneous" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Darwin" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Happy birthday wishes to Darwin.</title><published>2009-02-14T13:04:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T13:05:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/sOFAzBPxMFM/happy-birthday-wishes-to-darwin.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=4151404303779434542" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/happy-birthday-wishes-to-darwin.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Posted a little late, but fun...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/jn7zLGJE9EY%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/sOFAzBPxMFM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234622169988"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_wit_and_wisdom_of_gkar.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/342a2edfc6f2731f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><title type="html">The wit and wisdom of G'Kar</title><published>2009-02-14T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/5s_j2yVeoDM/the_wit_and_wisdom_of_gkar.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_wit_and_wisdom_of_gkar.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Classic Insolence logo" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2006/08/ClassicInsolence.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, as we have been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/an_open_letter_to_seth_aronson_about_his.php"&gt;dreading&lt;/a&gt; for the last four months or so since her relapse was diagnosed, my mother-in-law passed away from breast cancer in hospice. She died peacefully, with my wife and the rest of her family at her side. As you might expect, I do not much feel like blogging. Because I foresaw this day coming, however, I did set up a series of reposts to autopost for you while I am in mourning. Some, I have even updated and spiffed up. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks. Since it's been three years since Andreas Katsulas died of lung cancer, I thought I'd repost this; somehow I find that these quotes lift my spirits somewhat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since the death of Andreas Katsulas, I've been thinking just how many great lines he had as G'Kar in the series and how well he delivered them. Here, culled from the web, is but a sampling of some of them. Some are very serious; some are humorous, but all are quintessential G'Kar. I can't think of a better tribute:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_wit_and_wisdom_of_gkar.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_wit_and_wisdom_of_gkar.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/5s_j2yVeoDM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234620606238"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1144">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb9a58b8a82d5a93</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language planning"/><category term="Punctuation"/><title type="html">After the apostrophe goes, what next?</title><published>2009-02-14T14:07:56Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T14:07:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1144" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As Arnold Zwicky has reported &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1090"&gt;(here)&lt;/a&gt; the movement to get rid of possessive apostrophes has reached a crescendo among place-name language planners like the Birmingham city council, who have stopped using them on street signs. Feeding the fire a bit, Michael Quinion’s World Wide Words, also cited by Arnold &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1116"&gt;(here)&lt;/a&gt;, then reported how other language planners, including the US Board on Geographic Names and the Committee for Geographic Names in Australia, are also making the world safe from possessive apostrophes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These actions leave many wondering whether this forebodes an impending egalitarian march against not only the possessive apostrophe, but also against other possessive indicators and perhaps even against the human frailty of unbridled possessiveness.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this may be exactly what will happen. Unconfirmed rumors have it that after the possessive apostrophe is finally eliminated, the first person possessive pronouns, &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt; will next come under the attack of language planners.  Although the leaders of a grass roots organization called World Egalitarian Language Planners (WELP) have not yet unveiled how they plan to get rid of those nasty little self-centered possessive pronouns, close sources who are as yet unwilling to be identified say that one likely solution is to replace the possessive pronouns &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt; with second person pronouns prefixed with &lt;em&gt;un-&lt;/em&gt; , yielding utterances such as, “I’d like to express unyour opinion on the matter” and “Other members of unyour  squad would like to know who will play first base on unyour softball team next season.”  Song lyrics will need to be changed, of course. High on the candidate list will be, “I find a broken heart among unyour souvenirs” and “I want to make you unyours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then what? After first person pronouns have been completely abolished, WELP’s next obvious task will be to remove all second and third person possessive pronouns as well, based on their philosophy that possession has no place in the increased enlightenment of a totally egalitarian state. This would leave us with sentences like: “I’d like to express opinion on the matter,” “I find a broken heart among souvenirs,” and the perhaps more troublesome, “I want to make you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this final language planning phase begins, the &lt;em&gt;un-&lt;/em&gt; marker will be removed, and first person pronoun possession, like apostrophes on street signs and place names, will be stamped out forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear what the future holds for second and third person possessive pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234619596985"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/mricon-mhmm/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2805c582397e973f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">@mricon mhmm</title><published>2009-02-14T13:17:52Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T13:17:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/mricon-mhmm/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;@mricon mhmm&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234616408483"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-1149938583946727330">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5699e630bec060b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">President Obama discussing science.</title><published>2009-02-14T12:34:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T12:44:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/tfSIrHXDROY/president-obama-discussing-science.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=1149938583946727330" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/president-obama-discussing-science.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Just want to thank you again, my American neighbours, for (ahem, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt;) electing an intellectual leader -- this hardly makes up for the past 8 years, but it is a fantastic start.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/kFsB1Jk1OQ0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you listening, Mr. Harper?&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/tfSIrHXDROY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234612266088"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1142">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12878cb10880d68a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">Resilience</title><published>2009-02-14T11:12:42Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T11:12:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1142" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1132"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; is not the only secular democracy where freedom of speech is now under attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johann Hari's essay, "&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-why-should-i-respect-these-oppressive-religions-1517789.html"&gt;Why should I respect these oppressive religions?&lt;/a&gt;", originally published in The Independent on 1/28/2009, was republished on 2/5/2009 by The Statesman, a leading English-language periodical based in in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to several days of protests, eventually violent, by Muslims who felt that the essay insulted their religion; and on Wednesday, 2/11/2009, Ravindra Kumar and Anand Sinha, the editor and publisher of The Statesman, were arrested and charged under section 295A of the Indian Penal Code which forbids "deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings". (See Jerome Taylor, "&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/editor-arrested-for-outraging-muslims-1607256.html"&gt;Editor arrested for 'outraging Muslims'&lt;/a&gt;", The Independent, 2/12/2009.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hari has responded with another essay, "&lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-despite-these-riots-i-stand-by-what-i-wrote-1608059.html"&gt;Despite these riots, I stand by what I wrote: The answer to the problems of free speech is always more free speech&lt;/a&gt;", 2/13/2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The protestors said I deliberately set out to "offend" them, and I am supposed to say that, no, no offence was intended. But the honest truth is more complicated. Offending fundamentalists isn't my goal – but if it is an inevitable side-effect of defending human rights, so be it. If fanatics who believe Muslim women should be imprisoned in their homes and gay people should be killed are insulted by my arguments, I don't resile from it. Nothing worth saying is inoffensive to everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;You do not have a right to be ring-fenced from offence. Every day, I am offended – not least by ancient religious texts filled with hate-speech. But I am glad, because I know that the price of taking offence is that I can give it too, if that is where the facts lead me. But again, the protestors propose a lop-sided world. They do not propose to stop voicing their own heinously offensive views about women's rights or homosexuality, but we have to shut up and take it – or we are the ones being "insulting". &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned a new word from this: &lt;em&gt;resile&lt;/em&gt;, "To draw back from an agreement, contract, statement". The OED says that this is "chiefly in Scottish use", which would explain why I haven't noticed it before. In fact, though Hari's original essay didn't use the word, its theme was that the United Nations has resiled from its Universal Declaration of Human Rights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The right to criticise religion is being slowly doused in acid. Across the world, the small, incremental gains made by secularism – giving us the space to doubt and question and make up our own minds – are being beaten back by belligerent demands that we "respect" religion. A historic marker has just been passed, showing how far we have been shoved. The UN rapporteur who is supposed to be the global guardian of free speech has had his job rewritten – to put him on the side of the religious censors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The Universal Declaration of Human Rights stated 60 years ago that "a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief is the highest aspiration of the common people". It was a Magna Carta for mankind – and loathed by every human rights abuser on earth. Today, the Chinese dictatorship calls it "Western", Robert Mugabe calls it "colonialist", and Dick Cheney calls it "outdated". The countries of the world have chronically failed to meet it – but the document has been held up by the United Nations as the ultimate standard against which to check ourselves. Until now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Starting in 1999, a coalition of Islamist tyrants, led by Saudi Arabia, demanded the rules be rewritten. The demand for everyone to be able to think and speak freely failed to "respect" the "unique sensitivities" of the religious, they decided – so they issued an alternative Islamic Declaration of Human Rights. It insisted that you can only speak within "the limits set by the shariah [law]. It is not permitted to spread falsehood or disseminate that which involves encouraging abomination or forsaking the Islamic community".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In other words, you can say anything you like, as long as it precisely what the reactionary mullahs tell you to say. The declaration makes it clear there is no equality for women, gays, non-Muslims, or apostates. It has been backed by the Vatican and a bevy of Christian fundamentalists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Incredibly, they are succeeding. The UN's Rapporteur on Human Rights has always been tasked with exposing and shaming those who prevent free speech – including the religious. But the Pakistani delegate recently demanded that his job description be changed so he can seek out and condemn "abuses of free expression" including "defamation of religions and prophets". The council agreed – so the job has been turned on its head. Instead of condemning the people who wanted to murder Salman Rushdie, they will be condemning Salman Rushdie himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Anything which can be deemed "religious" is no longer allowed to be a subject of discussion at the UN – and almost everything is deemed religious. Roy Brown of the International Humanist and Ethical Union has tried to raise topics like the stoning of women accused of adultery or child marriage. The Egyptian delegate stood up to announce discussion of shariah "will not happen" and "Islam will not be crucified in this council" – and Brown was ordered to be silent. Of course, the first victims of locking down free speech about Islam with the imprimatur of the UN are ordinary Muslims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to the BBC, the editor in question is himself actively resiling (Subir Bhaumik, "&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7883612.stm"&gt;Pair held for 'offending Islam'&lt;/a&gt;", 2/12/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mr Kumar has said he has already issued a public apology for reproducing the article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"Not anticipating the reaction to the story was an error of judgement and we have regretted that, " Mr Kumar told the BBC in an interview.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Mohit Joshi's &lt;a href="http://www.topnews.in/statesmans-editor-publisher-arrested-hurting-muslim-feelings-out-bail-2123812"&gt;ANI article&lt;/a&gt; suggests a more nuanced resilience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;On two separate occasions, Kumar issued statements standing by his decision to publish the article. But he also said he had not meant to cause offence to any religion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href="http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=1&amp;amp;id=276354&amp;amp;usrsess=1"&gt;brief description&lt;/a&gt; of the arrest in The Statesman gives the impression of an event staged to some extent as political theater to defuse the protests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Upon learning that a case had been registered by Kolkata Police, The Statesman contacted senior officers and offered to assist its investigation, and to aid efforts to defuse tensions in the city. Following this, the arrests were made early today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The city has been rocked by protests and violence since 7 February. The protesters had demanded the immediate arrest of the Editor. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: It's worth noting that West Bengal, the Indian state where Kolkata is located, is governed by the Left Front Alliance, a parliamentary coalition headed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The Left Front Alliance has been in power for some 30 years, making West Bengal what the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal#Government_and_politics"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; calls "the world's longest-running democratically-elected communist government". I gather that the CPI(M) also dominates Kolkata city politics.  Presumably the CPI(M) is ideologically comfortable with secularism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another relevant piece of background is the case of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taslima_Nasreen#Expulsion_from_Calcutta"&gt;Taslima Nasreen&lt;/a&gt;, a Bangladeshi author who fled Bangladesh after being accused of blasphemy, and was forced to leave Kolkata last year after violent riots protesting her presence.  Her offenses include secularism as well as feminism.  It's not clear to me how extensive an overlap there is between the groups protesting Nasreen and Hari, and the political constituency of the CPI(M). ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other &lt;a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Kolkata_/City_gets_ready_for_V-Day_show_of_defiance/articleshow/4127248.cms"&gt;news from Kolkata&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A group of men and women "from all walks of life" will raise a toast to the spirit of love across city pubs, in a show of defiance to the right-wing threats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Displaying solidarity with the pink chaddi movement flagged off by the Consortium of Pub-going, Loose and Forward Women to counter the Sene dictum, the group could be joined by city intellectuals. Starting off at the Gossip bar in south Kolkata, the group plans to move to other joints in the city, in an open challenge to "conservative tyrants who plan to curb the freedom to love and live".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;For two hours from 1 pm on Saturday, the group will celebrate the spirit of freedom by downing a few pegs. "Citizens concerned about the shrinking space for women's rights" have been invited to join. "It is time all right-thinking people came together and protest. If we don't act now, the right to freedom of expression will be lost forever," said a spokesperson for the group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background is a threat from the Hindu  group &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Ram_Sena"&gt;Sri Ram Sene&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.india.com/news/india/ram_sena_chief_bailed_and_arrested_again_2796"&gt;disrupt Valentine's Day activities&lt;/a&gt;.  Members of the group have been arrested for assaulting pub-goers; but ironically, the basis for taking  &lt;a href="http://www.hindu.com/2009/02/14/stories/2009021457620100.htm"&gt;Pramod Muthalik and 356 other Ram Sene activists into custody&lt;/a&gt; seems to be, at least in part, the "&lt;a href="http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200901290324.htm"&gt;distribution of pamphlets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="margin-left:2pt"&gt;that allegedly had contents to disturb communal harmony."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, communal harmony is apparently &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g5YhZtvKPMPi4-EHjH7M6_VDUG8gD96A628G1"&gt;safe from Valentine's Day threats&lt;/a&gt; in Saudi Arabia, where all red-colored objects are said to be banned from store shelves during the weeks before Feb. 14, thus elevating the suppression of expression to new levels of symbolic abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Lee County Sheriff's Office incident report, the confrontation escalated over a pair of scissors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teacher Terri Plazewski told deputies she saw 10-year-old Ian cutting his shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She told deputies another teacher told Ian to stop, but he threw the scissors, ran out of the room and locked himself in the principal's office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School employees and the principal went into the office and Ian hit Plazewski in the upper chest and kicked her in the groin, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deputy said he witnessed Ian throw himself onto the floor and bang his head on the ground, "while in a crying and frantic tantrum."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian was arrested and taken to the Juvenile Assessment Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Ian's mother,Heather] Hawk says Ian has tantrums all the time, but this time he got arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't believe a child with autism who can't understand what's going on is being arrested," said Hawk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian has been suspended for four days and will go to court where he will "face one count of battery on a public or private education employee."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, everyone is concerned for everyone's safety, for Ian and for the teachers and staff at his school. Given his diagnosis and (according to Hawk) a history of tantrums, it seems that some kind of behavior plan could or should have been in place, as well as teaching protocols so Ian could learn other ways to communicate frustration or anxiety or whatever leads to him tantrumming. But why is the law being called in, and why was a child---a disabled child---&lt;em&gt;arrested&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Maryland and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have mapped the genome of the common cold virus. This doesn’t mean that a cure is just around the corner, but it gives scientists a clearer idea of how to begin planning a cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the story at &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090212141149.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/02/this-drink-tastes-like-piss.html"&gt;This Drink Tastes Like Piss &lt;/a&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mNHAJ04OdjM/SZWhbdCxM_I/AAAAAAAAAbE/hj0QemX28lg/s1600-h/urinetherapy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:left;width:150px;height:200px;margin:0 10px 10px 0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mNHAJ04OdjM/SZWhbdCxM_I/AAAAAAAAAbE/hj0QemX28lg/s200/urinetherapy.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;India’s largest Hindu nationalist group, the RSS, is developing a new beverage made mostly from cow urine that they hope will take their country by storm. They see the popularity of non-Indian soft drinks like Coca-Cola as a corrupting force in Indian culture, so they want to bring people back to the kind of hard-line Hindu cow reverence that would inspire people to consume bovine waste as a cleansing agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my choice is between Mountain Dew or cow piss? Ewww. I’ll take the cow piss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classic was published in issue 1692 of &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt;, 25 November  1989.  Frank Watt was head of the Scanning Proton Microprobe Unit in the Department of Physics at Oxford University.  He wrote for the New Scientist an article on &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13017713.200-microscopes-with-proton-power-physicists-are-developing-away-of-using-atomic-nuclei-to-seek-out-and-map-minute-amounts-of-elementsinsamples-without-destroying-them-.html?DCMP=ILC-arttsrhcol&amp;amp;nsref=specrt13_bar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microscopes with proton power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the light of yesterday’s fuss about research funding, &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=405335"&gt;Modest revolt to save research from red tape &lt;/a&gt;, this seemed like a good time to revive Watt’s article.  It was written near to the end of the reign of Margaret Thatcher, about a year before she was deposed by her own party. It shows how little has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now the fashion for grant awarding agencies to ask what percentage of  your time will be spent on the project.  I recently reviewed a grant in which the applicants had specified this to four significant figures, They’d&lt;br&gt;
  pretended they knew, a year before starting the work that they could say how  much time they’d spend with an accuracy better  than three hours.  Stupid questions evoke stupid answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article gave rise to some political follow-up in &lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13017714.300--thistle-diary-missing-the-interdisciplinary-point--comment-from-westminster--.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13518325.800-letters-second-leg-needed-.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WELL, that’s it,’ thought the Captain. ‘We have the best ship in the world, the most experienced crew, and navigators par excellence. All we need now is a couple of tons of ship’s biscuits and it’s off to the ends of the world.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total cost: Pounds sterling 21 7s 7d (adjusted for inflation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September 1762: Application MOD2279 rejected by the Castle and Moats subcommittee&lt;br&gt;
of the NRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) Why discover a large continent when there are hundreds of castles in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) It is highly unlikely that Cook’s ship will fit into the average moat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Damn,’ thought the Captain, ’shiver me timbers, the application has gone to the wrong committee.’ ‘Come back in six months,’ he told his sturdy crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear NRC, Why did our application MOD2279 go to the Castle and Moats subcommittee instead of the Tall Ships committee? Yours sincerely, James Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Cock, The Tall Ships subcommittee has been rationalised, and has been replaced by the Castle and Moats subcommittee and the Law and Order subcommittee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely, NRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Damn,’ thought the Captain, ‘rummage me topsail, we’ll never get off the ground like this. I had better read up on this new chaos theory.’ In fact the Captain did not do this, but instead took advice from an old sea dog who had just been awarded a grant of Pounds sterling 2 million from the emergency drawbridge fund to research the theory of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NRC Application no MOD2391, January 1763 (to be considered by the Law and Order subcommittee). Applicant J. Cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aim: Feasibility study for the transportation of rascals, rogues and vagabonds to a remote continent on the other side of the world. Initial pilot studies involve a three-year return journey to a yet undiscovered land mass called Australia .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements: Supplies for a three-year voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total cost: Pounds sterling 21 7s 8d (again adjusted for inflation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Coko, We are pleased to inform you that your application MOD2391 has been successful. Unfortunately, due to the financial crisis at the moment, the subcommittee has recommended that funding for your three-year round trip to Australia be cut to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely, NRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A letter to Mr Darwin&lt;/strong&gt; A correspondent draws my attention  to another lovely piece from the EMBO Reports Journal )Vol 10, 2009), by Frank Gannon. [&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/A_letter_to_Darwin.pdf"&gt;Download the pdf.&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr Darwin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;” .  .  .  .  In a further comment, referee three decries your descriptive approach, which leaves the task of explaining the ‘how’ to others. His/her view is that any publications resulting from your work will inevitably be acceptable only to lowimpact specialist journals; even worse, they might be publishable only as a monograph. As our agency is judged by the quality of the work that we support—measured by the average impact factor of the papers that result from our funding—this is a strongly negative comment”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather sadly, this excellent editorial had to accompanied by a pusillanimous disclaimer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/luskin_flaunts_his_persecution.php"&gt;PZ Myers comments&lt;/a&gt; on Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute’s latest 6800-word opinion piece in the U.S. News and World Report, where Casey complains about how the big bad scientists are making fun of him and silencing his ideas. In the process, Myers observes that after complaining that science is silencing his views, Luskin takes full advantage of the 6800 words he was given in the U.S. News and World Report to bitch and complain while never using the platform to present any of this AMAZING “evidence” for “Intelligent” Design. Nothing. I think maybe Luskin should ask himself whether it’s science that’s keeping his ideas from the public or if it’s just him. . .or that perhaps the extent of his ideas is simply bitching and complaining about not having a voice when he really has nothing to say.&lt;/p&gt;

What can I say? It’s just a great example of a picture equalling a thousand words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t care what your opinion of animal rights or vegetarianism, or whatever is. We should all be able to come together and ridicule these assclowns who thought there’s no such thing as bad publicity and actually thought dressing up like Ku Klux Klan members to draw attention to themselves by making non-existent comparisons between the KKK and animal breeding was a good idea. Though apparently by just saying it is an apt comparison, PETA spokesmen Michael McGraw thought he could magically change history. He apparently forgot that he needed 21.1 gigawatts and a vehicle moving at 88 miles an hour to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also slightly hits me on a personal level since my half uncle used to breed dogs. He also defended Michael McGraw’s family’s asses during World War II, which I’m sure is more than Michael McGraw has ever done. You’re telling me he’s no different than the Klan? GO FUCK YOURSELF, you over-privileged white asshole! Or even better. Pick up a history book some time and read it. . .then lynch yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m not that into the whole animal rights thing and I’m a proud omnivore, I at least have respect for the majority of the animal rights/vegetarian/vegan/etc. movement, while in the name of animal rights, PETA repeatedly sets back this movement by making everyone else in the movement seem fanatical by association. And if you were to ask anyone on the street to name an animal rights group, I’d bet money that 100% of the time people would name PETA and when asked to name another, they wouldn’t be able to. PETA is the mainstream face of animal rights and vegetarianism. . .and that should be troubling to the rest of the movement. They’re the ones who suffer the most from PETA’s insane antics.&lt;/p&gt;

The short history goes something like this: the FCC created strong opt-in (affirmative consent) provisions for the sharing of phone records (who calls whom, for how long, etc).  In 1996, the 10th Circuit held that the restrictions violated the First Amendment rights of companies that wanted to sell this data to marketers.  Thus, the FCC relaxed the standard to opt-out, meaning that you had to take affirmative action to stop your phone records from being sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the burden was upon you?  Probably not!  That's why in 2005, I &lt;a href="http://epic.org/privacy/iei/cpnipet.html"&gt;petitioned&lt;/a&gt; the FCC to reestablish stronger privacy protections, because all sorts of &lt;a href="http://epic.org/privacy/iei/"&gt;investigation companies&lt;/a&gt; were pretexting and obtaining phone records for perverts, stalkers, etc.  The FCC opened a rulemaking and reestablished opt-in protections for phone records again.  The industry sued, arguing that the First Amendment barred opt-in protections.  Today the DC Circuit rejected the industry's argument, holding that the FCC had sufficient justification for the heightened protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what's more important is that the DC Circuit's opinion "gets" privacy.  Many courts conceive of privacy as a way to shield oneself from embarrassment.  The DC Circuit disagreed, writing, "There is a good deal more to privacy than that.  It is widely accepted that privacy deals with determining for oneself when, how and to whom personal information will be disclosed to others.  See Daniel J. Solove, Conceptualizing Privacy, 90 CAL. L. REV. 1087, 1109-10 (2002)."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, "...the carrier's sharing of customer information with a joint venturer or an independent contractor without the customer's consent is itself an invasion of the customer's privacy - the very harm the regulation targets.  In addition, common sense supports the Commission's determination that the risk of unauthorized disclosure of  customer information increases with the number of entities  possessing it.  The Commission therefore reasonably concluded  that an opt-in consent requirement directly and materially  advanced the interests in protecting customer privacy and in ensuring customer control over the information."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow!  In privacy law, courts are often wedded to waiting for some type of harm to arise, such as unwanted telemarketing calls.  They rarely get the idea that it is the data sharing itself that is the problem, and that privacy is about how personal data is controlled.  Good job, Judge Randolph.  Now the burden won't be upon you to shield your phone records from sale to marketers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/the_dc_circuit_gets_privacy_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/OThl4wFX8-o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234593589830"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1889">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b28403995cb510c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Vaccines in court, what next?</title><published>2009-02-14T00:29:18Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T00:29:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/tZRjNsUCuY0/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234592038825"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2165">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a6a3ee3ee21cbea</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><category term="Stem Cells"/><title type="html">Skin cells reprogrammed into heart cells</title><published>2009-02-14T06:12:13Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T06:12:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/skin-cells-reprogrammed-into-heart-cells/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/02/ipsheart.html"&gt;Skin cells reprogrammed into heart cells beating in petri dish&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004397" title=""&gt;A Basal Sauropodomorph (Dinosauria: Saurischia) from the Ischigualasto Formation (Triassic, Carnian) and the Early Evolution of Sauropodomorpha&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The earliest dinosaurs are from the early Late Triassic (Carnian) of South America. By the Carnian the main clades Saurischia and Ornithischia were already established, and the presence of the most primitive known sauropodomorph Saturnalia suggests also that Saurischia had already diverged into Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha. Knowledge of Carnian sauropodomorphs has been restricted to this single species. We describe a new small sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Ischigualsto Formation (Carnian) in northwest Argentina, Panphagia protos gen. et sp. nov., on the basis of a partial skeleton. The genus and species are characterized by an anteroposteriorly elongated fossa on the base of the anteroventral process of the nasal; wide lateral flange on the quadrate with a large foramen; deep groove on the lateral surface of the lower jaw surrounded by prominent dorsal and ventral ridges; bifurcated posteroventral process of the dentary; long retroarticular process transversally wider than the articular area for the quadrate; oval scars on the lateral surface of the posterior border of the centra of cervical vertebrae; distinct prominences on the neural arc of the anterior cervical vertebra; distal end of the scapular blade nearly three times wider than the neck; scapular blade with an expanded posterodistal corner; and medial lamina of brevis fossa twice as wide as the iliac spine. We regard Panphagia as the most basal sauropodomorph, which shares the following apomorphies with Saturnalia and more derived sauropodomorphs: basally constricted crowns; lanceolate crowns; teeth of the anterior quarter of the dentary higher than the others; and short posterolateral flange of distal tibia. The presence of Panphagia at the base of the early Carnian Ischigualasto Formation suggests an earlier origin of Sauropodomorpha during the Middle Triassic.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004457" title=""&gt;Sensory Integration Regulating Male Courtship Behavior in Drosophila&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The courtship behavior of Drosophila melanogaster serves as an excellent model system to study how complex innate behaviors are controlled by the nervous system. To understand how the underlying neural network controls this behavior, it is not sufficient to unravel its architecture, but also crucial to decipher its logic. By systematic analysis of how variations in sensory inputs alter the courtship behavior of a naïve male in the single-choice courtship paradigm, we derive a model describing the logic of the network that integrates the various sensory stimuli and elicits this complex innate behavior. This approach and the model derived from it distinguish (i) between initiation and maintenance of courtship, (ii) between courtship in daylight and in the dark, where the male uses a scanning strategy to retrieve the decamping female, and (iii) between courtship towards receptive virgin females and mature males. The last distinction demonstrates that sexual orientation of the courting male, in the absence of discriminatory visual cues, depends on the integration of gustatory and behavioral feedback inputs, but not on olfactory signals from the courted animal. The model will complement studies on the connectivity and intrinsic properties of the neurons forming the circuitry that regulates male courtship behavior.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000368" title=""&gt;Invasive Snails and an Emerging Infectious Disease: Results from the First National Survey on Angiostrongylus cantonensis in China&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eosinophilic meningitis is caused by the rat lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis). This parasite is endemic in Southeast Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, and on Pacific Islands. Moreover, the disease is emerging in mainland China, which might be related to the spread of two invasive snail species (Achatina fulica and Pomacea canaliculata). Thus far, the biggest angiostrongyliasis outbreak in China occurred in 2006 in Beijing, involving 160 patients. However, detailed information about the national distribution of A. cantonensis and its intermediate hosts is still lacking, and the importance of the two invasive snail species for disease transmission is not well understood. Therefore, a national survey on the distribution of A. cantonensis and its intermediate hosts in China was carried out in 2006/2007. It was found that A. fulica and P. canaliculata were implicated in most angiostrongyliasis outbreaks, and that the distribution of A. cantonensis closely matched that of these snails. The two invasive snail species facilitated the expansion of the parasite, thus probably leading to the emergence of angiostrongyliasis, a previously rare disease, in mainland China.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000031" title=""&gt;An Ancient Gene Network Is Co-opted for Teeth on Old and New Jaws&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During evolution, teeth originated deep in the pharynx of ancient and extinct jawless fishes. Later, with the evolution of bony fish, teeth appeared in the mouth, as in most current vertebrates, although some living fishes retain teeth in the posterior pharynx. We integrate comparative morphology, paleontology, and molecular biology to infer the genetic control of the first dentition. We identify Hox genes as important components of an ancient dental gene-regulatory circuit and pinpoint subsequent modifications to this gene network that accompanied the evolution of toothed oral jaws. Furthermore, we highlight a set of genes conserved in the construction of all teeth, regardless of location and lineage. This core dental gene network is evolutionarily essential: nature appears never to have made a dentition without it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000020" title=""&gt;Malaria Control with Transgenic Mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Malaria has been eliminated from a large part of the world. By the mid-twentieth century both North America and Europe were free of the disease, although both had suffered greatly during the prior century [1,2]. While a variety of means were used to achieve this eradication, the most important are thought to be reducing the number of breeding sites for malaria vectors and improving residential areas to separate humans from mosquitoes. Other parts of the world have not been so fortunate. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is now estimated that there are more than 360 million clinical cases and one million deaths due to malaria each year [3,4]. Furthermore, despite ambitious goals such as those of the Roll Back Malaria Initiative to halve malaria deaths by 2010, mortality from the disease has actually risen halfway through the program [5]. Clearly the tools we have to control malaria, or the ways in which we are using them, are not working. The failure of existing methods for malaria control has sparked interest in several new approaches. These include better and cheaper antimalarial drugs [6], renewed efforts to find a vaccine [7], and the development of genetically modified mosquitoes (GMMs) designed either to reduce population sizes or to replace existing populations with vectors unable to transmit the disease. In this review we describe some of the efforts currently underway to create GMMs and assess some of the obstacles they face.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000284" title=""&gt;Can Monkeys Choose Optimally When Faced with Noisy Stimuli and Unequal Rewards?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Decisions are commonly based on multiple sources of information. In a forced choice task, for example, sensory information about the identity of a stimulus may be combined with prior information about the amount of reward associated with each choice. We employed a well-characterized motion discrimination task to examine how animals combine such sources of information and whether they weigh these components so as to harvest rewards optimally. Two monkeys discriminated the direction of motion in a family of noisy random dot stimuli. The animals were informed before each trial whether reward outcomes were equal or unequal for the two alternatives, and if unequal, which alternative promised the larger reward. Predictably, choices were biased toward the larger reward in the unequal reward conditions. We develop a decision-making model that describes the animals' sensitivities to the visual stimulus and permits us to calculate the choice bias that yields optimal reward harvesting. We find that the monkeys' performance is close to optimal; remarkably, the animals garner 98%+ of their maximum possible rewards. This study adds to the growing evidence that animal foraging behavior can approach optimality and provides a rigorous theoretical basis for understanding the computations underlying optimality in this and related tasks.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_29.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/gx_zf4zf8uE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234570849123"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4156">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de50125a9ccf1a06</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Name the Baby</title><published>2009-02-14T00:25:26Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T00:25:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/name-the-baby.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/2009/02/sf-zoos-baby-gorilla-needs-a-name.html" rel="external "&gt;irresistibly cute baby gorilla&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.sfzoo.org/openrosters/ViewOrgPageLink.asp?LinkKey=26703&amp;amp;orgkey=1821" rel="external "&gt;the San Francisco Zoo&lt;/a&gt; needs a name, and the Zoo is sponsoring a name-the-baby contest. &lt;a href="http://www.sfzoo.org/Registration/CampaignDetail.asp?ActivityKey=539261&amp;amp;OrgKey=1431" rel="external "&gt;You can enter here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This article fascinated me (so much that I stole this story from poor Kristina who actually found the article first) both because of my own struggles with numbers, and because it made me think about strategies for working with and around those struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific learning disabilities like dyscalculia are not part of any ASD DSM diagnostic criteria, but individuals on the spectrum often have specific learning disabilities or uneven skills.  Kristina posted about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/doin_the_math"&gt;Doin' the Math&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, and I confess that, while I am decades older, and have decades more schooling, I still do my arithmetic the same way Kristina's son does--with a calculator and little fondness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My history with math is bizarre.  Even fast approaching middle age, I still can't add single digit numbers or count change, and my scores on arithmetic-oriented IQ subtests are on the way left side of the bell curve.  And oh yes I spent many frustrated hours in the "low" math groups in grade school without learning a thing.  But--I actually understood imaginary numbers when my age was still expressed by a single digit, I was on my middle school math team, and I have aced graduate level mathematics courses.  I don't have a "problem with math" conceptually, but I do have a profound inability to cope, specifically, with numbers.  I can explain exactly why addition works starting from first principles, but I can't actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; addition problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have managed to fool a lot of people into thinking I have more than a second grade (which is perhaps generous) capacity for arithmetic by substituting my mutant power capacity for math-as-pattern.  "Give me thirty cents," someone says, and yes, given a little extra time, I do hand the thirty cents over.  But I didn't use any numbers to do so.  I have memorized the different combinations of coins that map to the phrase "thirty cents."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say that my workarounds--a combination of calculators as accommodations and memorizing patterns as skill substitution--are equal to the ability to actually conceptualize numbers.  Even with a calculator, I have to enter the numbers repeatedly until I end up with the same result more than once.  I need someone else to do my finances and make sure I haven't done something stupid with time.  But when possible, I have found I can use the sort of math I'm good at--patterns and relationships--to accomplish stuff, like program a computer to do my arithmetic for me.  And at that, well enough so that one of my teachers was convinced for a while that I was "good with numbers." (I thought he might faint when he discovered during a conversation with me that I am quite entirely unable to figure out the answer to "what is 1000 times two.")&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234569805501"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/pay-to-play/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4ab30908c3a3e783</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="MMR"/><category term="competing interests"/><category term="regulating research"/><title type="html">Pay to play?</title><published>2009-02-14T00:01:54Z</published><updated>2009-02-14T00:01:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/pay-to-play/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscience.net/" type="html">Ben Goldacre

With my correspondent's permission, I'm sharing the case with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A graduate student, in chatting with a colleague in another lab, happened upon an idea for an experimental side project to do with that colleague.  While the side project fell well outside the research agenda of this graduate student's research group, he first asked his advisor whether it was OK for him to work on the side project.  The advisor was reluctant to allow the student to work on the project, but agreed to give him a relatively short window of time (on the order of weeks, not months) to work on the side project and see if he got any results. &lt;br&gt;

The mother of a 17-month-old child recently posted this question on a &lt;a href="http://community.babycenter.com/talk/a5200656/can_an_asd_tot_have_a_huge_vocabulary"&gt;BabyCenter forum&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://community.babycenter.com/talk/a5200656/can_an_asd_tot_have_a_huge_vocabulary"&gt;Can an ASD tot have a huge vocabulary?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer is, oh yes, and that even though my own son did not &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;at the time he was diagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. (Indeed, for Charlie, it was his lack of language and of any means to communicate that alerted us to his having developmental delays.) As Dora and I wrote on the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/what_is_autism"&gt;What is autism?&lt;/a&gt; page for this site, one feature of autism is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-standard ways of learning and approaching problem solving. For example, learning "difficult" tasks (e.g. calculus) before "simple" tasks (e.g. addition), difficulty with "executive functions," or being simultaneously gifted at tasks requiring fluid intelligence and intellectually disabled at tasks requiring verbal skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An individual might be able to speak with a large vocabulary, but may not yet know all the meanings or functional uses of words. Many of my friends have children on the spectrum who are &lt;a href="http://www.hyperlexia.org/aha_what_is.html"&gt;hyperlexic&lt;/a&gt; and can read beyond their age level, but don't seem (yet) able to comprehend all about what they're reading. (And also note Dora's post yesterday on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/mono-sensing_and_understanding_speech"&gt;mono-sensing and understanding speech&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a young child not developing language---not speaking---is one sign that leads a parent (like Jim and me) to have their child evaluated for autism, it might be said that too many words might be a sign of "something," too. Not that the parent of a child who talks a lot should necessarily be thinking about autism, when it comes to diagnosing autism in a child, there's a lot more to it than language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also conveys his efforts to get in the Californian spirit  (i.e., buying a plasma television he can't afford) or to trade on  Anglophilia when it suits him. The snobbish pronunciation of his name  may sound like a British synonym for derrière, but it helps him finagle  his way into the gala opening of the Frank Gehry-designed  Walt Disney Concert Hall. On the other hand, he makes sure to  Americanize the R in “Ayres” and go native when crashing a  movie-business party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's really no way to figure out what Maslin means here without consulting the book itself, and even then things are a bit murky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Maslin&amp;#39;s summarizing of the two incidents from the book, you might have been able to work out that the usually non-rhotic Ayres rhoticizes his surname when it is convenient for him to do so. But what is the reader of the review supposed to make of the statement that &amp;quot;the snobbish pronunciation of his name  may sound like a British synonym for derrière&amp;quot;? If you&amp;#39;re familiar with the verbal somersaults that typify the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=349"&gt;taboo avoidance strategies&lt;/a&gt; practiced by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, you might be able to discern that &amp;quot;a British synonym for derrière&amp;quot; must refer to &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt;. But then how is &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt; supposed to represent a &amp;quot;snobbish pronunciation&amp;quot; of &lt;em&gt;Ayres&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/080211881X/"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, we can read the passages in question. First, here he is trying to get a ticket for the Walt Disney Concert Hall opening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
    The voice was harried and sour.&lt;br&gt;
  &amp;quot;Ah, yes. Hello. I&amp;#39;m looking for Bianca.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
  &amp;quot;This is she.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Think posh. Think posh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &amp;quot;This is Christopher Ayres.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
    I  pronounced Ayres like Aay-&lt;em&gt;ahs&lt;/em&gt;, with a lingering &amp;quot;s,&amp;quot; and followed the  introduction with the name of my newspaper, ending it with &amp;quot;of London,&amp;quot;  for maximum snob appeal.&lt;br&gt;
  &amp;quot;Ah, Mr. Arse. Hello.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
  &amp;quot;Aay-&lt;em&gt;ahs&lt;/em&gt;. It's Aay-&lt;em&gt;ahs&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m calling about my tickets to the gala.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
    (p. 76)
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here he is crashing the movie-business party:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Name?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br&gt;
    &amp;quot;CHRIS AYRES,&amp;quot; I boomed, leaning over the handbrake and being careful to pronounce the &amp;quot;r,&amp;quot; like Americans do.&lt;br&gt;
    (p. 195)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as best as I can determine from the phonetic respellings in the first anecdote, the &amp;quot;posh&amp;quot; pronunciation that Mr. Ayres used with Bianca was something like [ε:ɑs], though we would expect him to say his name under normal circumstances more like [ε:əz]. Bianca repeated it back to him perhaps as [ɑ:s], for which Ayres uses the non-rhotic pronunciation spelling of &lt;em&gt;Arse&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, such British pronunciation spellings are often lost on rhotic Americans: see my post &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004985.html"&gt;Pinker's alma mater&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for similar examples, such as A.A. Milne&amp;#39;s use of &lt;em&gt;Eeyore&lt;/em&gt; to represent the sound of a donkey (i.e., &lt;em&gt;[h]ee[h]aw&lt;/em&gt;), or Led Zeppelin's use of &lt;em&gt;D'yer Mak'er&lt;/em&gt; as a jokey misinterpretation of &amp;quot;Jamaica&amp;quot; (much more on the latter &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=591"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems a little odd that a British writer would use this sort of non-rhotic pronunciation spelling in a book from an American publisher (Grove Press) for an American audience. But Ayres, like many of his compatriots, may simply be unconcerned with the fact that pronunciation spellings of the &lt;em&gt;Eeyore/D'yer Mak'er&lt;/em&gt; variety don't translate well across the pond. And his editor may not have wanted to question the choice. But even if he or his editor had felt the need to make a change, what would be the alternative to &lt;em&gt;Arse&lt;/em&gt;? A phonetic respelling like &lt;em&gt;Ahhs&lt;/em&gt; would have lost the intended humo(u)r here, namely that Bianca&amp;#39;s reinterpretation of this &amp;quot;posh&amp;quot; pronunciation ended up sounding like the decidedly un-posh &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ass&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, might have preserved the joke for an American audience, but would represent a different pronunciation: [æs].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it's worth recalling that American &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt; [æs] is actually a merger of two British forms: &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt; [ɑ:s] (referring to the body part) and &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt; [æs] (referring to the animal). This point was actually discussed by &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4DF163FF933A05753C1A962958260&amp;amp;sec=&amp;amp;spon=&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;William Safire&lt;/a&gt; in a 1994 &amp;quot;On Language&amp;quot; column in the Times, despite the taboo avoidance of &lt;em&gt;arse &lt;/em&gt; that we see in Maslin's review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;[A]ss&lt;/em&gt; [is] a word not permitted in The New York  Times unless referring to a donkey.&lt;br&gt;
  Editors have lifted this  restriction when quoting Presidents, as in some usages on the Nixon  tapes and in George Bush&amp;#39;s remark (intended to be private) after a  debate that he &amp;quot;really kicked ass.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
  Horses are the genus &lt;em&gt;equus&lt;/em&gt;;  a donkey is an &lt;em&gt;equus asinus&lt;/em&gt;, source of &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt; and the adjective &lt;em&gt;asinine&lt;/em&gt;.  (A jackass is a male donkey; to call a woman a &lt;em&gt;jackass&lt;/em&gt; is a solecism.)  In &amp;quot;The law is a ass,&amp;quot; Charles Dickens was using the sense of &amp;quot;donkey,&amp;quot;  an animal that is thought to be dull-witted.&lt;br&gt;
  The other &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt;, the  absence of which is not a major loss to any medium, is a variant of a  different etymon, &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt;; the r was dropped in common usage, just as  &lt;em&gt;parcel&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;passel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;curse&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;cuss&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it would seem that &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt; (the body part) is off-limits in the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, with exceptions made for metalinguistic discussions like Safire&amp;#39;s and newsworthy  uses by important people like presidents (see my posts &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003367.html"&gt;Taking shit from the President&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005111.html"&gt;Music Review: ********&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; for similar exceptions made for &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt;). Does the same go for &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt;, which doesn't even have the ambiguity of American &lt;em&gt;ass&lt;/em&gt;, since it can only refer to the body part and not the animal? The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; does seem to restrict &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt; usage to what it deems relevant   quotes from newsmakers or works of literature. A search on the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/alternate/query?query=arse&amp;amp;st=fromcse"&gt;Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/alternate/query?query=arse&amp;amp;st=fromcse"&gt; archives&lt;/a&gt; finds various literary examples, such as  &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E0DE1E3CF937A25756C0A9629C8B63"&gt;Eliza Doolittle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Move yer bloomin&amp;#39; arse!&amp;quot; (in a 2004 article on a production of &amp;quot;My Fair Lady&amp;quot;), but also &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/23/world/europe/23harry.html"&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s memorable observation, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no way I&amp;#39;m going to put myself through Sandhurst [Royal Military Academy] and then sit  on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Maslin's review, for whatever reason, &lt;em&gt;arse&lt;/em&gt; was deemed beyond the pale. That made an already difficult-to-decipher bit of dialect play just about impenetrable. If taboo avoidance strategies throw up one veil too many, how about just avoiding the avoidance to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;

actually happened a couple of weeks ago, but didn’t get much press: On February 2, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/03/iran-satellite-launch-omid"&gt;Iran has successfully launched a satellite into space using its own domestically-built technology&lt;/a&gt;, a first (another satellite of theirs was launched in 2005 on a Russian booster). Called Omid (&amp;quot;Hope&amp;quot;), it is ostensibly a telecommunications satellite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the face of it, this may be a good thing. More countries seeking access to space is better for everyone. However, of course, Iran is run by a theocratic system with a fundamentalist bent, so I’m not overly thrilled with this. I’m glad it happened once Bush was out of office, since he was rattling his saber about Iran. Still, this event has stoked some fears, reasonably, that Iran has intercontinental missile capabilities; if you can get to orbit, you can potentially place a warhead anywhere on Earth you want. But in and of itself the launch is not a threatening event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that &lt;a href="http://www.mahalo.com/Iran_Fake_Missile_Photo"&gt;Iran faked a missile launch photo last July&lt;/a&gt;, but independent observers have verified the satellite launch (&lt;a href="http://www.n2yo.com/satellite/?s=33506"&gt;it even has a NORAD ID number&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ll see where this goes. There’s not really much more to say here, except that I hope Iran is serious when it says that this was for peaceful purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234559330963"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/luskin_flaunts_his_persecution.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b22f177d15575986</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Luskin flaunts his persecution complex, again</title><published>2009-02-13T20:24:26Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T20:24:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/7OckLIyLOls/luskin_flaunts_his_persecution.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/luskin_flaunts_his_persecution.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shorter Casey Luskin: &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/room-for-debate/2009/02/12/darwin-believers-hide-fears-of-intelligent-design-behind-a-wall-of-denial-and-ridicule.html"&gt;Waa, waa — they call me mean names&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, that&amp;#39;s the whole of his extended whine in US News &amp;amp; World Report, a long complaint that &amp;quot;darwinists&amp;quot; aren&amp;#39;t nice to him. It&amp;#39;s pathetic, but that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve come to expect from Mr Squeaky. You really only need two pieces of information. 1) His opening paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Darwinists involved in the public debate today have one, and only one goal: To stifle free debate on this subject and thereby discourage you, the public, from scrutinizing the scientific evidence for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And 2) the knowledge that he wrote a &lt;i&gt;6800 word opinion piece&lt;/i&gt; that never once mentions any of that hypothetical scientific evidence for ID. Not one tiny scrap. You know, if I had 6800 words that I began with the assertion that I had scientific evidence for an idea that a shadowy cabal was keeping from the public, I think I'd take advantage of that opportunity to reveal the hidden wisdom that had been suppressed.

Because I foresaw this day coming, however, I did set up a series of "Best of" reposts to autopost for you while I am in mourning. Some I have even updated and/or spiffed up with actual editing. If you've been reading less than a year or two, they're new to you. If not, I hope you enjoy them again. I don't know when I'll be back, other than maybe a brief update or two. It could be a couple of days; it could be a couple of weeks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Although it had been percolating under the radar of most parents and scientists for several years before, this belief invaded the national &lt;em&gt;zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt; in a big way in 2005, beginning with the publication of a book by journalist David Kirby entitled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.evidenceofharm.com"&gt;Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The fires of hysteria were stoked even higher by &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.robertfkennedyjr.com/articles/2005_june_16.html"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, who published a truly &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/from_the_vaults_rfk_jr_gets_hi.php"&gt;twisted and misleading piece of pseudojournalism and pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt; published simultaneously in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7395411/deadly_immunity/"&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/06/16/thimerosal/"&gt;Salon.com&lt;/a&gt; entitled &lt;em&gt;Deadly Immunity&lt;/em&gt;. Relying primarily on &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/06/robert_f_kenned.html"&gt;quote-mining&lt;/a&gt; of the transcripts of both a conference held Atlanta by the CDC to discuss the question of whether autism is related to thimerosal in vaccines and an &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/06/lies_damn_lies_.html"&gt;Institute of Medicine report on vaccines&lt;/a&gt; while simultaneously misrepresenting the results of &lt;a href="http://autismnaturalvariation.blogspot.com/2006/11/verstraeten-et-al-gambit.html"&gt;two studies by Verstaeten &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to paint a false picture of a government coverup, RFK Jr. almost single-handedly managed to stoke fears that vaccines were causing an "epidemic of autism."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say "almost" single-handedly, because, unfortunately, he had help. Relying on the dubious research of a variety of investigators, such as the &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/140/"&gt;father-and-son team of Dr. Mark Geier and David Geier&lt;/a&gt;, whose prodigious output of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/the_geiers_go_dumpsterdiving_y_1.php"&gt;badly designed studies&lt;/a&gt; emanating from a lab in their home in suburban Maryland, done using a &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/98/an-elusive-institute-significant-misrepresentations-mark-geier-david-geier-the-evolution-of-the-lupron-protocol-part-two"&gt;rubberstamp institutional review board&lt;/a&gt; stacked with friends and cronies to approve the studies, and published for the most part in non-peer-reviewed journals, activists loudly insisted that mercury in vaccines was the cause of most autism. Others claiming to demonstrate this link include Boyd Haley, a chemist from the University of Kentucky, and a few other vocal scientists and advocates, who claim that autism is, in essence, &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=228"&gt;mercury poisoning&lt;/a&gt;. Facilitating the dissemination of this message were reporters such as David Kirby, activists such as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and media personalities such as Don Imus. Indeed, some activists claimed that some vaccines were "poisoning" our children, even going so far as show photos of autistic children with the label "&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.vaccinationnews.net/DailyNews/July2001/AutismUniqueMercPoison.htm"&gt;mercury-poisoned&lt;/a&gt;" underneath them on placards held aloft at protest rallies. They made quite a splash then, and still do to a lesser extent even today. There's just one problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/mercury_in_vaccines_as_a_cause_of_autism.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/mercury_in_vaccines_as_a_cause_of_autism.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/jL_TKzwBhsU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234555670464"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5984">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53f0c229a788667a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition, 2.13</title><published>2009-02-13T20:00:04Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T20:00:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5984" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1beafebbab2576c2ae4319408c7858f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://z.about.com/d/graphicssoft/1/5/m/O/1/azk14-valentine-heart1.gif" alt="" width="183"&gt;I’ve never been a big fan of Valentine’s Day. When I was single, it was at worst a reminder of my solitude, at best an evening when you couldn’t get a reservation for a decent restaurant.  When I was with someone, it seemed like it was a holiday of forced romance and unreasonable expectations. Somewhat doomed to fail. That being said, I’ve had some very pleasant Valentine’s Day experiences, mostly because I have a husband who takes it about as seriously as I do and generally, when we go out, we enjoy each others’ company and have a good time.  But this isn’t about me, of course. Your question for the day (and you knew this was coming):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valentine’s Day - love it or hate it?

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“During its regular trustees meeting this morning, President Lou Anna Simon said MSU would be disproportionately damaged by the governor’s plan. That’s because a 3.1% cut to MSU’s state appropriations – dropping the university’s slice to $284 million — i&lt;strong&gt;s compounded by a proposal to combine MSU’s extension services and experimental stations and cut the budgets of the two entities from $64 million combined to $32 million.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (emphasis mine)&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The extension service is a hallmark of the land-grant university. With offices covering the state, its mission is to disseminate research and university expertise that is important to Michiganders – from health and wellness to agriculture to food safety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an amazingly stupid idea. Cutting back on Extension–when the state’s second largest industry, and the &lt;a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/index.ssf/2009/02/sat_states_agriculture_economy.html"&gt;only viable one right now&lt;/a&gt;–is Agriculture…..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no words for how bad an idea that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the Comment o’ the Week (COTW!), yesterday I held a little contest on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/rebeccawatson"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, in which I asked my followers (that sounds very culty, I apologize) to provide me with fun new Darwinian pick-up lines, in honor of both Chuck D.’s birthday and Valentine’s Day. We did this &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=402"&gt;before here on Skepchick&lt;/a&gt; with hilarious results, and my Twitter-friends did not disappoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the whole lot of them &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23darwinpickup"&gt;here since they were cleverly marked with the phrase #DarwinPickup&lt;/a&gt;. I had a few favorites and thus found it difficult to choose which would receive the coveted prize of a pin (a pin!) with the pick-up line inscribed upon it. I narrowed it down to three:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/amandable"&gt;@amandable&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby, your phenotype makes me want to unload my haploid gametes onto your mammalian protuberances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is awesome and includes a reference to Zappa, AND it was the clear favorite of those people who were following along via my Facebook page. However! Amanda writes for Skepchick and thus is declared ineligible. Aw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That left the following two, which were retweeted the most:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Geran_Smith"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Geran_Smith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were an enzyme, I would be DNA Helicase so I could unzip your genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/uksceptic"&gt;@ukskeptic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I said your body was the product of inherited traits would you hold it against me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of those were so fab, I’m going to declare dual winners! I’ll put each phrase on buttons and make them available in the &lt;a href="https://www.spreadshirt.com/shop.php?sid=32878&amp;amp;op=articles&amp;amp;p=1"&gt;Skepchick store&lt;/a&gt; soon. (They’re not there yet because I have to design them . . . if any graphic designers would like to do it for me, please let me know!) Geran_Smith &amp;amp; UKSkeptic, please send your mailing addresses to me at skepchick@skepchick.org and I’ll get your prizes to you asap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENT O’ THE WEEK!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Since I handed out two winners in the Darwinian pick-up line contest, I’m going to do the same for the COTW. First up is &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5964&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-51606"&gt;James K&lt;/a&gt;, who shares his slightly less than sentimental view of the past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James K&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d9e62d479002018916c3dfed629e23a?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Feb 12, 2009 at 10:05 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 16th Century France, cat burning was a common pubic entertainment. People of all classes would come together and delight as a cat dies in the least pleasant way imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years slavery, rape and genocide were the standard practice in war, and war was much more common in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I’m concerned the past can go to hell.  I’m only putting up with the present until something better comes along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking of putting that last line on a t-shirt in the store, as well. Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-winner this week is the amusingly-named &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5916&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-51041"&gt;CatFurniture&lt;/a&gt;, commenting on the news that a woman donated an organ in an uncommon way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that my kidney in your vagina, or are you just glad to see me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short and sweet and filthy, just how we like it here on Skepchick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to CatFuniture and James K! You win gads and gads of new pick-up lines, all of which either have to do with Charles Darwin or a kidney emerging from a vagina. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

One of the things that makes this possible is the availability of assistive technology for education.  Screen readers, speech-to-text systems, and speech devices are just some of the assistive technology that enables autistic students and others with communication, movement, or learning disabilities to succeed at college.  Since purchase of this technology can be prohibitively expensive, and is often not covered under insurance, free AT labs like &lt;a href="http://library.pdx.edu/assistive.html"&gt;Assistive Technology Center&lt;/a&gt; (ATC) at my university may be the only thing enabling students to get the education they deserve.  So imagine my outrage when I learned that there were plans to abolish the ATC and put in--are you sitting down?--&lt;em&gt;a coffee shop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ATC was started by students in the 1980's and became staffed by employees of &lt;a href="http://www.accesstechnologiesinc.org/"&gt;Accesss Technologies, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; in 1995; Portland State University (PdxSU) pays for half the operating costs of the center and provides the lab space.  The ATC provides free technology (including training) for students with a wide variety of disabilities, including learning, orthopedic, and visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ATC does not limit itself just PdxSU students either.  It provides &lt;em&gt;free assistive technology training, evaluation, and other services for the community at large&lt;/em&gt;.  ATC has helped me and others to get or use speech devices, something many of us would never be able to afford otherwise.  I've also worked with ATC to test my research group's web pages for accessibility using popular screen readers.  ATC's benefits reach far beyond a single student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I got an email from the head of the ATC that said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the changing economic climate on the [PdxSU] campus, we are under increasing pressure to demonstrate to various administrators what the assistive technology center is doing for students. If you are a former or current [PdxSU] STUDENT and you feel strongly that the assistive tech center is important to your success as a student.  Please consider taking time out of your busy schedule to write a paragraph or two about what we have done for you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kind of flipped out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How desperate is this, what is going on," I wrote back--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer, "They are talking about sizable cuts, as well as moving or shutting down the lab (the library wants a coffee shop of all things)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coffee shop of all things.  Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, you know, those 270 other coffee shops in, on, and next to campus are of course not enough.  Apparently access to coffee is more important than access to education.  How foolish I was to think school might be about learning, bad Dora!&lt;/p&gt;

That seems to be pretty much the entire game, and the accompanying moral outrage is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/02/12/amazon-sells-rape-si.html"&gt;This boingboing article&lt;/a&gt; has alleged footage of the game, which I’ve watched, and it doesn’t show any rape, just some kissing-and-running away. There are no screenshots of any rape, and the only evidence that the game contains rape is in descriptions online. I haven’t seen any testimony from anyone who has played the game, and indeed the story broke in the Belfast Telegraph with reference to MP Keith Vaz, who has a vested interest in finding evidence that British kids are playing rape sims because he claimed such in parliment, and was roundly shouted down. Apparently the game was available briefly on amazon, there is an archived page (although it could be fake I suppose) linked in the Belfast Telegraph coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has one of the lowest rape statistics in the world, some twenty times lower than the USA. Is this because there is less rape, or because it’s not reported? Japan has low crime rates generally, so I would hazard it’s a bit of both. If it is indeed a country that has produced a rape simulation game, where is the evidence that such a game is harmful? It’s certainly tasteless, but I don’t find rape any worse a crime than the violent assaults and murders the average GTA game asks players to commit. In fact, I will stick my neck out and say on balance, I’d rather be raped than murdered (I’d much rather neither but you know what I mean), although that is a ridiculously simplistic way of looking at it. But this is the gaming world, not the real world, so if we’re saying it’s OK to maim and kill in a game, why is it not OK to rape in a game? Is raping worse than deliberately driving your car into a pedestrian? Remember, we’re not talking real life here, we’re talking simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe there is any evidence linking in-game crime to any increase in real-life crime. Given the Japan rape statistics and what must be a relatively small demand for a rape sim, I can’t see how this is worse than the sort of thing you can buy in any USA or UK game store. The difference is, you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; buy this game here, and if it’s true that amazon’s quality control slipped for a moment and has since been rectified, that certainly isn’t a reflection on any potential demand, and despite several generations’ penchant for shooting game characters in the head or beating them with a baseball bat, I seriously doubt many of those gamers are going to want Rapelay. Perhaps what we really should be worried about is the arbitrary line we’ve drawn between acceptable in-game crime and ‘oh that’s just wrong’. Moral outrage is not consistent, but if simulated rape is not OK then neither is simulated whatever-onscreen-crime-you’ll-commit-this-weekend. Myself, I’m shooting soldiers in the head with my sniper in Valkyria Chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234546548279"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7701602409231323080">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc68b3ecf9d55d24</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Moving Darwin</title><published>2009-02-13T16:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T17:33:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/moving-darwin.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7701602409231323080/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7701602409231323080" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> A statue of Charles Darwin was sculpted by Sir Joseph Boehm in 1885.

Since they cannot grasp why I'm doing what I'm doing they falsely conclude I'm angry at God. But I'm no more angry with a God that doesn't exist than Christians are angry with Allah or Zeus. So let me explain one more time:&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Motivations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I backed into what I’m doing right now. I initially wanted to explain to people who knew me why I rejected the Christian faith, because several people were surprised about this and they wanted to know. To do this I self-published my first book to explain my reasons. At that point in my mind I was done with the Christian faith. I fully expected to get on with life. Unexpectedly though, I got noticed as a former student of William Lane Craig’s. It hadn’t occurred to me this was important, but people on both sides took notice of it. So I began engaging in the debate online and found the Christian reasoning lame and offensive in the circles I frequented. I was personally attacked by these Christians. This challenged me to no end. It made me want to go for the jugular vein of the faith that justified their abusive treatment of me. I wondered to myself whether they would light the fires that burned me at the stake in a previous century when the church had the power to do so. This made me think about the many heretics who suffered at the hands of Christians because of this same mentality. I decided at that point I would not let their blood be shed in vain, so I took up their cause. It became personal with me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I began reading more and more skeptical books and found most of their attempts just as lame as the arguments of believers in defense of their faith. I like challenges. I like attempting and succeeding where others fail. That’s who I am. I wondered to myself if I could break through the barrier between Christian believers and non-believers and speak to believers in ways they could relate to. There were just too many authors on both sides of the fence who were merely “preaching to the choir,” so to speak, so I entered the fray with that goal in mind as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This probably explains my initial motivations the most.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I have additional motivations. I will cease to exist someday so I would like to know I made a difference in this world. I want to leave the world a better place. And I think a world with fewer believers will be a good thing. I want to help change the religious landscape. I believe there are inherent dangers with religious beliefs. I also want to help people who are struggling with their Christian faith to know there are others out there like me. I believe that life is better from my perspective, having been a former Christian myself. I can be more...well...human. And I think I am uniquely qualified to do what I'm doing as a former apologist for the Christian faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that, my motivations are now as multifaceted as any author of any book. Like every author who spends a great deal of time writing a book, I’m pleased to hear that people are reading through it and are recommending it very highly. I'm pleased to be recognized by my peers. I also like being asked to speak for groups and to debate the issues between us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there you have it. It's not really that hard to understand, is it?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

And that is a reason for having some reservations. There is no paper yet, and science by press release raises my hackles, and has done so ever since the cold fusion debacle. Not that I think this is a hoax or error by any means, but it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a good way to present a scientific observation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the work has some major limitations right now. They&amp;#39;ve got about 60% of the genome so far, and it&amp;#39;s all entirely from one specimen. From the age of these bones, degradation is inevitable, so there are almost certainly corrupted sequences in there — more coverage would give me much more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those caveats, though, there are some tantalizing hints, and the subject  is so exciting that it's understandable why there'd be rush to announce. So far, they've identified approximately 1000-2000 amino acid differences in the coding part of the genome (human-chimp differences are about 50,000 amino acids), but there's no report of any detectable regulatory differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm withholding judgement until I see a real paper; for now, you have to settle for a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/323/5916/866/DC1"&gt;podcast with a science journalist&lt;/a&gt;, which just isn't meaty enough yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/neandertal_genome_or_a_prematu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/QpHViUqTRO4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234544349279"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/friday_cephalopod_orange_bottl.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b2453ee4146e254c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Orange bottletail</title><published>2009-02-13T16:08:29Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T16:08:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/ZGRHb2UmvZM/friday_cephalopod_orange_bottl.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/friday_cephalopod_orange_bottl.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/sepiadarium_kochi.jpeg" width="425" height="277" alt="sepiadarium_kochi.jpeg"&gt;

Now, though, they've also published a &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/12/evolution-creation-proof-opinions-darwin_0212_jerry_coyne.html"&gt;broadside from Jerry Coyne&lt;/a&gt; that demolishes the five creationists. His primary focus is on Egnor (but just as much could be said against any of them), and he doesn't hold back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does he so readily dismiss a theory that has been universally accepted by scientists for over a century?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Apparently because a rather old book, Michael Denton's Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, first published in 1985, convinced him that evolutionary theory was underlain by very weak evidence. If Egnor had bothered to look just a little into Denton's book and its current standing, he would have learned that the arguments in it have long since been firmly refuted by scientists. Indeed, they were recanted by Denton himself in a later book more than 10 years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since Egnor is decades out of date and shows no sign of knowing anything at all about evolutionary biology in the 21st century, one wonders what could have inspired his declaration at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's more, much more. Read it all if you enjoy watching an intellectual mauling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Coyne did not hold back in criticizing the magazine, either — and Forbes published it all without edits. That&amp;#39;s to their credit, but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel that there&amp;#39;s a callous calculation here, that even arguments against the quality of their publication are seen as a way to boost circulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only "controversy" is social and political: Will Americans, in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution, be allowed to impose a false, religiously based view of biology in the public schools? This "teach the controversy" approach, so popular among fundamentalists, ill suits a publication with the gravitas of Forbes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Can we expect that it will balance stories on medicine with the competing views of shamans, Christian Scientists and spiritual healers? Will articles on the Holocaust be rebutted by the many Holocaust deniers? When the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing rolls around this July, will Forbes give a say to paranoids who think the landing was a fraud, staged on a movie lot?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This, in effect, is what Forbes has done by giving equal time to evolution-deniers. Journalists have an obligation to be fair, but this doesn't mean that they must give charlatans a prestigious platform from which to broadcast their lies. By doing so, Forbes has debased both journalism and science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Exactly. Why would anyone go to that gang of charlatans at the Discovery Institute for articles on evolution? Because idiocy sells?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/forbes_gets_slapped_around_som.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xEUBttIn3tE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234543517126"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1140">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/368ba9e9f1b8d0dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><category term="Syntax"/><category term="prepositions"/><title type="html">V + P~Ø</title><published>2009-02-13T16:44:36Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T16:44:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1140" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;March approaches, and just before the Ides of March (on the 13th and 14th, specifically) comes the Stanford Semantics Festival. This is the 10th; a program, with abstracts, will soon be up on the &lt;a href="http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/linguistics/"&gt;Stanford Linguistics&lt;/a&gt; site.  As usual, I&amp;#39;m giving a paper (I&amp;#39;m not actually a semanticist, but I play one annually at SemFest), this year on verbs taking either direct or oblique objects — with extensive references to postings on Language Log and ADS-L. The paper is a follow-up to my &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005400.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from last year's SemFest, on "diathesis alternations".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract is below. (Remember that this is just an abstract, not the whole paper. It's much compressed and also lacks most of the references.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;V + P~Ø&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Verbs abound in English that can occur, with very similar meanings, either with direct objects (the Ø option) or with oblique objects (the P option), and new ones are being added all the time, either by “transitivizing P-drop” (British “They agreed a draft constitution” ‘They agreed on/to a draft constitution’) or by “intransitivizing P-addition” (&lt;em&gt;love on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ‘cuddle, caress, show affection for’). Some of these pairs have been around for a considerable time (&lt;em&gt;beware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;), &lt;em&gt;flee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)), and many of the transitives have been the object of proscriptivist scorn (transitive &lt;em&gt;abscond&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; ‘take, steal’ and transitive &lt;em&gt;depart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Each pair has its own history, its own syntactic peculiarities, its own semantic/pragmatic profile, and its own sociolinguistic profile (transitive &lt;em&gt;protest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is American, and is objected to by many British speakers and usage critics, who insist on &lt;em&gt;protest against&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;; the situation is reversed for transitive &lt;em&gt;agree&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. So far as I can tell, the variants in each pair almost always differ semantically or pragmatically or both, though this difference is often subtle, so that in many contexts the difference is not especially salient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The virtue of the Ø option is brevity, plus an implicature of close relationship between the denotation of the verb and the denotation of the object (affectedness, directness). When usage critics prefer this option in a particular case, they generally appeal to brevity (Omit Needless Words) and disregard possible meaning differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. The virtue of the P option is (relative) explicitness, plus an implicature of more distant relationship between the denotation of the verb and the denotation of the object. Compare “I played the piano for hours” (direct) and “I played on the piano for hours” (oblique). When usage critics prefer this option in a particular case, they generally appeal to explicitness (Include All Necessary Words) and disregard possible meaning differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On points 2-4, consider the discussion of &lt;em&gt;approve&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) on Language Log (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=156"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), prompted by William Safire’s recommendation of “I approve this message” rather than “I approve of this message” (in line with U.S. legal requirements on the labeling of political messages). Safire supported his recommendation with appeals to historical precedence, a judgment on his part that the oblique variant sounds “elitist”, and Omit Needless Words, but neglected the considerable meaning difference between the two variants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. There is considerable pressure towards transitivization, especially when the P is selected by the V, as in &lt;em&gt;depend on&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (which has developed a transitive variant, in “We depended them for support” and the like). In such cases the P is dispensable, because it contributes little to the meaning of&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;V+P.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But its archaeology is rich regardless of what period you look at. My maternal great-granddad's people came from Tanum and Kville parishes, so I'm sort of a Bohuslän aborigine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a Medieval shipwreck off the Bohuslän coast was &lt;a href="http://www.utgangspunkten.se/kulturvast_templates/Kultur_ArticlePageWide.aspx?id=45730"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt;. Or rather, the wreck has been known for centuries, and local tradition held it to date from the grim early-18th century reign of warrior king Carolus XII. Now maritime archaeologist Staffan von Arbin from the County Museum has secured samples dating the vessel's construction to between 1310 and 1350. The samples also indicate England as the timber's most probable country of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be a historically documented shipwreck: on 20 February 1361, King Edward III of England wrote to King Magnus Eriksson of Sweden and Norway with a complaint regarding the latter's seizure of goods from an English ship that had foundered right about the place where the newly dated wreck is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I had to check it out and what I found was even better than I hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irene Kochevar and Robert Redmond of the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, have &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/22088/"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; a way to close wounds using lasers which is even better than conventional stitches using a needle and thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laser healing seems counter intuitive doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasers cause wounds or at least they stun you right? Wait…that’s a phaser not a laser…never mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, tests done on patients show that their wounds heal faster and with less scarring. The bond that is created is also strong and water-tight so cases of infection should be greatly diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="laserheal1" src="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/laserheal1.jpg" alt="laserheal1" width="220" height="330"&gt;Using lasers to suture skin is actually not a new idea; scientists have been trying for years but finding the proper balance has been difficult. Too little laser and nothing much happens, too much laser and you have 3rd degree burns. It then occurred to someone that maybe they should focus on the light itself and not the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where chemical dyes come into the picture. Opthamologists frequently use a dye called Rose Bengal to stain their patient’s corneas to find lesions. It turns out that when this dye is coupled with a precise frequency of laser light, something very cool happens. The scientists believe that when you put Rose Bengal onto an open would and then activate the dye with a laser, electrons leave the dye and produce free radicals in the skin’s collagen. Free radicals are very reactive and this causes the little molecular chains of collagen to bond to one another which then knits the skin back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We call this nano suturing,” Kochevar says, “because what you’re doing is linking together the little collagen fibers. It’s way beyond anything that a thread of any kind can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Stern, a professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School and chief of dermatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston is impressed with this technology but believes that it still needs to prove itself in terms of cost benefit. A needle and thread is pretty cheap after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw Kochevar in a &lt;a href="http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1827871101/bctid10122299001"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; though and she said that all that will eventually be needed is a small laser a little bigger than a laser pointer and a disposable little packet of the dye. That doesn’t seem too expensive to me. I’ll pay that extra amount for less scarring and less infection any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the immediate future of this photo-chemical tissue bonding?&lt;br&gt;
Well, the next step is submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval which will usher in the next round of human trials. Animal experiments have already had great success with nerve, eye, and blood vessel surgeries. This is especially important because suturing something like a nerve with a needle and thread causes inevitable damage.  Kochevar anticipates clinical use in 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are limitations of course. Deep tissue will still need to be sutured because the light can’t penetrate far. It also won’t work on dark or opaque tissue like liver and bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one real problem with this is the Star Trek comparison. It’s not a very good one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logan’s Run would be much better.&lt;/p&gt;

He had been seeing a DC/ND for a variety of symptoms that turned out to be asthma. Not that the DC/ND made that diagnosis. His DC/ND diagnosed him with an infection, based on live blood analysis, and offered the patient a colonic detox as a cure. My patient thought he should get a second opinion before he submitted to a cleansing enema, always a good policy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live blood analysis to diagnose an infection. I had never heard of the technique, but thanks to the google and the interwebs, I was soon immersed in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In live blood analysis, the “physician” takes a drop of the patients blood and examines it under a high power phase contrast or a darkfield microscope. Changes in the constituents of the blood are noted and linked to a variety of ills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an impressive and expensive system: microscopes and various support equipment start at around $5000 (3). However, live blood analysis has the opportunity to be lucrative in the right hands as the patient often gets weekly analysis to see how the interventions (usually supplements sold by the blood analyst) are working. Evidently in the hands of a skilled snake oil salesman, an income of $100,000 a year to more can be generated (8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live blood analysis is one of these alternative methodologies that has a hint of legitimacy that is extrapolated far out of proportion to its validity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase contrast and darkfield microscopes are used in medicine, in my world primarily to look for syphilis. As a rule, most pathologic changes in the blood are best seen when various stains are applied to the blood sample. Most commonly a Wright”s stain is used on blood cells, because many diagnostic features are invisible on phase contrast. There are many different stains used in the pathology laboratory to help identify what you are observing under the microscope. Using different stains on microbial specimens can help categorize organisms before they can grow. It is not either-or, both phase contrast and other modalities are used in clinical medicine. More practical clinical information is derived from light microscopy on stained specimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An evaluation of the cells of the blood can give hints to the presence or cause of many diseases, from vitamin deficiencies to infection to leukemia. The CBC (complete blood count) with or without a differential (the types of cells seen) is part of any initial evaluation of ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With live blood analysis, practitioners take the seed of truth that the evaluation of the blood constituents can give valuable information and grow a forrest of fantasy and magic. It is something to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides live blood, some practitioners also practice dry blood analysis, where they examine clot to look for patterns that are allegedly indicative of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s evaluate each diagnosis made on live blood analysis. Note the key feature of each alleged diagnosis. The problem lies in diet, and supplements are the solution to the problem, which, it just so happens, are sold by the live blood analyst. Curious that while I am alleged to be a shill of big pharma, I do not get dime one from any supplements or other products sold in my office because I don’t sell stuff to my patients. Any alternative provider who makes part of their living from selling supplements has far more conflict of interest than most physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone may argue that I am an Infectious Disease doctor, what do I know about blood analysis. I also showed these photographs to a hematopathologist and a hematologist. It was refreshing how they laughed and laughed and laughed at the descriptions I showed them of live blood analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live blood analysis evidently began with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnther_Enderlein"&gt;Gunther Enderlein&lt;/a&gt; at the turn of the last century. He was in the Bechamp school of disease etiology and his concepts are unintelligible in the context of modern biology and physiology. Enderlein placed blood under a darkflield microscope and interpreted the artifacts he saw as quasi-life forms, which he called protits, symbionts or endobionts, that could transform into pathogens (11). Only Live Blood analysts can see these forms. As one site says “Enderlein’s “Endobiont” only had meanings to dark field microscopists following his teaching (10).” There is large inter-operator variability in analyzing live blood and no two live blood analysts see the same pathologic changes on the same slide (7). Live blood analysis is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-rays"&gt;N-Ray&lt;/a&gt; of microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overtime live blood analysis expanded to include multiple diet related diagnosis, and is sometimes called nutritional blood analysis, the better, I suppose, to sell expensive supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that copyright laws prevent me from showing specific examples to blood analysis, so I add the link instead. Lots of clicking back and forth, I know, but I do respect intellectual property, although to apply the word “intellectual” to live blood analysis is akin to calling a naturopath a doctor. Lets say I respect their property. These photographs are widely reproduced on the net, but I am uncertain as to who, if anyone, owns the copyright, so I will be careful. There is evidently one lawyer for every 265 Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rouleau&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/hematology/HessEDD/BenignHematologicDisorders/redbloodcelldisorders/rouleaux.cfm"&gt;http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/hematology/HessEDD/BenignHematologicDisorders/redbloodcelldisorders/rouleaux.cfm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real medicine rouleau is an anomaly seen with paraproteinemias such as multiple myeloma. The extra proteins in the blood alter the charge on red cells, causing them to stack like coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of live blood analysis, the are more causes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Often poor protein digestion. The pancreas may be off. Excess dietary protein, poor assimilation. Eating too much animal protein. Blood too toxic (altered blood pH) from stress, coffee, cigarettes, meat, etc. Dehydration, not drinking enough water (2).” None of these issues is known to cause rouleau formation. However, it you have multiple myeloma and you see a live blood analyst, the chance of having a serious and important diagnosis misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated is high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other photos here: &lt;a href="http://healthenlightenment.com/live-blood-cell-analysis.shtml"&gt;http://healthenlightenment.com/live-blood-cell-analysis.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RBC&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Aggregation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The loss of the negative surface charge; this is a more disorganizing symptom where plasma acids act as molecular glue, causing RBCs to stick together (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Live Blood Analysis Diploma Course (1)” says it is due to “ingestion of high fat meals, high blood cholesterol levels, and blood fat chemistry imbalances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. That is not the cause of red cell aggregation outside of Dr. Young, the acid maven. There are no plasma acids that act as a molecular glue. Diet does not make red cells stick together, unless you dine on Elmer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein Linkage   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over acidity and blood pH imbalance. The diet is high in strong acids from proteins and carbohydrates. (0)” Perhaps “digestive insufficiency, excess protein consumption, imbalanced electrolytes, and inability to assimilate lipids or toxicity (1). ” A pathologic finding due to an excess and an insufficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a made up nonsense. Blood pH is constant at 7.4 and varies not at all except under severe metabolic derangements like diabetic ketoacidosis and sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macrocytes, Microcytes   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ingestion of an excessive amount of over acidic food and drinks which causes a deficiency of sodium bicarbonate in the alkalophile glands (4).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrocytes are most often due to B12 or folate deficiency, although there are other causes like AZT and hypothyroidism. Microcytes are most often due to iron deficiency and can be a marker of bowel cancer. Microcytes and macrocytes on a smear can represent serious underlying diseases, but are not due to “a deficiency of sodium bicarbonate in the alkalophile glands. ” Missing the real cause of these abnormalities could prove fatal, which, with their erroneous understanding of blood cell morphology, live blood analysts would be prone to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echinocytes   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Latent tissue acidosis in the extra cellular fluid and the body’s inability to remove acid waste build up in the blood causing the cells to break down (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, latent tissue acidosis is not the cause of echinocytes. These are pathologic and a marker of liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibrous Thallus   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indicates a nationalization of bacteria, yeast/fungus, mold, and their acid wastes and acid crystals lying in a dormant/inactive state (0).” Sounds worrisome. Biomedx says “The presence of large numbers of protoplast structures in peripheral blood is an unfavorable sign. Some authors propose they are a collection of progenitor cryptocides (Livingston-Wheeler). Progenitor meaning existing across millennia at the beginning, cryptocides meaning cellular killer. Protoplasts are thought to be related with infectious disease or neoplastic activity and or L-form bacteria. They are thought to be viral in origin (5).” Try as I might, I cannot understand what any of this means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at the photograph, what is seen is artifact of the slide, not a constituent of blood. Schmutz. Slides are not pristine and stray bits of cloth, cells and environmental dirt is common on the cells. A skilled microscopist understands the difference between artifact and real pathology. The patient, however, does not, and if I were not knowledgeable about cellular morphology I would be most impressed to see a large fibrous thallus in my blood. The explanation of fibrous thallus is nonsensical pseudoscientific gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibrin Spicules   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Involved in clotting to prevent internal bleeding. There is usually an increase during detoxification with the complete program and effective diet because the body is pulling acids stored in the connective tissues back into bloodstream for elimination (1).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass is good at causing fibrin to precipitate out of blood, so occasionally you will see clot on the slide. Some of the photos in the net are artifact, some are fibrin, and all are the normal response to blood on glass. Again, the explanation is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mold   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeast overgrowth, collection of yeast, bacterial, fungus, mold. very toxic. Indicated in advanced stages of latent tissue acidosis. Highly disruptive to normal blood circulation (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never see mould in the blood in people who are not in the ICU dying of sepsis and profound immunocompromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not mold, they are artifacts on the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target Cells   &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fermenting RBCs; White spots or white yeast forms inside RBCs; Indicates the diet is too high in carbohydrates/simple sugars; sugar intolerance and/or imbalance; endocrine system/ pancreas stress (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red cells do not ferment and yeast do not live in red cells. This is fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeast&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Born out of RBCs due to blood pH Imbalance from latent tissue acidosis; diet too high in protein, carbohydrates/ sugars; may be caused by excess antibiotic use, hormonal therapy, steroid use; fungal outfection (0)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is artifact, not yeasts. Yeasts can only been seen in people dying of overwhelming sepsis from profound neutropenia. Yeasts are not “born out of RBC’s.” More nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platelets  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“High counts are due to latent tissue acidosis and excess acids in the bloodstream not being eliminated through the urinary tract causing RBCs to biologically transform giving birth to “filthy, dirty, platelets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red blood cells do not biologically transform into platelets, much less filthy dirty ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rod Forms  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bacterial forms born out of RBCs and found in the blood when there is latent tissue acidosis which alters the blood pH; due to acidic diet, emotional or physical stress, low nascent oxygen (O1); waste products of bacteria and yeast/ fungus (0). ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are not born out of red blood cells. More fiction and fantasy. The rod forms, like the L forms seen in some slides, are artifacts. The rods are many times larger than any known bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anesthetized WBC”s  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indicates recent consumption of excess sugars/ carbohydrates or proteins; WBCs are paralyzed by the acids (acetyl aldehyde, ethanol alcohol, lactic, nitric, uric, sulfuric, and phosphoric) for up to 5 hours (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White cells cannot be anesthetized, although I can be when reading these sites. The photo to me and others appears to be a normal cell. Of course, if you can diagnosis a normal cell as paralyzed by a dietary lack, then everyone can benefit from supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basophiles&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Perceived to be related to allergies and/or sensitivities to foods or the environment; exotoxic and mycotoxic reactions; histaminea. Alergic reactions to dairy (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way you can diagnose a basophile is by staining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crystals  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Crystals are observed when there is excess acidity. It is the body’s preservation mechanism to buffer acidity and create a solid form which is less toxic than the liquid acids. Crystal are perceived to be he signature of the microzyma fermenting sugar, protein or fat (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making more stuff up. I feel like there should be a midget shouting “Boss, Boss, Da live blood, the live blood” as they only place such physiology exists is on fantasy island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crystals on every live blood site are artifact not of blood, but of schmutz on the slide. One practitioner noted some of the crystals looked like glass, but were in cholesterol. No, it was glass, a by-product of making the slides from glass. Microzyma are not the small empress of Oz, but the imaginary micro organisms of Bechamp and are artifacts of darkfield microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Crystals  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More schmutz/artifact on the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tobacco, marijuana; chemical, recreational and prescription drugs. Brown is also associate with the fermentation of protein (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can imagine some gullible person losing a job because of drug use found on live blood analysis. If companies will use handwriting analysis or, in Japan, blood type as a basis for hiring and firing, live blood analysis will be next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cholesterol  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm"&gt;http://www.betterblood.net/gallery2.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More schmutz on the slide. You cannot see cholesterol on a blood smear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usually indicates high blood pressure, arterial sclerosis, high cholesterol. Diet is too high in animal source proteins. Dehydration, acidosis (0).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the blood pressure usually indicates high blood pressure. It is a simple enough diagnostic procedure and more reliable than looking at live blood. Similarly, a fasting lipid panel may be the more accurate way to diagnosis hypercholesterolemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, virtually every diagnosis in live blood analysis is nonsense and much of the alleged pathology is either normal or artifact on the slide. The alleged pathophysiology is also nonsense; they just make this stuff up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live blood analysts tend to make up words and processes that sound scientific and cromulous (6): several sites refer to seeing orimbryonic bacteria, but the google cannot find a definition. This pseudoscientific jargon and imaginary physiology combined with the a microscope and a view of their own blood, which most people have never seen, gives the live blood analysis proponents the trappings of real science. A nickel says they wear white coats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no validity behind almost all of the claims made by the practitioners. The one study that looked at the ability for blinded live blood analyzers to make the same diagnosis demonstrated that no two viewers saw the same thing (7). The one diagnostic trial of live blood analysis demonstrated that practitioners were unable to accurately diagnose patients with known metastatic cancer (9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the web sites show before and after slides to demonstrate the benefits of the detox or supplements or diet have had on the blood. It all depends on what microscopic field on a given slide you choose to present. If you were to show the front of my scalp as the before and the back as the after, you would conclude that something made my hair grow in the interim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live blood analysis is a remarkable the combination of artifacts being diagnosed as pathology combined with an imaginary pathophysiology that is completely divorced from reality. It is microscopic paradolia, with the practitioners seeing their own imagining in the structures on the slides. When I was a child, before I learned to cursive writing, I would make squiggles on paper occasionally crossing a ‘t’ and dotting an ‘i’. It was gibberish but I called it real writing. I didn’t realize I was in training to be a live blood analyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live blood analysis does not resemble most alternative medicine modalities, but is more akin to high tech reading of tea leaves or the entrails of pig to divine the future. It is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult"&gt;cargo cult&lt;/a&gt; of quackery, with the trappings of science but none of the substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7) Altern Ther Health Med. 2006 Jul-Aug;12(4):36-41. Reliability of Enderlein’s darkfield analysis of live blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONTEXT: In 1925, the German zoologist Günther Enderlein, PhD, published a concept of microbial life cycles. His observations of live blood using darkfield microscopy revealed structures and phenomena that had not yet been described. Although very little research has been conducted to explain the phenomena Dr. Enderlein observed, the diagnostic test is still used in complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBJECTIVE: To test the interobserver reliability and test-retest reliability of 2 experienced darkfield specialists who had undergone comparable training in Enderlein blood analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SETTING: Inpatient clinic for internal medicine and geriatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;METHODS: Both observers assessed 48 capillary blood samples from 24 patients with diabetes. The observers were mutually blind and assessed their findings according to a specific item randomization list that allowed observers to specify whether Enderlein structures were visible or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: The interobserver reliability for the visibility of various structures was kappa = .35 (95% CI: .27-.43), the test-retest reliability was kappa = .44 (95% CI: .36-.53).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study indicates that Enderlein darkfield analysis is very difficult to standardize and that the reliability of the diagnostic test is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND: Dark field microscopy according to Enderlin claims to be able to detect forthcoming or beginning cancer at an early stage through minute abnormalities in the blood. In Germany and the USA, this method is used by an increasing number of physicians and health practitioners (non-medically qualified complementary practitioners), because this easy test seems to give important information about patients’ health status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OBJECTIVE: Can dark field microscopy reliably detect cancer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the course of a prospective study on iridology, blood samples were drawn for dark field microscopy in 110 patients. A health practitioner with several years of training in the field carried out the examination without prior information about the patients. RESULTS: Out of 12 patients with present tumor metastasis as confirmed by radiological methods (CT, MRI or ultra-sound) 3 were correctly identified. Analysis of sensitivity (0.25), specificity (0.64), positive (0.09) and negative (0.85) predictive values revealed unsatisfactory results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCLUSION: Dark field microscopy does not seem to reliably detect the presence of cancer. Clinical use of the method can therefore not be recommended until future studies are conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

The baffled Radio 4 presenter had to repeat back a translation into normal English.  What on earth is the function of this police jargon?  Are we supposed to be comforted or protected by this talk of subjects suffering fatal incidents in residences?  We know that &lt;b&gt;people&lt;/b&gt; often &lt;b&gt;die&lt;/b&gt; when planes crash right into their &lt;b&gt;houses&lt;/b&gt;.  Why does the police style of speaking to the media not allow us to be told about it in such simple terms?  I'm not just pretending to be puzzled here; I truly do not understand this linguistic phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think, if you didn't think very carefully, that Orwell's overheated warnings about bureaucratic jargon (in "Politics and the English language") had some relevance to this.  But Orwell's point was that the authorities have a motivation to talk about "collateral damage" and "incidental civilian casualties".  They are trying to stop us from reacting emotionally to evil things they have done in our name, like killing innocent children by callously dropping bombs where people live.  But the motive is lacking here.  The police didn't crash the Buffalo plane.  They are innocent, and we know that.  Their sad role is to cordon off the street, protect the public from the blaze, and account for each dead body.  What exactly are we being protected from when people in their houses are described murkily as subjects in their residences?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Three federal judges ruled against three families---the Cedillos, the Hazlehursts, and the Snyders---who were seeking compensation from the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/"&gt;National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; (NVICP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026"&gt;decisions&lt;/a&gt; of the three Special Masters &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/node/5026"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?page_id=2"&gt;Steven Novella&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://medicine.yale.edu/"&gt;Yale University Medical School&lt;/a&gt; has a good &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=478#more-478"&gt;summary of the decisions&lt;/a&gt;. He concludes with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decisions reflect the overall impression of the scientific community - the theories behind the notion that vaccines cause autism are speculative and the evidence is strongly against them. Also, the experts who have looked at the evidence and have concluded that vaccines do not cause autism simply know what they are talking about, while the anti-vaccine experts were unimpressive and not persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a solid victory, much as the Dover decision (which thoroughly went through the scientific arguments for evolution and the nonsense of Intelligent Design) was for science and the teaching of evolution.  We can now expect desperate spin from the anti-vaccine crowd. That should be fun (while also depressing) to watch. And, just as with ID, it is unlikely that even this solid trouncing will end anti-vaccine pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say, the inevitable &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ruling_on_vaccine_court_cases_today_aprs_a_le_dluge"&gt;déluge&lt;/a&gt; of news reports, analyses, and blog postings about the court's decision is simply painful.  Painful because, as Kev at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1872"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; wrote, "Three brave families .... were placed in harm's way not by an MMR injection but by a string of bad doctors, worse autism/antivax organisations and really terrible witnesses." These families have put out significant financial resources in the hopes, it seems, of winning their cases and compensation from the NVICP: The Cedillos apparently took a second mortgage out on their home so that they could attend the legal proceedings with Michelle, who requires substantial care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf"&gt;ruling in the Cedillo case&lt;/a&gt;, Special Master George L. Hastings, Jr.----recognizing and indeed admiring the efforts of the families to do their best by their children--wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The record of this case demonstrates plainly that Michelle Cedillo and her family have been  though a tragic and painful ordeal.  I had the opportunity, in the courtroom during the evidentiary hearing, to meet and to observe both of Michelle’s parents, and a number of other family members as well.  I have also studied the records describing Michelle’s medical history, and the efforts of her family in caring for her.  Based upon those experiences, I am deeply impressed by the very loving, caring, and courageous nature of the Cedillo family.  Those family members clearly have done a wonderful job of coping with Michelle’s conditions, and in caring for her with great love.  I admire them greatly for their dedication to Michelle’s welfare. Nor do I doubt that Michelle’s parents and relatives are sincere in their belief that the MMR vaccine played a role in causing Michelle’s devastating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the mere fact that Michelle’s autistic symptoms first became evident to her family during the months after her MMR vaccination might make them wonder about a possible causal connection.  Further, the Cedillos have read about physicians who profess to believe in a causal connection between the MMR vaccine and both autism and chronic gastrointestinal problems.  They have visited at least one physician, Dr. Krigsman, who has explicitly opined that Michelle’s own chronic gastrointestinal symptoms are MMR-caused.  And they have even been told that a medical laboratory has positively identified the presence of the persisting vaccine-strain measles virus in Michelle’s body, years after her vaccination.  &lt;em&gt;After studying the extensive evidence in this case for many months, I am convinced that the reports and advice given to the Cedillos by Dr. Krigsman and some other physicians, advising the Cedillos that there is a causal connection between Michelle’s MMR vaccination and her chronic conditions, have been very wrong.  Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment.  Nevertheless, I can understand why the Cedillos found such reports and advice to be believable under the circumstances. [my emphases]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conclude that the Cedillos filed this Program claim in good faith. Thus, I feel deep sympathy and admiration for the Cedillo family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finger-pointing at science and scientists has already started, and calls for more studies already issued. I see no end to these, and not because more studies, more evidence, "more more more"---it is always more----is needed to prove to the 110th percent that there is no link between vaccines and autism. I see no end to these requests because there's a hunger out there among parents and families with children on the spectrum. There's a gnawing need to know and no science will ever satiate it. Just as there is a need to find a &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/no-magic-pill-for-autism-on-risperdal-and-the-importance-of-autism-education/"&gt;magic pill&lt;/a&gt; for autism, there's a need to identify the what, the thing, the &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; that caused autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that scientists and the medical community can proceed with the care and respect shown by Special Master Hastings. Even while the scientific evidence refuting a vaccine-autism link accrues, that need to know is lodged as firmly as ever in parents. Those who continue to believe in a link between vaccines and autism, in the face of and in despite of the evidence, are well-positioned to present themselves as the mavericks who thumb their nose at the establishment, who go against "the mainstream" and, in the tradition of American individualism, stand up for the little guy and pioneer a new path. When parents write about their feelings at holding down a child so she could get a shot or their fear that something they were told would help a child has possibly hurt her, there's a tug on the feelings, on the heartstrings, that the measured conclusions of the best studies cannot approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine-autism issue is a symptom of the emotions and the realities that parents of autistic children live with every day, and it's this emotional core that not all the peer-reviewed studies, not all the Special Masters' verdict, not all the proverbial tea in China (even if it's being touted as the latest autism treatment) can upstage. And before more resources and energy are expended about this more and more discredited theory of autism causation, those emotions, that need, must be acknowledged, and must be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;

No matter how much we disagree, we can always find a way to inject a little good humor into the dialog. He's smart, he expresses himself clearly, he doesn't seem to take it personally, he keeps his goal in view and he keeps a positive and humorous outlook which, in my view, exemplifies a "good Christian", adds tremendous value to the dialog, and to this blog in general.  In my view RichD is one of the commenters that sets the standard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this comment from my article &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/heuristics-and-when-ones-values-are-out.html"&gt;Heuristics and When Ones Values Are Out Of Sync With Ones Thinking&lt;/a&gt;, he's teasing me by using my name as a suffix.  He's a pleasure to have around and I want to feature one of his comments where (for once) we do agree!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I say that Christians are Agnostic with a Bias for God and RichD seems to agree with me.  He disagreed with a comment that another Christian named Logismous made and was providing a rebuttal to it.  At the end of his comment he asks rhetorically if its not possible for Christians to come to an agreement on the Primary Tenet of Salvation.  See what you think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello Lee, Logismous, I think I'll jump in, and most likely surprise you once again.  I think a key thing that comes up in all of this, and never really takes off, is as follows.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You, Lee, say you were once a Christian and lost your faith, so you obviously understand Christian doctrine. I think we could rule that part out of further discussions, even though I don't recall ever claiming this about you. Logis also claims to understand christian doctrine but not the same as lee, apparently (maybe that's apparentLee).  Logis added [the following bold italicized comment] that should clear everything up &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;If Christians disagree about things, it's not because we're not all listening to the same Holy Spirit, but because we each misunderstand Him in different ways. We actually claim that none of us understands Him well enough.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So obviousLee, no-one knows anything about God. Or did I miss something, because Logis also said she/he knows God because of the spirit that is always misunderstood differently by everyone. There that ought to clear things up.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So in reality we have a bunch of denominations of Christianity because they all have a different misunderstanding of the doctrine of Christ and they form their own groups based on these misunderstandings. Once saved always saved, saved by faith, saved by grace, saved by works, saved by faith and works, and so on. Which is exactLee what Lee, and others, are confused about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can anyone say they understand the doctrine of Christ if all Christendom claims to not understand it "well enough"?   I agree that we don't understand everything about doctrine, but can't we get enough understanding to come to a consensus about the PRIMARY tenant of the gospel, Salvation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you RichD for agreeing with me for once, for constantly keeping me on my toes, and making me smile!  Keep that BS detector calibrated and ever vigilant!  I'll try not to set it off!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It turned out to be part of &lt;a title="Full Insect Place Setting" href="http://www.artnet.com/Galleries/Artwork_Detail.asp?G=&amp;amp;gid=139663&amp;amp;cid=148336&amp;amp;which=&amp;amp;aid=700016&amp;amp;wid=425796636&amp;amp;source=exhibitions&amp;amp;rta=http://www.artnet.com"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cacobeto/3105037089/"&gt;&lt;img title="nifty art" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3148/3105037089_4c747fc0ab.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="297"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It’s apparently from an art show by Regina Silveira:&lt;a href="http://reginasilveira.uol.com.br/mundusadmirabilis.php#"&gt; Mundus Admirus e Outras Pragas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(”&lt;em&gt;Mundus Admirabilis&lt;/em&gt; and other plagues”; &lt;em&gt;Mundus&lt;/em&gt; is Latin for “clean”, but I need help with  &lt;em&gt;Admirabilis&lt;/em&gt;; “wonder” or “admiration doesn’t quite scan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Spanish is…well, terrible, frankly, but as best I can tell from the artist’s web pages, it’s an installation that examines “aspects of conflict and deterioration,” using insects as a metaphor for social and environmental threats to our human future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click on the &lt;a title="the artist&amp;#39;s website" href="http://reginasilveira.uol.com.br/mundusadmirabilis.php#"&gt;“Images” link&lt;/a&gt; you can see that this was a work on a &lt;strong&gt;massive&lt;/strong&gt; scale.  There are additional photos &lt;a href="http://www.britocimino.com.br/exposicoes-presente.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an &lt;a href="http://www.artnet.com/Galleries/Exhibitions.asp?gid=139663&amp;amp;cid=148336"&gt;English language description&lt;/a&gt; of her gallery work–from that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Regina Silveira’s works here deploy visual metaphors - such as images of pests - to foreground aspects of the deterioration and danger involved in the presumed continuity, or re-emergence, of pests or plagues. Present-day versions of mythic pests or plagues become visual fables for contemporary life…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mixed images of pests are stuck to the walls and floor of the entrance and main hall of the gallery. Insects also appear on porcelain objects and a cross-stitch embroidered towel. A large black egg emits the combined sound of mosquitoes and helicopters and a porcelain panel alludes to the rain of frogs.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not particularly a happy use of insects in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really want to know, though, is how did she make these way cool dishes, and can I learn to do that??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you say “sour grapes” in coward? &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/safeminds-response-to-autism-omnibus-court-decision.html#comments"&gt;Safe Minds&lt;/a&gt;. And the excuse they chose was the new prefered excuse of antivaccinationists everywhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The denial of reasonable compensation to families was based on inadequate vaccine safety science available to the court. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the defendant in vaccine injury cases and is also responsible for carrying out the very vaccine safety research that should be integral to court decisions. This conflict of interest means the deck is stacked against families when they enter “vaccine court” and is yet one more reason for parents to doubt the integrity of the National Immunization Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odd that Safe Minds never mentioned this “conflict of interest” before. It’s almost like they never expected to lose and then after such a devastating decision was reached, they were forced to come up with any spin they could think of spur of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell they even quote themselves as experts in their own article. Pretty sneaky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The government has its thumb on the scales of justice,” said Jim Moody, director of SafeMinds and an advisor to the Petitioners Steering Committee of the U.S Federal Court of Claims. “The Vaccine Injury Compensation Act passed by Congress in 1986 gave immunity to vaccine manufacturers and removed the incentive to create safer products. Meanwhile, the law only gives the illusion that parents will have their day in court. The process is dysfunctional and many families will not see justice done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a more–what’s the word I’m searching for? HONEST look at the issue of &lt;a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/HealthCare/wm946.cfm"&gt;vaccine liability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And am I the only one who wonders why Jim Moody’s been so supportive of the Autism Omnibus getting their days in court when, according to him, he was convinced it would only lead to “the illusion that parents will have their day in court?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be that maybe, just maybe, this is merely his lame attempt to dismiss a court decision that not only didn’t go his way, but was an EPIC FAIL for the antivaccination movement possibly as large as the Dover Trial was to the “Intelligent” Design Movement?&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, Deer discovered that Wakefield had been in the pocket of a trial lawyers seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers, having accepted £435,643 in fees, plus £3,910 expenses for his &amp;quot;research.&amp;quot; Who wouldn&amp;#39;t have reported him to the GMC for that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talk about a conflict of interest.  We now know that Olbermann’s piece was essentially written for him by anti-vaccine crank David Kirby, who is &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/keith-olbermann-todays-be_b_166103.html"&gt;crowing about it today on the Huff Post.&lt;/a&gt;  Several people including Brian Deer himself have written to Olbermann today to inform him of his mistake(s), but since there was no retraction from Olbermann tonight we have to conclude that Olbermann is happy with his hatchet job on a respected journalist.  Pretty ironic for someone who criticizes Fox News presenters for reading talking points given to them without checking the facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Vaccines Didn’t Cause Autism&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which brings us to a related story.  Today a special court ruled that evidence presented to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/11/autism.vaccines/index.html?eref=rss_topstories"&gt;did not demonstrate a link between autism and childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a statement shortly after the release of the decisions, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it continues to support research &amp;quot;to better understand the cause of autistic disorders and develop more effective methods of treatment.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, &amp;quot;the medical and scientific communities ... have found no association between vaccines and autism.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is possibly a bigger deal than it may appear. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was set up to compensate anyone who might have been injured by vaccines.  And quite rightly so.  Everyone benefits from a vaccinated population, and so it’s only fair that the very small number of people who are actually injured by vaccines should be compensated by the rest of us.  With this in mind, the Compensation Program was set up to make it easy for anyone injured by vaccines to claim compensation, with minimal legal and financial hurdles to overcome. The result is that the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is very favorable to litigants.  The standard of proof is much lower than it would be in a regular court.  And of course, in a regular court, the standards of evidence are much lower than they would be in the world of science.  So these hearings would have been expected to be very friendly to the litigants.  The fact that even these courts found no link from vaccines to autism is very telling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I predict that Kirby and his merry band will now commence smear tactics on the special masters of the court, and/or anyone else they can blame for this eminently sensible decision.  One thing they will not do, I predict, is reflect that maybe, just possibly, it is just conceivable that they might be wrong about vaccines and autism.  They won’t do that because nothing will ever change their minds.  It’s the vaccines.  It just has to be.  Anyone want to bet I’m wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234502930421"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2157">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2195e30a8470f174</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="Andrew Wakefield"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Brian Deer"/><category term="David Kirby"/><category term="Keith Olbermann"/><category term="vaccines"/><title type="html">Brian Deer’s letter to Keith Olbermann</title><published>2009-02-13T05:23:59Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T05:23:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/brian-deers-letter-to-keith-olbermann/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so in case you haven’t been following, 2 days ago &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/andrew-wakefield-worst-person-in-the-world/"&gt;Keith Olbermann rightly declared Andrew Wakefield “The Worst Person in the World” &lt;/a&gt;due to journalist Brian Deer’s discovery that Wakefield deliberately falsified his data in his famous 1998 study that suggest autism was linked to MMR vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:PMLku0snqpw4wM:http://weblog.signonsandiego.com/weblogs/afb/archives/Keith%252520Olbermann.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:PMLku0snqpw4wM:http://weblog.signonsandiego.com/weblogs/afb/archives/Keith%252520Olbermann.jpg" alt="" width="118" height="88"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then yesterday, Olbermann basically reversed his position after David Kirby and his slimy friends pointed out to Olbermann that Brian Deer’s article happened to be printed in a newspaper owned by Olbermann’s arch nemesis Rupert Murdock. That was apparently all Olbermann needed to turn around and give &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/olbermann-up-one-day-and-down-the-next/"&gt;Brian Deer the Bronze award for “The Worst Person in the World”&lt;/a&gt; without bothering to look at the evidence and see if Deer’s investigation actually had any merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/brian_deer_responds_to_keith_olbermann.php#more"&gt;now Brian Deer has responded to Olbermann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But not just any Darwin Day; it's the Darwin's 200th Birthday Darwin Day. The only major event of which I was aware in the Greater Lafayette area today was a panel called "Evolution: Myths and Misconceptions," wherein three professors fielded questions about evolution. It was sponsored by the Purdue Non-Theists Society and the Purdue Biology Club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went primarily because I was expecting to run into some foaming fundies. Sadly (or maybe not so much), that was, for the most part, not the case. Overall, it was pretty civil. It did highlight for me, however, something that &lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/"&gt;Kazim at The Atheist Experience&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2009/02/case-study-william-lane-craig-vs-bart.html"&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2009/02/yet-another-loaded-debate-topic.html"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-to-manage-atheist-debate.html"&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt;, only more broadly applied. Kazim is talking specifically about debates between atheists and theists about the existence of God and the reliability of scripture and so on, but many of his points apply equally well to the evolution/ID "debate," and I was reminded of his posts often tonight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The panel tonight consisted of three Purdue professors: a physical anthropologist, a biologist, and a third whose discipline I can't recall but I do remember it wasn't directly related to evolution, but her research made heavy use of evolutionary theory. I want to say it was some kind of biomedical research. Anyway, the third professor of an undetermined discipline began things with a brief PowerPoint presentation going over the basics of evolution. She touched on the "fact and theory" idea, one that I'm pretty fond of, but didn't really go into too much depth. Then she showed a five-minute video that gave a brief look at whale evolution as captured in the fossil record.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three then sat at a couple of tables and began fielding questions. The first few questions were clearly prewritten by the moderators (the presidents of the Non-Theists Society and Biology Club), and directly addressed common anti-evolution claims. The answers given were pretty good until they got to the "Does evolution really break the laws of thermodynamics?" question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What followed was a lot of vague "Well, of course it does" from two of the panelists, and it quickly became clear that none of them was terribly comfortable discussing thermodynamics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is completely understandable; they all have their own disciplines and specialties, and I can't expect them to know everything about everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their inability to sufficiently answer one of the oldest and lamest "criticisms" of evolution is what first made me think of Kazim. His posts of late have been about the inadequacies of most scientists when they debate religious apologists because they simply aren't able to effectively deal with their known tactics and bullshit. They frame arguments poorly, concede points they shouldn't, and let all manner of nonsense slip by them because they, while intelligent and educated people, just aren't familiar with what the apologists are pulling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we had here was a panel of intelligent, well-educated people who knew evolution backward and forward, from their own perspectives. What they &lt;i&gt;didn't&lt;/i&gt; know was creationism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This reflects a problem that seems somewhat endemic in the scientific community: many scientists don't see creationism or ID as much of a threat, and so they don't really pay attention to it. Perhaps many people see it as little more than an annoyance; they don't butt heads with creationists or IDers often enough to understand just how precarious a position good science education is often in. Any of those panelists would probably have been completely unable to respond to the Gish Gallop, or more oblique creationist talking points, like Darwin's supposed deathbed conversion, or his supposed racism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, I want to be very clear that I am not saying these professors are stupid. I'm not even saying that they &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; know creationist talking points, necessarily, seeing as their day-to-day functioning probably doesn't involve them very much. What I am saying is that if someone is going to represent the scientific community and light an evolutionary candle in the darkness, they can't &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; know evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing evolution will get you far as an educator. Knowing evolution won't get you so far when you're facing off against creationists who ask questions that don't normally come up in science class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just like Kazim's idea that atheists debating apologists should know the tactics and talking points of their opponents and not just, say, Biblical history or archaeology, people talking about evolution &lt;i&gt;when it is opposed to the various forms of creationism&lt;/i&gt; should know their enemies at least as well as they know themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think for a good example I should expand upon the thermodynamics question. When it was posed by the moderators, it was clearly posed to get someone with authority to break down why that "criticism" is a myth and/or misconception for the people in the cheap seats. That did not happen; instead, people with authority pretty much just said "No, evolution doesn't break those laws." One of the professors did mention that Earth has its own energy source in the sun which allows local entropy to decrease, but it wasn't elucidated clearly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once audience questions began, some rambling crazy guy in the middle of the lecture hall posited something along these lines: "If the big bang happened, and the amount of energy in the universe has remained constant since then, then any decrease in entropy anywhere &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; violate the second law of thermodynamics. It &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt;." He was very adamant about that point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer should have involved the phrases "closed system" and "open system," as well as a brief breakdown of solar degeneration, the entropic increase that allows Earth's level of local entropy to decrease so long as it results in energy pouring out of the sun in our general direction and how none of this means that more energy is being created that hasn't existed from the beginning. It should have called out the questioner for dishonestly conflating "energy" and "entropy." It should have been short, pithy, and to the point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer, instead, was much more general and vague: "Well, as long as entropy decreases somewhere else in the universe, it can rise here." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The questioner replied "But if you can't measure that, then you don't know it, and so evolution breaks the second law of thermodynamics."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can think of a number things wrong with that statement, but given the inadequate answer, it might well have seemed impressive to some of the less skeptically-inclined in the audience. They did something similar to a move Cleanthes pulled in Hume's &lt;i&gt;Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion&lt;/i&gt;. The characters were discussing the problem of evil, and Cleanthes posited that there was no problem because we can't know that there's not more good happening somewhere else in the cosmos to balance out all the evil that we see happening here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is Demea, I believe, who points out the flaw in this argument: we can't know that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; more good going on elsewhere in the universe, and simply positing it does not make it so and thus redeem a deity from either malice or carelessness. If you want to solve the problem of evil in that way, yours is the burden of proof to find and locate the extra good, not simply to assume its existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what I was reminded of when the rambler talked about thermodynamics. Of course, the professors were correct in their claims, but to someone without prior knowledge of the subject matter, it might well have seemed that the questioner scored a point, because they could not adequately respond to his "Well, you can't measure that" assertion. The prof who fielded it simply said "Well, if you can't measure it, then it's not really a scientific question." On that one, I give her the benefit of the doubt, because he was speaking rapidly and with a heavy accent. I only pieced together what he said after thinking about it for a while, and I really don't think she knew what the hell he was saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vagueness of the initial response, however, indicated that they were not familiar with the claim as it relates to evolution and thus couldn't quickly expose it for the nonsense it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second question that reeked of creationist crap was a middle-aged white guy who asked "Can you please tell us about the science of eugenics and explain to me why it's generally considered a bad thing?" I said under my breath "Someone's been watching &lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost certainly the intent of the question was to link evolution with eugenics and to challenge the evil Darwinists to explain why it was wrong, something they &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; couldn't do because evolution &lt;i&gt;obviously&lt;/i&gt; leads to eugenics. There is no other reason I can think of to bring up eugenics, apropos of nothing, at a panel discussion about evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answers to that seemed to also show that they were unfamiliar with the appeal to eugenics as a criticism of evolution. They did respond well, but in no way did the indicate that they had ever really thought of that question in an evolutionary context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final question that reeked of a creationist &lt;i&gt;agent provocateur&lt;/i&gt; was "Has there ever been a documented case of speciation?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a great smackdown moment for the panel, as the biological anthropologist was able to reference a very recent paper she had just read on rodents who live in highway medians who have, in a pretty damn short amount of time, diverged from their former population not twenty yards away on the other side of the highway owing to only a slightly different environment and the selection pressure of not being run over while crossing the highway. That was a good one, but speciation has been documented in laboratory settings since the 1980s in &lt;i&gt;drosophila&lt;/i&gt; studies. Those damn fruit flies sure are useful. It would have been good, probably, to mention that, too, to show that observed speciation is nothing new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, a retort might be "But that's artificial selection in a lab, and not natural selection in nature," at least in the absence of the highway rodent data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to point something out: I can conceive of that retort only because of how familiar I am with creationist debate tactics and argument strategies. I know how they like to misrepresent and nitpick, how they like to shift goalposts and change subjects. Replying like that is a clear shift of subject: the question was about observed speciation, and did not specify whether or not it was a result of natural or artificial processes. Changing the subject to natural vs. artificial selection might very well get a vague non-response from someone unfamiliar with creationist tactics instead of "That's not what you asked. You asked about speciation. Frankly, though, it doesn't matter whether the speciation is due to natural or artificial selection, because in general, creationists deny that macroevolution and speciation happens &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;, and that is clearly falsified by even a lab study. You're being dishonest and I don't appreciate it." One could go into more detail, too, about how some of the &lt;i&gt;drosophila&lt;/i&gt; research attempted to replicate natural selection and was much more organic than plain old breeding or the creation of fly lines with weird Mendelian traits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't want to sound like an arrogant douche, but I myself and most of the average, non-biologist, non-anthropologist skeptics I know could have answered the specifically creationist questions far better than the professors on the panel. I can't emphasize enough how this does not mean that they're stupid or bad scientists or anything at all like that; they're only unfamiliar with creationist talking points and so have not partaken of the tangential, multidisciplinary research necessary to effectively refute them. We've all done this before, though, and despite our general lack of Ph.Ds (I'm sure some of you have them, but I know I surely don't), we'd be better at fielding creationist questions than tonight's panelists because of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What it really comes down to is seeing questions as questions instead of seeing them as specific tactics. When a creationist asks about the second law of thermodynamics, he isn't trying to get an honest answer. He's trying to throw the speaker off-balance and score points with the audience. If all you do is answer his question and you don't call him out on his blatant bullshit, he'll move right along to his next talking point, his next "criticism," his next blunt dart aimed poorly for the balloon of evolution. Honest questions deserve honest answers; tactical questions deserve tactical responses, but you have to be able to tell the difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, to effectively talk about evolution as opposed to creationism or ID, if you're not familiar with creationism or ID, you can have all the real, verified, reliable scientific evidence in the world on your side and still end up looking stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went into the panel wondering if anyone would bring up the "Evolution is a tautology" line that Michael Egnor, in his egnorance, spewed a year or two ago. I don't know how any of the panelists would have answered it, because it is one of the most oblique and esoteric "criticisms" in the ID playbook, but I don't have confidence that it would have been convincing to any fence-sitters in the audience. Not a one of the panelists was a logician or a mathematician. Not a one of them could have talked about why that is true about any true statement, and why it doesn't matter anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if someone had taken Egnor's most recent tactic and conflated evolution with "the faith of materialism?" I really don't think that any of the panelists could have adequately answered that. They're all probably great at what they do and know their own expertises backwards and forwards (and I know from experience that the biological anthropologist on the panel is an excellent teacher), but they don't know (or at least seemed unfamiliar with) the multifaceted attack (lame as it may be) that is the creationist movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of the rest of the questions asked were completely lame: a couple were pseudo-futuristic "Where will we evolve from here?" questions, and more than a couple dealt explicitly with ethics ("Should we do X?"). The panelists explained adequately that those were not questions within their purview as evolutionary scientists to answer; the future evolution questions were simply impossible to know and the ethical questions were not scientific. It was good of them to point this out. It was bad of one of them to say "Well, there are other ways of knowing about the world, and we shouldn't make science more important than it is. It can only know about the small slice of things we can see and measure." Thanks, Carl Sagan; you really instilled in me the wonder and majesty of the cosmos and the perpetual scientific quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait, no, you downplayed the most important, most productive tool in the history of human culture and civilization in an effort to placate folks with their "other ways of knowing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, it was overall not too bad. The questions that I covered in detail were simply the ones that were answered, in my opinion, rather poorly (or were just plain stupid questions). There were plenty of normal questions with good answers, but those few stood out to me because they were examples of the difference between an expert on evolution an an effective combatant in the ongoing war against creationism, and it really put so much of Kazim's recent writing into a real life context for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps the best way to combat myths and misconceptions about evolution is to start at the core and make those closest to the subject matter understand perhaps the most important myth of all: good science and evolutionary education is not safe, and the forces of ignorance &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; a threat, after all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything else is just details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-2279280846340304939?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234501516152"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_death_in_the_family.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/514a2e350f2399d0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">A death in the family</title><published>2009-02-13T05:00:01Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T05:00:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/LVZ54dbRQs0/a_death_in_the_family.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_death_in_the_family.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all of you who have notified me of the decision for the three test cases in the Autism Omnibus hearings before the Vaccine Court. &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/02/12/washington/AP-Autism-Ruling.html"&gt;Science actually won in the courts&lt;/a&gt;, something you just can't count on with any reliability. It even won resoundingly. I also realize that, as much as it still shocks me, a lot of people look forward to what I have to say on this issue, as I've become one of the main "go-to" bloggers on all things vaccine. Normally, I'd be all over this, reading the decision in detail, culling choice quotes, and spreading my special brand of Respectful and not-so-Respectful Insolence far and wide over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, I'm afraid you'll have to wait a while. I'm afraid the blogosphere will have to do without me on this story, even though it's the biggest blow to the antivaccine movement I can recall in four years. I'm just not that interested in blogging right now about anything. However, I do feel an obligation to my readers to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, February 12, 2009, my mother-in-law passed away after a battle with a particularly nasty and rare form of breast cancer. She had been in hospice for about three months, the last week and a half in residential hospice. (I had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/an_open_letter_to_seth_aronson_about_his.php"&gt;alluded to this before&lt;/a&gt;.) The last time I saw her was on Sunday, and I feared that that would be the last time I saw her alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not be blogging for a few days. I don't know if it'll be a couple of days or a couple of weeks before I come back. Because I've had three months to foresee this sad day, however, I did line up some "Classic Insolence" to post automatically at least once a day until until I feel up to producing new material again. I may post an occasional brief update as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, perhaps you, my readers, could share your stories of loss. More importantly, how did you deal with it? I will see your responses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/a_death_in_the_family.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/LVZ54dbRQs0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234501502023"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c033f7ac5d848143</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="frontpage"/><title type="html">The Parade of Errors</title><published>2009-02-13T05:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T05:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/434-the-parade-of-errors.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The state of Virginia boasts one of the most transparent – yet revered – “psychics” of recent decades.  He was known as the "Sleeping Prophet," a photographer named Edgar Cayce who earned his nickname by making medical diagnoses while reclining in a “trance,” though no evidence was ever produced to establish this state, perhaps because experts on the subject are rather rare. Cayce – pronounced “Kay-see” – was the subject of an episode of one of NBC's "Unsolved Mysteries," the TV show that showcased such wonders as the Gulf Breeze UFO photos of Ed Walters, and England's phantom “crop circles,” as genuine wonders. The NBC-TV crew went both to Norfolk and Virginia Beach filming dramatic recreations of Cayce's life for a 15-minute segment which concentrated on Cayce's reputation as a "psychic diagnostician."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa. That’s the Carina nebulosity region, a vast complex of stars, gas, and dust in the southern skies, one of if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; largest star-forming regions in the galaxy. This shows only a piece of it 144 light years across (if it looks familiar, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/04/24/hubbles-17th-chaos-birth-and-near-death/"&gt;Hubble took a similar shot in 2007&lt;/a&gt;). Click the image to get a bigger version, or, if you have the time and bandwidth that could swallow a pineapple whole, try grabbing &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/public/archives/images/phot-05a-09-fullres.tif"&gt;this &lt;strong&gt;134 Mb&lt;/strong&gt; TIFF image&lt;/a&gt;. I’m serious, don’t click that unless you want a seriously big picture. There’s also &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/Videos/Nebulae/EtaCarinaZoom_P_FLASH.flv.html"&gt;a video zoom-in&lt;/a&gt; on the ESO site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot to see here! The bright star at the lower left, grossly overexposed, is &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/06/20/eta-car-tick-tock-tick-tock/"&gt;Eta Carinae&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve written a few thousand words on that beastie, both here and in my book. And you know what that means: one day it’ll blow, and when it does, well, yikes. It’s one of the most luminous and massive stars in the galaxy, and there’s a small but finite chance that it’ll go all gamma-ray burst on us some day. Happily, it’s not aimed at us if it does, but even as a plain old supernova it’s a terrifying object. It’s a binary, and one of the stars must have about &lt;em&gt;100 times the mass of the Sun&lt;/em&gt;, pretty much at the theoretical limit of how massive a star can be without tearing itself apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about black holes, galaxies colliding, and even the eventual fate of the Universe. I tell you this to put in perspective that objectively, &lt;strong&gt;Eta Car scares the crap out of me&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can’t hurt us, so don’t worry about it that way. I just mean that the very fact of its existence fills me with awe and a sort of abject terror. Eta Car is 7500 light years away, but it’s so luminous it’s visible to the naked eye (at that distance, you’d need a pretty good telescope to spot the Sun at all). And that’s when it’s just sitting there being all stable and calm. In the 1840s it had an explosive event that blew out twin lobes of matter, &lt;em&gt;each with about the same mass as the Sun&lt;/em&gt;. This explosion was just shy of a supernova itself, launching all that gas away from the star &lt;strong&gt;at a million miles per hour&lt;/strong&gt;. So think about a single object that can lob 20 octillion tons of gas at that speed, and tell me the Universe isn’t the most awesome thing in the Universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3275937982/in/photostream/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3454/3275937982_766dd3675b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, a keyhole. OK.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to Eta Car is the famous Keyhole Nebula, named such because some astronomer thought it looked like a old-fashioned keyhole. I happen to think there are other things it looks like, but I’m too polite to say just what. And don’t you go shooting your keyboard off in the comments either. This is a PG blog, OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Keyhole is clump of gas and dust being pummeled by the forces of the stars around it, as that whole region is. There are two clusters of stars in the image, too, each with several massive members (though not as hefty as Eta, of course) which blow out huge amounts of material, and also flood the region with high-energy ultraviolet light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the Carina nebulosity is a gorgeous complex, but it’s one of the most dangerous and inhospitable volumes of space in the galaxy. As much as I dream of wandering the Milky Way via warp drive, there are some places I don’t mind viewing from a distance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it's not part of the criteria for any ASD, many people on the spectrum (myself very much in this category) report difficulty processing more than one sensory channel at a time.  Understanding sound and image at the same time is in fact so hard for me that I use closed captioning when I watch movies and television shows--I can process just the visual and let go of any attempt to make sense of the audio.  And believe me, I have much more acute hearing than I'd really like...  When I have to understand what people are saying, even in a quiet setting where I can separate their voices easily from background sounds, I have to "turn off" my vision and all other senses in order to process the word-sounds at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I watched the video, I was not fooled by the illusion.  Perhaps because, even with eyes open,  I was not seeing (in the sense of processing the visual stimulus) the person's mouth move.  Did this happen to anyone else who has "mono-processing" with their senses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If understanding speech is indeed how Rosenblum describes--a multimodal experience--what might that mean in terms of an explanation for why some people on the spectrum have difficulty understanding or keeping up with spoken language?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234489497074"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1138">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/53fc77a94e8a520e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Morphology"/><category term="Semantics"/><category term="Syntax"/><title type="html">Reverberant thinking</title><published>2009-02-13T01:35:49Z</published><updated>2009-02-13T01:35:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1138" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;MSNBC headline: "&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29167346/"&gt;Songbirds migrate faster than thought&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other thought-related news, Alec Marantz gave an interesting talk this afternoon at Penn on "Resultatives and re-resultatives", and during the question period, there was some discussion of the fact that none of the things that you can re-think (views, positions, etc.) can actually be thought in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let's pick a few examples at random from today's news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We may need to rethink our way of dealing with this problem.&lt;br&gt;
…the weekend&amp;#39;s fires &amp;quot;show that many communities need to rethink the notion of who lives in a bushfire zone …&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
Mr Bush said any plan to rethink financial mechanisms should &amp;quot;preserve the foundations of democratic capitalism&amp;quot; …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these work without the &lt;em&gt;re-&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;*We may need to think our way of dealing with this problem.&lt;br&gt;
*…the weekend&amp;#39;s fires &amp;quot;show that many communities need to think the notion of who lives in a bushfire zone …&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
*Mr Bush said any plan to think financial mechanisms should &amp;quot;preserve the foundations of democratic capitalism&amp;quot; …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a moment's thought, I wasn't able to come up with any other verbs with this property, that you can re-VERB things that you can't VERB in the first place. But I bet that there are some out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: I'm happy to see people having fun in the comments section, but I'm afraid that I didn't express myself very clearly. What I found interesting about "re-think" is that it's a case of re+VERB where the VERB exists as a free form, apparently the same word with the same basic meaning as in the re+VERB combination, but where you can talk about re+VERB-ing something that you can't felicitously talk about VERB-ing in the first place. Thus all the examples like remark, remind, retire, reneg, research, remunerate, etc., etc., are entirely irrelevant.  Likewise the discussion of cran-morphs and other sorts of bound morphemes. "Re-live" is more like it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the OED's early examples involve re-thinking things that can be thought, often explicitly - especially, of course, the intransitive cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1748&lt;/strong&gt; RICHARDSON &lt;em&gt;Clarissa&lt;/em&gt; (1811) VII. 27 Think, my dear, and re-think.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1808 &lt;/strong&gt;JANE AUSTEN&lt;em&gt; Lett. &lt;/em&gt;(1884) I. 372, I cannot help thinking and re-thinking of your going to the island so heroically.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1853&lt;/strong&gt; LYNCH &lt;em&gt;Self-Improv.&lt;/em&gt; vi. 148 You must think and observe; re-think and re-observe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the same is true for some more recent uses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a1942&lt;/strong&gt; B. MALINOWSKI &lt;em&gt;Sci. Theory of Culture&lt;/em&gt; (1944) iii. 19 At times the thinker does nothing else but to re-think..what the primitive might have or ought to have thought or felt under certain conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some examples certainly do involve re-thinking the (now) unthinkable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a1700&lt;/strong&gt; KEN Edmund Poet. &lt;em&gt;Wks.&lt;/em&gt; 1721 II. 163 All the pass'd Song distinctly he re-thought.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1957&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Times Lit. Suppl. &lt;/em&gt;6 Dec. 729/2 A summons, in effect, to the younger German historians, which only a few of them have heeded, to rethink the whole of Germany's recent past.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1973&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Daily Tel.&lt;/em&gt; 28 Sept. 7/1 Mrs Thatcher last night promised to rethink methods of awarding grants to married women students.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1977&lt;/strong&gt; F. YOUNG in J. Hick&lt;em&gt; Myth of God Incarnate&lt;/em&gt; ii. 30 In any attempt to rethink christological belief, the primacy of soteriology must be recognized.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is true in some cases where the thinking part is explicit as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1719 &lt;/strong&gt;E. BAYNARD &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt; (1731) 2 To think, and re-think each Design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; itself had a now-obsolete use with direct objects, meaning "To meditate on, turn over in the mind, ponder over, consider":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13..&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cursor M.&lt;/em&gt; 24064 (Cott.), I thinc it euer and ai.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1382&lt;/strong&gt; WYCLIF &lt;em&gt;1 Tim.&lt;/em&gt; iv. 15 Thenk thou thes thingis.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1486&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bk. St. Albans&lt;/em&gt; eijb, Thynke what I say my sonne nyght and day.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1605&lt;/strong&gt; SHAKES. &lt;em&gt;Macb.&lt;/em&gt; II. ii. 33 These deeds must not be thought After these wayes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A residue of this remains in the cases with indirect question complements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1881&lt;/strong&gt; TROLLOPE &lt;em&gt;Dr. Wortle's School&lt;/em&gt; V. iv, Mrs. Wortle began to think whether the visitor could have known of her intended absence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, perhaps, another residue is the re-thinking of things that can't now be thought in the first place.]&lt;/p&gt;

Tecumseh Fitch&lt;/a&gt;, on the Occasion of Charles Darwin's 200th Birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin's "Origin of Species" (Darwin, 1859) made little mention of human evolution.  This initial avoidance of human evolution was no oversight, but rather a carefully calculated move: Darwin was well aware of the widespread resistance his theory would meet from scientists, clergymen, and the lay public, and mention of human evolution might have generated insuperable opposition.  But Darwin's many opponents quickly seized on the human mind, and language in particular, as a potent weapon in the battle against Darwin's new way of thinking. Alfred Wallace, whose independent discovery of the principle of natural selection spurred Darwin into finally publishing his long-developing "outline" of the theory in 1859, didn't help by arguing that natural selection was unable to explain the origins of the human mind.  Although Wallace had reservations about all evolutionary approaches to the mind, human language provided the most powerful argument, due to the respectable position of linguistics and philology in Victorian science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin&amp;#39;s most formidable foe on the linguistic front was Friederich Max Müller, professor of linguistics at Oxford University, a very well-known and well-respected scholar  (Stam, 1976).  In his &amp;quot;Lectures on the science of language,&amp;quot; delivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1861, and rapidly published thereafter (Müller, 1861), Müller launched a full frontal attack on Darwin and Darwinism, using his credentials in the &amp;quot;science of language&amp;quot; as a powerful bludgeon. Müller&amp;#39;s position was uncomplicated: &amp;quot;language is the Rubicon which divides man from beast, and no animal will ever cross it … the science of language will yet enable us to withstand the extreme theories of the Darwinians, and to draw a hard and fast line between man and brute.&amp;quot; For Müller, &amp;quot;Language&amp;quot; was the key feature distinguishing humans from all animals.  Müller&amp;#39;s arguments were seen by many as convincing: his student Noiré dubbed him &amp;quot;the Darwin of the mind&amp;quot; and considered Müller to be &amp;quot;the only equal, not to say superior, antagonist, who has entered the arena against Darwin&amp;quot; (p. 73,Noiré, 1917).  Müller&amp;#39;s argument about the unbridgeable, qualitative difference between human language and all forms of animal communication, combined with Wallace&amp;#39;s opinions, provided arguments that Darwin by necessity took very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when Darwin finally broached the subject of human evolution in 1871, in his second great book &amp;quot;The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex,&amp;quot; the need to provide a credible explanation of language evolution was a central concern.  Darwin rose to the challenge: his &amp;quot;musical protolanguage&amp;quot; model represents a powerful marriage of comparative data, evolutionary insight, and a biological perspective on language. Darwin&amp;#39;s view of language was ahead of its time, and his model and arguments remain surprisingly relevant to contemporary debates.  He clearly adopted a &amp;quot;multicomponent&amp;quot; view of language, one that recognized the necessity of several distinct mechanisms to produce the complex product that we now call language, rather than privileging any one factor as the single &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; to Language in a monolithic sense.  Among these several components, he presciently recognized the necessity for complex vocal learning, and recognized that this biological capacity, while unusual among mammals, is shared with many birds.  The importance of vocal learning has often been forgotten, but also frequently reaffirmed by later scholars (Egnor &amp;amp; Hauser, 2004; Fitch, 2000; Janik &amp;amp; Slater, 1997; Marler, 1976; Nottebohm, 1976).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin also adopted an empirical, data-driven approach to the problem at hand.  In particular, Darwin exploited a wide comparative database, exploiting not just his knowledge of nonhuman primate behaviour, but also insights from many other vertebrates.  Finally, and most characteristically, he resisted any special pleading about human evolution.  He intended his model of human evolution to fit within, and remain consistent with, a broader theory of evolution that applies to beetles, flowers and birds.  Unlike Wallace, who remained a human exceptionalist to his death (Wallace, 1905), Darwin aimed to uncover general principles, like sexual selection and shifts of function, to provide explanations of unusual or unique human traits.  While gradualistic, his model does not assume any simple continuity of function between nonhuman primate calls and language, and he clearly recognized the uniqueness of language in our species.  In many ways, then, Darwin's model of language evolution finds a natural place in the landscape of contemporary debate concerning language evolution, and it is surprising that his model has received relatively little detailed consideration in the modern literature (for exceptions see Donald, 1991; Fitch, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this essay, I aim to redress this neglect by considering Darwin's model of language evolution in detail.  After discussing Darwin's main points and arguments, I will briefly review additional data supporting Darwin's model that has appeared since his death.  I will also discuss the issue of meaning, about which Darwin had too little to say, but which can be resolved by the addition of a hypothesis due to (Jespersen, 1922).  My conclusion is that, suitably modified in the light of contemporary understanding, Darwin's model of language evolution, based on a "protolanguage" more musical than linguistic, provides one of the most convincing frameworks available for understanding language evolution. The timing of my writing, on the 150th anniversary of the Origin, and the 200th of Darwin's birth, is also appropriate for a revival of interest in Darwin's compelling and well-supported hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language as an "Instinct to Learn"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter Two of the &lt;em&gt;Descent of Man&lt;/em&gt;, entitled "Comparison of the mental powers of man and the lower animals" is one of the most remarkable in the entire Darwinian corpus, noteworthy for its concision and its breadth of argument, in considering the evolution of the human mind. The first half of the chapter lays the groundwork of modern research in comparative cognition, arguing that animals have emotions, attention, memory  as well as many other mental traits in common with humans.  However, Darwin's opponents, notably Müller, had already ceded the point that animals have memory, experience emotions, and so on.  Language was the key issue, and one can imagine considerable anticipation of both pro- and anti-Darwinian readers as they turned to the section simply titled "Language".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ten densely-argued pages, Darwin considers some theoretical preliminaries, and then lays out his theory of language evolution.  The first stage involved a general increase in intelligence and complex mental abilities, and the second involves a sexually-selected attainment of the specific capacity for complex vocal control: singing.  The third stage was the addition of meaning to the "songs" of the second stage, which was both driven by, and in turn fueled, further increases in intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, Darwin makes a number of important observations. First, he recognizes the crucial distinction between the language faculty (the biological capacity which enables humans to acquire language) and particular languages (like Latin or English).  The former capacity, which Darwin refers to as "an instinctive tendency to acquire an art"  (p 56), is shared by all members of the human species.  Darwin neatly bypasses the unproductive nature/nurture debate that has consumed so much scholarly energy by observing that language "is not a true instinct, as every language has to be learnt.  It differs, however, from all ordinary arts, for man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children" (p 55).  As ethologist Peter Marler has put it, language is not an instinct, but an "instinct to learn" whose expression entails that both biological and environmental preconditions be fulfilled. It is this "instinct to learn" for which an biological, evolutionary explanation must be sought: a thoroughly modern perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, although he was well-aware of the peculiarities of the human vocal tract, Darwin argues that the human capacity for language must be sought in the brain, rather than the peripheral vocal tract.  He acknowledges that "articulate speech" (by which he means vocalization augmented by controlled movement of the lips and tongue, p. 59) is "peculiar to man", but he denies that this mere power of articulation suffices to distinguish human language "for as every one knows, parrots can talk."  Instead, Darwin states that it is not speech, but humans' "large power of connecting definite sounds with definite ideas" that is definitive of language, and that this capacity "obviously depends on the development of the mental faculties" (p. 54). By locating the language capacity in the human brain, Darwin's viewpoint is again thoroughly modern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Darwin recognized the relevance to language evolution of birdsong, which he considered the &amp;quot;nearest analogy to language&amp;quot;.  Like humans, birds have fully instinctive calls, and an instinct to sing.  But the songs themselves are learned.  He recognized the parallel between infant babbling and songbird &amp;quot;subsong&amp;quot;, and recognized the key fact that cultural transmission ensures the formation of regional dialects in both birdsong and speech.  Finally, he recognizes that physiology is not enough for learned song: crows have a syrinx as complex as a nightingale&amp;#39;s but use it only in unmusical croaking.  All of these parallels have been amply confirmed, and further explored, by modern researchers (Doupe &amp;amp; Kuhl, 1999; Marler, 1970; Nottebohm, 1972, 1975).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darwin's "Musical Protolanguage" Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin's model of the phylogenesis of the language faculty, like most models today, posits that different aspects of language were acquired sequentially, in a particular order, and under the influence of distinguishable selection pressures. The hypothetical systems characterized by each addition can be termed, following (Bickerton, 1990; Hewes, 1973) "protolanguages".  Darwin's first hypothetical stage in the procession from an ape-like ancestor to modern humans was a greater development of proto-human cognition: "The mental powers in some early progenitor of man must have been more highly developed than in any existing ape, before even the most imperfect form of speech could have come into use" (p 57).  He elsewhere suggests that both social and technological factors may have driven this increase in cognitive power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Darwin outlines the crucial second step: what I have dubbed "musical protolanguage" (Fitch, 2006).  Having noted multiple similarities with birdsong, he argues that the evolution of a key aspect of spoken language, vocal imitation, was driven by sexual selection, and used largely "in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing".  He suggests that this musical proto-language would have been used  in both courtship and territoriality (as a "challenge to rivals"), as well as in the expression of emotions like love, jealousy, and triumph. Darwin concludes "from a widely-spread analogy" (amply documented with comparative data later in the book) that sexual selection played a crucial role driving this stage of language evolution, in particular suggesting that the capacity to imitate vocally evolved analogously in humans and songbirds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial remaining question is how emotionally-expressive musical proto-language made the transition to true meaningful language — how, in Humboldt&amp;#39;s words, humans became &amp;quot;a singing creature, only associating thoughts with the tones&amp;quot; (p. 76von Humboldt, 1836).  This leap, from non-propositional song to propositionally-meaningful speech, remains the greatest explanatory challenge for all musical protolanguage theories (cf. Mithen, 2005). Darwin, citing the previous writings of Müller and (Farrar, 1870), suggests that articulate language &amp;quot;owes its origins to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man&amp;#39;s own instinctive cries&amp;quot;.  Darwin thus embraces all three of the major leading theories of word origins of his contemporaries (cf. Fitch, in press).  Once proto-humans had the capacity to imitate vocally, and to combine such signals with meanings, virtually any source of word forms and meanings would suffice, including onomatopoeia (an imitated roar for &amp;quot;lion&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;whoosh&amp;quot; for wind), and controlled imitation of human emotional vocalizations (mock laughter for &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot;).  The attachment of specific and flexible meanings to vocalizations required only that &amp;quot;some unusually wise ape-like animal should have thought of imitating the growl of a beast of prey … And this would have been a first step in the formation of a language&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin does not suggest that the evolutionary process would stop with the initial acquisition of meaning.  For "as the voice was used more and more, the vocal organs would have been strengthened and perfected".  Additionally, language would have "reacted on the mind by enabling and encouraging it to carry on long trains of thought" which "can no more be carried on without the aid of words, whether spoken or silent, than a long calculation without the use of figures or algebra".  Thus began the interactive evolutionary spiral that led to modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signalling Modality: Vocalization or Gesture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin also explicitly acknowledged the role of gesture in conveying meaning, echoing Condillac&amp;#39;s earlier arguments (Condillac, 1971 (1747)) and presaging contemporary discussions (Arbib, 2005; Corballis, 2003; Hewes, 1973; Stokoe, 1974; Tomasello &amp;amp; Call, 2007).  Darwin was aware of the power of signed language: he reminds us that using his fingers &amp;quot;a person with practice can report to a deaf man every word of a speech rapidly delivered at a public meeting&amp;quot; (p 58).  He also acknowledged the value of gesture in conveying meaning, and allowed that vocal communication would have been &amp;quot;aided by signs and gestures&amp;quot; (p. 56).  Nevertheless, he argues against gestural theorists, because the pre-existence in all mammals of &amp;quot;vocal organs, constructed on the same general plan as ours&amp;quot; would lead any further development of communication to target the vocal organs rather than the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin clearly believes that the power of speech is neural, not peripheral, citing the early aphasia literature as a demonstration of "the intimate connection between the brain, as it is now developed in us, and the faculty of speech".  Comparing the vocal organs and brain, he concludes "that the development of the brain has no doubt been far more important".   And although he uses a continuity argument to support the early and sustained role of speech, he firmly acknowledges the abrupt modern &lt;em&gt;discontinuity&lt;/em&gt; in the linguistic system that has thus evolved.  Thus, like many other insightful commentators (e.g., Donald, 1991; Hockett &amp;amp; Ascher, 1964), Darwin recognized that posing phylogenetic continuity and modern discontinuity as in any way opposed is to create a false dichotomy.  The tree-like nature of phylogeny guarantees that both are core parts of the evolutionary process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darwin Redux: Modern Comparative Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarizing, Darwin suggested that the first step on the road to human language was a general increase in intelligence in the hominid lineage.  In a typically pluralistic fashion, he recognized both &amp;quot;social intelligence&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Machiavellian intelligence&amp;quot; in the modern trope (Byrne &amp;amp; Whiten, 1988)) and technological/ecological intelligence (e.g. for tool use) as playing important selective roles.  Given our modern understanding of hominid evolution, this first stage might be provisionally linked to the genus &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; or perhaps early &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stage is the least intuitive: that before vocalizations were used meaningfully they were used, so to speak, aesthetically, to fulfil many of the same functions that modern humans use music today (courtship, bonding, territorial advertisement and defense, competitive displays, etc.).  This idea that complex vocalizations (and thus some aspects of phonology and syntax) might have preceded the ability of speech to convey propositions and distinct meanings is the most challenging aspect of Darwin&amp;#39;s model.  But Darwin uses the comparative database, and particularly detailed analogy between learned bird song and human song and speech, to show that this step is not just plausible but well-documented: it has occurred in many other species.  Indeed, modern data shows that vocal learning, without propositional meaning, has evolved independently in at least three other clades of mammals (cetaceans, pinnipeds and bats) and three clades of birds (parrots, hummingbirds and oscine songbirds) (Janik &amp;amp; Slater, 1997; Jarvis, 2004).  Such convergent evolution, or repeated independent evolutionary developments of a comparable ability, provides our strongest empirical basis for estimating the likelihood of a particular type of evolutionary event (Harvey &amp;amp; Pagel, 1991).  Many of the chapters in this book affirm, and extend, the observations of parallels between language learning and birdsong that Darwin offered in 1871.  Thus, whether intuitive or not, Darwin&amp;#39;s focus on, and hypothesis for, the evolution of vocal learning is consistent with a wealth of evolutionary and comparative data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulties with Darwin's Model: Evolving Phrasal Semantics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"How did man become, as Humboldt somewhere defined him, 'a singing creature, only associating thoughts with the tones'?" &lt;/em&gt;Otto Jespersen 1922 (p. 437)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its many virtues, there remain some important problems with Darwin&amp;#39;s model that have impeded its acceptance today.  The first and most important is his explanation of the addition of meaning.  Darwin&amp;#39;s explanation, as typical for his day, was concerned only with word meanings (what today would be termed &amp;quot;lexical semantics&amp;quot;).  But from the viewpoint of modern linguistics, his model seems wholly inadequate to deal with large swaths of semantics, particularly those aspects tied in with the interpretation of whole phrases and sentences (&amp;quot;phrasal semantics&amp;quot;).  Modern formal semantics has developed rigorous models of this aspect of linguistic meaning (Dowty, Wall, &amp;amp; Peters, 1981; Guttenplan, 1986; Montague, 1974; Portner, 2005), and it is far more complex and difficult to explain than lexical semantics.  Although one can hardly blame Darwin for not foreseeing these relatively recent developments in linguistics, they nonetheless raise substantial difficulties for his model.  For much of the syntactic &amp;quot;glue&amp;quot; which binds sentences together into large, meaningful wholes (function words, inflection, bound morphemes, word order, and a host of others) cannot be understood as resulting from onamatopoeia or imitation of emotional expressions.  Nor can they be readily understood as &amp;quot;inventions&amp;quot; of some uniquely intelligent individual: all evidence suggests that these indispensable linguistic tools develop reliably in individuals of normal intelligence (Bickerton, 1981; Kegl, 2002; Mufwene, 2001; Mühlhäusler, 1997; Senghas, Kita, &amp;amp; Özyürek, 2005).  This key aspect of language thus seems to have a biological basis.  Darwin does recognize the phenomenon today called &amp;quot;grammaticalization&amp;quot;: he states that &amp;quot;conjugations, declensions, &amp;amp;c., originally existed as distinct words, since joined together&amp;quot; (p 61).  But he offers no model for the origin of these distinct words, and it is hard to see how onamotopoeia or similar processes could have generated this original syntactic and semantic &amp;quot;glue&amp;quot;.  Thus, complex phrasal semantics remains unexplained by Darwin&amp;#39;s model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this oversight was remedied long ago by the linguist Otto Jespersen (Jespersen, 1922). Jespersen&amp;#39;s basic insight involves recognizing the link, in humans, between musical and linguistic phrases, and working conceptually backward from there.  Jespersen suggested a form of protolanguage in which, initially, whole propositional meanings attached to entire sung phrases, but where there was no consistent link between the individual conceptual components of the meaning, and component parts of the musical phrases (syllables and notes).  Thus, there were no &amp;quot;words&amp;quot; as we now understand them.  From this &amp;quot;holistic&amp;quot; starting point, Jespersen argued that a cognitive process of analysis started, which slowly isolated individual chunks of the musical phrase (syllables, or multi-syllabic &amp;quot;phraselets&amp;quot; — what today we call &amp;quot;words&amp;quot;) and associated them with individual components of the meaning (e.g. nouns, verbs and adjectives, whose precursors were already present in the conceptual systems of our pre-linguistic ancestors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jespersen's hypothesis of a "holistic protolanguage" has recently been rediscovered and championed by linguist Alison Wray (Wray, 1998, 2000) and neuroscientist Michael Arbib (Arbib, 2005).  Both cite considerable additional evidence supporting this "analytic" model, including data from modern adult language, child language acquisition, and cognitive neuroscience.  Supporters of the more intuitive "synthetic" model of protolanguage, in which words evolved first followed by syntactic operations for combining them (e.g., Bickerton, 1990), have subjected holistic models to extensive criticisms (Bickerton, 2007; Tallerman, 2007, 2008).  However, I argue that most of these critiques miss their mark if the notion of a musical protolanguage is accepted as a starting point (cf. Fitch, in press).  Jespersen/Wray's model of holistic protolanguage thus dovetails nicely with the musical protolanguage hypothesis, in ways that I believe resolve many, if not all, of these criticisms (cf. Fitch, 2006; Mithen, 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Selection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second problem with Darwin&amp;#39;s model remains unresolved at present: his focus on sexual selection as the force driving the evolution of musical protolanguage.  Appearing as it did as a few pages of an extensive tome introducing and then extensively documenting the very idea of sexual selection, this aspect of Darwin&amp;#39;s theory has the virtue of explaining a core aspect of human evolution using a broad principle abundantly demonstrated in the evolution of other species.  As throughout his work, Darwin eschewed &amp;quot;special pleading&amp;quot; for our own species.  The central difficulty for this beautiful hypothesis is posed by two ugly facts about modern human language: it is equally developed in males and females, and is expressed very early in ontogeny, essentially at birth (Fitch, 2005a). These aspects of language differentiate it sharply from most sexually-selected traits, which are strongly biased to develop in the more competitive sex (typically males), and only at sexual maturity.  If anything, human females have superior language skills when compared to men (Henton, 1992; Kimura, 1983; Maccoby &amp;amp; Jacklin, 1974), and language is remarkable in its very early development, with at least some early tuning to phonology already occurring in utero before birth (DeCasper &amp;amp; Fifer, 1980; Mehler et al., 1988; Spence &amp;amp; Freeman, 1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several potential answers to the difficulty that these facts pose: one is to argue that during the musical protolanguage stage, sexual selection was the driving force, and song was (as in most bird species) expressed mainly in males at sexual maturity.  Then, at a later stage (presumably during the evolution of meaningful language) some other selective force kicked in, so that language became equally (or better) expressed in females, and was pushed to develop early.  A candidate selective force is kin communication: that selection for information transmission between parents and their offspring, or more generally between adults and their younger kin.  I have suggested that kin selection drove this second stage of the evolution of propositional semantic content (Fitch, 2004, 2007). For an exploration and critique of this idea, see (Zawidzki, 2006).  This kin-selection scenario neatly explains the early ontogenetic appearance of language in infants (the earlier offspring begin absorbing their elders' knowledge, the better), and its bias towards females (who are primary caregivers in all hominoids).  The continued presence of meaningful speech in males is easily explained by the dual facts that immature males must also learn, and that, unusually in humans, adult males play an important role in child rearing (whether the father, or male siblings of the mother, is irrelevant to this fact).  Finally, this kin-selection model has the virtue of explaining why language evolved in humans and not in other "musical" lineages.  Humans combine an extended childhood, with ample time to acquire knowledge, with very small reproductive output.  The fact that ape babies are born singly, and rarely, conspire to make the survival of each individual hominid infant a crucial component of reproductive success in the great ape lineage (cf. Fitch, 2007; Hrdy, 1999, 2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative possibility is that sexual selection was, and remains, an important driving force in human cognitive evolution, including language (Miller, 2001), but that human pair-bonding has "changed the rules" in significant ways, so that both sexes are choosy, and both compete for high-quality mates.  Some comparative data can be cited in support of this second option.  Recent data shows that female bird song is not so uncommon as thought by Darwin, who considered female song to be a simple aberration (Langmore, 2000; Riebel, 2003; Ritchison, 1986). There is some evidence suggesting that sexual selection can indeed drive female bird song, though it seems clear that female song is a secondary derivation of male song in most lineages (Langmore, 1996).  While these observations provide some support for the idea that the dual-sex expression of human language could result from sexual selection, it is important to recognize that female song still appears to be numerically speaking exceptional and that any model based on sexual selection will have difficulty explaining the extremely early development, and productive use, of language in human infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final possibility is that sexual selection never played a role in the evolution of music or of language.  The popular notion that music evolved for courtship (Miller, 2000, 2001) stands on a surprisingly weak empirical footing compared to a less obvious, but better-documented function of music: mother-infant communication (Trainor, 1996; Trehub, 2003a, 2003b).  Mothers sing to their infants all over the world, even those who claim to be unable to sing (Street, Young, Tafuri, &amp;amp; Ilari, 2003), and infants both prefer song to speech, and respond to song in manifestly adaptive ways (e.g. engaging with and getting excited by play songs, and being lulled to sleep by lullabies (Trehub &amp;amp; Trainor, 1998).  These observations suggest that music originally functioned in a childcare context, as it continues to do today.  By this model, the use of music in bonding among adults is simply a side-effect of this central function, and its occasional use in courtship is a red herring (Dissanayake, 2000; Falk, 2004; Trehub &amp;amp; Trainor, 1998).  This final possibility is clearly compatible with the kin-selection arguments advanced above, but here there would be no intervening stage of language evolution in which sexual selection ever played a dominating role.  Even Darwin was occasionally wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminological Niceties:  Musical or Prosodic Protolanguage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final, less crucial difficulty with Darwin's model is terminological.  Darwin himself seemed to conceive of his pre-semantic protolangage in terms directly comparable to modern day music (or at least he provides no indication that this is not the case).  He concludes that "musical notes and rhythm" were present in this protolanguage, and that they were deployed  "in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing." This is why I term his model "musical protolanguage".  However, modern human music consists not just of song, but also instrumental music, so this appellation might immediately have connotations of drumming, whistling or flutes that are not, strictly speaking, relevant to language evolution.  More pertinently, if we take the musical protolanguage model seriously, we must acknowledge that modern music may not necessarily preserve the state of this protolanguage precisely, and that both music and language have changed in the interim (cf. Brown, 2000).  That is, Darwin's hypothetical communication system was proto-music, not music per se.  Adopting the logic of comparative reconstruction, we can then ask which aspects of modern speech, and of song, are shared, and thereby reconstruct this system (Fitch, 2005b).  The central shared aspects are prosodic and phonological: the use of a set of primitives (syllables) to produce larger, hierarchically-structured units (phrases) which are discretely distinctive.  But two key "musical" aspects are not shared between speech and song: namely discrete-pitched notes, and temporal isochrony (a steady beat).  I have used this comparison of modern speech and song to argue for a subtly different model from that of Darwin, which I termed "prosodic" rather than "musical" protolanguage, in which protolanguage consisted of sung syllables, but not of notes that could be arranged in a scale, nor produced with a steady rhythm (Fitch, 2006).  This prosodic protolanguage model thus includes the "sung cadence" aspect of Darwin's model, while rejecting both his "notes" and "rhythm" (at least as normally construed).  Both of these aspects of (most) modern song are, by hypothesis, more recent developments in music not present in protolanguage.  I see this as an adjustment of Darwin's hypothesis, fully in keeping with its spirit.  Furthermore, it is unclear from his writings whether Darwin would have disagreed with this adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A different reconstruction of the common ancestor of music and language, involving both discrete pitches and isochronic rhythm (as well as tone-based meaning) is given in (Brown, 2000).  Brown also argues that his hypothetical protolanguage, which he dubs "musilanguage" could not have evolved by normal neo-Darwinian selection and thus demands a group selection explanation.  This remains its clearest, and most dubious, distinction from what is otherwise just a rediscovery of Darwin's basic hypothesis (for critiques see Botha, 2008; Fitch, in press).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have argued that Darwin's model for language evolution, "musical protolanguage," suitably updated, provides a compelling fit to both the phenomenology of modern music and language, and to a wealth of comparative data.  By placing vocal control at the centre of his model, Darwin availed himself of the rich comparative database of other species who have independently evolved complex vocal imitation, and he thus explains two of the features of human language that set if off most sharply from nonhuman primate communication systems: vocal learning and cultural transmission.  The biggest missing piece in Darwin's model, as I see it, is a reasonable explanation of phrasal semantics (and the aspects of syntax that go with it), but this gap was filled by Jespersen by 1922.  Together, these hypotheses provide one of the leading models of language evolution available today (for an enthusiastic book-length exploration seeMithen, 2005), and one that has been repeatedly re-discovered by later scholars (e.g., Brown, 2000; Livingstone, 1973; Richman, 1993).  While many aspects of what has now become a family of models remain to be explored empirically (the issues surrounding sexual, kin and group-selection remain particularly unclear), this is a model worthy of detailed consideration and elaboration today. Most importantly, Darwin's model makes numerous testable empirical predictions (for example about the partially overlapping nature of the brain mechanisms underlying music and spoken language, and their genetic basis) that can be answered in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year of Charles Darwin's 200th birthday seems an opportune time for Darwin' own model of language evolution to regain the prominence it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are telling me that the French and UK versions of Google are highlighted today with the image above, a picture of Charles Darwin's tangled bank, but that the US has snubbed the man. I think they're wrong; I just looked, and &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; have the above image. I can think of a few explanations: google just updated the logo a little later for our time zone, users may have been seeing a cached version of a frequently used page, or the explanation I prefer, I'm special and google takes care to present &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; with a special personal version of the page so that I don&amp;#39;t get mad at them. Admittedly, the last possibility is a tiny bit unlikely, but hey, if I&amp;#39;m not going to believe in a deity, maybe I can believe in a loving, omnipotent search engine.

If you prefer your classics in modern Web 2.0 form, check out John Whitfield’s &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bloggingtheorigin"&gt;Blogging the Origin&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/mar/04-discover-does-darwin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt;’s own special coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin Day has a different tenor than Newton Day or Einstein Day would have.  The theory of natural selection has an impact on our self-image as human beings in a way that classical mechanics or relativity simply do not.  Every great scientist teaches us something about how the world works, but evolution also teaches us something about who we are.  (Or, more accurately, is an important part of a wide-ranging set of ideas that teach us something about who we are.)  Namely, that we human beings are not separate from the world.  We are part of it, subject to the same laws, originating from the same processes, not singled out for some special purpose among the multitude of amazing events within our far-flung universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad for Darwin.  It’s nearly impossible to recognize and appreciate his scientific genius without also grappling one way or another with the sad reality that so many people are reluctant to accept the truth of natural selection.  We are messy biological creatures, not perfect reasoning machines, and it’s too tempting to view the workings of the world through a lens of our personal preferences.  (Ironically, the reason why we are messy biological creatures rather than perfect reasoning machines is that we got to where we are through an unpredictable and historically contingent set of evolutionary steps, rather than being designed from scratch.)  We want to be special, we don’t want to be an accident, and in the face of overwhelming evidence we too often simply refuse to accept any other possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But also, good for Darwin.  Because we are part of the universe, every scientific discovery helps us understand who we are; how species evolve is simply a discovery where the connection is all too obvious.  Darwin is a scientific hero both for the brilliance of his theory (not to mention his observations as a naturalist), but also for the symbolic role of evolution as a triumph of reality over wishful thinking.  If the evidence had indicated that we were designed as part of some Great Plan, the scientifically respectable thing to do would have been to accept that and try to understand it as well as we could.  Good science is often &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/06/22/if-its-not-disturbing-youre-not-doing-it-right/"&gt;disturbing&lt;/a&gt;, because the things we don’t yet understand about the world are (pretty much by definition) the things that are difficult and surprising.  But reality always wins out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Darwin represents, in a way that even Newton and Einstein and others do not, a triumph of the true human spirit — the drive to get things right and come to terms with how the world really works, regardless of how it all makes us feel in the end.  Once we buy into that spirit and appreciate the thrill of honest discovery, of course, we find that it makes us feel pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to all the random people celebrating birthdays today — Ray Manzarek, Arsenio Hall, former Boston Celtics center, Bill Russell, Jim Creeggan, bass player for Barenaked Ladies, etc. — both Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln turn the big 200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin’s and Lincoln’s lives and accomplishments are still in the public consciousness; Darwin in part because of the political struggles between evolutionists and creationists, and Lincoln because the U.S. just elected its first black president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today’s Inquisition is an obvious one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who would win in a fight between Chuck Darwin and Abe Lincoln?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you’re not in a violent mood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you do anything to celebrate birthdays (yours or other people’s), or is it just another day?

Obviously you all know it already, and I (usually?) hate to beat a dead and fossilized horse, but there are amusing shenanigans afoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I’ll be at the &lt;a href="http://darwinday.fas.harvard.edu/party.html"&gt;Harvard Darwin Day party&lt;/a&gt; tonight around 8pm. You should be, too! If you’re not around my neck of the woods, check out &lt;a href="http://darwinday.org/"&gt;DarwinDay.org&lt;/a&gt; to find something local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I just published a short Darwin Day post over on &lt;a href="http://bostonist.com/2009/02/12/happy_darwin_day.php"&gt;Bostonist&lt;/a&gt;. Go, read, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Today’s your last day to enter the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5827"&gt;Skepchick Darwinian Playlist Contest&lt;/a&gt;. Go, listen, compile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. If you’re on Twitter, I’m running a mini contest to find the best Darwinian Pick-up Line! Make it short and sweet (or dirty) and include the hashtag &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23darwinpickup"&gt;#DarwinPickup&lt;/a&gt;. You can &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rebeccawatson"&gt;follow me here&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/skepchicks"&gt;Skepchicks account here&lt;/a&gt;. Here are previous Skepchick &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=402"&gt;pick-up lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.

&lt;p&gt;Today the front page story in &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; concerned a letter, &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=405335"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modest revolt to save research from red tape&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a letter signed by 20 people (including me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reason for signing the letter was that I am interested in &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=182"&gt;how to get good science&lt;/a&gt;, and I am concerned that the government, and many vice-chancellors, are getting it wrong.  Read also the wonderful essay. &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=186"&gt;The Mismeasurement of Science&lt;/a&gt;,  by Peter Lawrence (who is one of the signatories of the letter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/the-cover-120209.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="657"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter had an accompanying article by Zoe Corbyn, &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=405350&amp;amp;c=2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientists call for a revolt against grant rule they claim will end blue-skies research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Letter  blames research councils’ policies for fall in number of UK Nobel laureates, reports Zoë Corbyn”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also had a leading article by Ann Mroz, &lt;a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;amp;storycode=405363&amp;amp;c=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leader: Short-term outlook, no blue skies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the subtitele “By forcing academics to do R&amp;amp;D for industry, ministers stifle the type of curiosity-driven work that delivers the biggest bangs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “revolt” proposed in the letter is very modest indeed. We propose merely that those who are asked to referee grants will confine themselves to the part of the application that they are able to judge. In most cases that will not include the two pages of arm-waving guesswork about how the results might save  the nation twenty years hence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves the great discoveries, but great discoveries are very rare  If  you want them, you must hire the best people you can, let them get on with it, and accept failure. Lots and lots of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a pity, but nobody knows any better way to do it.  But at least please don’t try to impose worse ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writers point to the fact that since 1980, roughly the time when bureaucracy started to run rampant,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;” .  .  . the changes have resulted in almost a tenfold decrease in the rate at which researchers at UK universities win Nobel prizes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it’s true that we have no way to be sure that the undoubted increase in top-down control has actually been the &lt;em&gt;cause &lt;/em&gt;of the smaller number of Nobel prizes, but there is no doubt that it has wasted a great deal of time that could have been spent more profitably.  It’s intriguing that 1980 is also the time that &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=136"&gt;Francis Wheen&lt;/a&gt; identified as being roughly the start of  what I like to call &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=187"&gt;the age of endarkenment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But what is the point of having a second-to-none academic sector if its commitment to innovation is not matched by commerce and business? British industry’s relatively low investment in science and technology has long been a serious problem that our proxies and governments have consistently ignored. Academics are a much easier target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While understanding that our proxies are often in a difficult situation, they must become more courageous in dealing with Government or they won’t have an enterprise worth protecting. In recent years, they have acquiesced in subjecting academics to withering barrages of control, and researchers’ lives have become bureaucratic nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest turn of the screw inflicts yet another distracting burden, namely that of requiring prospective researchers to write “a two-page impact plan in addition to the case for support”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We the undersigned suggest that it is time for a modest revolt.  We would urge that reviewers for grant applications decline invitations to take these additional pages into consideration and confine their assessments to matters in which they are demonstrably competent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, in research worthy of the name, we are not aware of anyone who would be competent at foretelling specific future benefits and therefore in complying with the request in any meaningful manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot speak for the other signatories, but I expect they, like I, have nothing against industry, and nothing against applied research. The problem. of course, is is that the really big developments are never obvious at the time they are made, and still less at the time you are writing a grant to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, and far less excusably, the Research Councils, often appear to be populated by the sort of people who would have told Michael Faraday to stop wasting his time with those wires and coils, and get to work on something really useful like designing better leather washers for steam pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly there can be no more inappropriate time than this to be urging universities to act more like businesses.  The sight of a bunch of very highly paid bankers who proved incapable of distinguishing good investments from worthless ones is pitiful.  That was their job and they failed to do it on a grand scale,   The fact that the bastions of conservatism, who have spent most of their lives telling us how wicked it is to bail out failing businesses are  now taking many thousands of pounds from me, inspires feelings that are perhaps better left unwritten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is all part of a much more general move to trust nobody to do a job properly, and, worse, to then construct a hierarchy of regulators that consists largely of people who have themselves failed at the job they are supposed to be regulating.  They then lay down the law about how to do the job to those who &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this process is evident not only in government, and not only in Research Councils, but also within universities themselves.  We have the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=226"&gt;managerial culture&lt;/a&gt; that disempowers anyone who does real research and teaching. We have vice-chancellors who support degrees in various sorts of quackery which  they can’t possibly believe to be true, like &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=984#wmin"&gt;Professor Petts of Westminster&lt;/a&gt; (where &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;Amethysts  emit high Yin energy&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;Michael Pittilo of Robert Gordon’s University Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;.  We have vice chancellors who defend corrupt practices by the pharmaceutical industry, &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=193"&gt;as in Sheffield&lt;/a&gt;.  We have lunatic assessment targets, as at &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=182"&gt;Imperial Medical School&lt;/a&gt;.  And of course we have some curious “&lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=212"&gt;Morals in High Places&lt;/a&gt;“. And we have the &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=42"&gt;vice-chancellors’ Trades Union&lt;/a&gt;, UUK, that does nothing to stop these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is time that the Research Councils, and university vice-chancellors  resisted a bit more strongly government pressure to do things in a way that  can only harm the economy (not to mention the universities) in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have nothing to lose but their knighthoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the signatories of the letter mentioned this beautiful quotation..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every important discovery is by definition unpredictable. If it were predictable, it would not be important.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Freeman Dyson (speech when receiving the Britannica Award for excellence in the dissemination of learning for the benefit of mankind, part reported in the Independent, March 12th 1990)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I intend forthwith to copy and paste this into the section of any grant application which asks for impact etc. No more and no less.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has already been some criticism of our letter. It has come, though, not from scientists, but from “science policy professionals”, a new breed of hangers-on who mostly seem to be too far from the coal-front to know how science works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; is written by the head the Research Councils UK Strategy Unit.  &lt;a href="http://hypotheses.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/a-nobel-effort/"&gt;He chooses to concentrate&lt;/a&gt; on the secondary matter of Nobel prizes, rather than answer the real questions. Fortunately Philip Moriarty has tried to keep him to the point, though without any very satisfactory reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Prometheus blog&lt;/strong&gt; from the USA  has an &lt;a href="http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/prometheus/uk-criterion-2-4955"&gt;article by Ryan Meyer&lt;/a&gt; that has given rise to some comments and questions. I have asked him to explain to me what he means by the “social context” of work on single ion channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special court has ruled against parents with autistic children, saying that vaccines are not to blame for their children’s neurological disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judges in the cases said the evidence was overwhelmingly contrary to the parent’s claims — and backed years of science that found no risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 5,000 claims were filed with the U.S. Court of Claims alleging that vaccines caused autism and other neurological problems in their children. To win, they had to show that it was more likely than not that the autism symptoms were directly related to the measles-mumps-rubella shots they received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court still has to rule on separate claims from other families that other vaccines played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN also reported the story &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/11/autism.vaccines/index.html?iref=newssearch"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/"&gt;ABC knocked it out of the park&lt;/a&gt; when they ran the story on the evening news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:  &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=478"&gt;Here’s &lt;/a&gt;Steve Novella’s blog about it too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Jasmine lives in Woodridge, south of Brisbane, in Australia. From the &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,27574,25046492-3102,00.html"&gt;Courier-Mail&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Vicki] Liddle said a kindergarten teacher who knew Jasmine saw the youngster talking to a stranger on the footpath and took her back to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She could have been kidnapped, she could have had a seizure on the road - anything could have happened," Ms Liddle said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that she wasn't seen and no one noticed, and especially the fact that she has a disability, that was phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They didn't even know she was gone."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said her "blood was boiling" over the incident and the fact the principal failed to apologise or talk to her about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blood would be boiling too, not to mention my heart racing, to hear about any 5-year-old child "found wandering." My son is never alone. At home, Jim or me or both of us are with him; at school, he's got 1:1 coverage at school. He's actually not inclined to wander or run away though. Charlie's liking for routine, habit, and &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/an-idea-of-order/"&gt;works in his favor&lt;/a&gt; in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been regular accounts in the news of various &lt;a href="http://roanoke.injuryboard.com/miscellaneous/lets-keep-track-of-autistic-children-and-demented-elders.aspx?googleid=257106"&gt;devices&lt;/a&gt; to help keep track of children on the spectrum and others who might be prone to elope. Dora posted recently about the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_safety_and_danger_of_police_registries"&gt;safety and dangers of police registries&lt;/a&gt; for individuals on the spectrum and, in some parts of New Jersey, you can register your child with the local police. More than a few of my friends have told me about their child wandering away (unclothed, in two cases).  Again, my own son does not seem inclined to wander off but one never knows and it's the sort of thing that a parent can't take any chances on----and that a school, functioning &lt;em&gt;in loco parentis&lt;/em&gt;, certainly ought not to at all.&lt;/p&gt;

Asperger's exists in adults, like woah! (This is news, how?)  Er, anyway, I say oddly titled because to me the article seemed less about love and more about the things people assume--and how new understanding can adjust those assumptions to align better with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an enormous systems geek, and adore &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uPAMkK118OcC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=the+fifth+discipline&amp;amp;ei=56-TSZuLCoTOlQTXtvnlCQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fifth Discipline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Senge"&gt;Peter Senge&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the ideas examined in that book is the concept of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_models"&gt;"mental models"&lt;/a&gt;--the simplified internal representations and explanations of the world that people carry in their heads.  Mental models are filters or assumptions that are used to speed up decision making.  Senge spends a chapter on the dangers of unchecked assumptions, and discussing tools to help people to to gain better awareness and control of their assumptions.  In that section, p. 192 - 193,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that Laura is a superior or colleague who has some particular habits that others have noted.  She rarely offers generous praise.  She often stares off into space when people talk to her, and then asks, "What did you say?"  She sometimes cuts people off when they speak.  She never comes to office parties.  And in performance reviews, she mutters two or three sentences and then dismisses the person.  From these particular behaviors, Laura's colleagues have concluded that she "doesn't care much about people..."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has happened to Laura is that her colleagues have made a "leap of abstraction." They have substituted a generalization, "not caring about people," for many specific behaviors.  More importantly, they have begun to treat this generalization as &lt;em&gt;fact&lt;/em&gt;.  No one questions anymore whether or not Laura cares about people.  It is a given...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura's colleagues, like most of us, are not disciplined in distinguishing what they observe directly from the generalizations they infer from their observations...Failing to distinguish direct observation from generalizations inferred from observations leads us never to think to test the generalization.  So no one asked Laura whether or not she cares.  If they had, they might have found out that, in her mind, she does care very much.  They might also have learned that she has a hearing impediment that she hasn't told anyone about and, largely because of that, she is painfully shy in conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back now to the little Digital Journal article, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new information about diagnosis and treatment of individuals with Asperger's syndrome can be helpful to many people. It also explains why that cute guy doesn't respond to the good-looking gal who winks and flirts and why she just might have to take up economics or song-writing to get his attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really pleased to see this idea of checking the assumption of "that person doesn't like me" with the possible reality of "that person may be autistic."  I would like to see this lesson also taken a little closer to Senge's Laura story though: assuming that because a person is labeled autistic they do not care about people is just as bad as assuming "Laura doesn't care about people" when in fact Laura is hard of hearing.  Like what Laura's office mates observed, an autism diagnosis only describes a set of observable behaviors; it does not in any way describe the reason for those behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I thought you didn't like me because you didn't respond when I said hello," someone told me once.  "I realize now it was probably because you didn't recognize me or weren't able to speak."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234469509186"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4153">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc50759f8862c568</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Steve Steve" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="stevesteve" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="steve steve"/><title type="html">1000 Steves on Darwin&amp;#39;s 200th!</title><published>2009-02-12T20:13:51Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T20:13:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/1000-steves-on.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1000&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Steve of Project Steve, also known as the kilosteve, is going to be announced at the Annual Meeting of the AAAS this weekend.

&lt;p&gt;Three separate test cases were before special courts, all alleging that autism was caused by vaccines. The courts were set up by the government as part of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, done basically to look at the very rare cases where it was possible that vaccines caused some harm to the people inoculated. The cases started in 2007, and in all three courts, &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/12/AR2009021201391.html"&gt;the rulings were basically identical&lt;/a&gt;: there is no cause to compensate parents of autistic children due to the vaccines those children received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, these three special courts all ruled that in these cases &lt;strong&gt;there is no scientific claim that vaccines cause autism&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in one ruling, a special master (the judge, essentially) said the parents of one troubled child had &amp;quot;been misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment.&amp;quot; The claims of links between autism and vaccines were also cited as &amp;quot;speculative and unpersuasive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to these parents, looking for some sort of reason why their children are autistic. I can hardly imagine what that must be like. But it is absolutely 100% critical that in our emotional and utterly human outreach for an explanation that &lt;em&gt;we do not grasp at the wrong ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines don’t cause autism. The science is extremely persuasive, and I would even say conclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I have said before, the vocal antivaxxers will not be persuaded by this. They are impervious to reason, impervious to evidence, and impervious to facts. They are not looking at this rationally, they have a religious fervor and nothing can sway them from that. Here is a quote &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29160138/"&gt;from one article on the new rulings&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it is a mistake to conclude that, because these few test cases were denied compensation, it’s been decided vaccines don’t play any role in regressive autism,” said Barbara Loe Fisher, the [National Vaccine Information] center’s president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is complete nonsense. It’s not been decided based on these rulings, it’s been decided based on many scientifically-produced tests looking for any link between vaccines and autism. These &lt;em&gt;rulings&lt;/em&gt; were based on a few test cases, and &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; were unpersuasive &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt;. Scientifically, the results are extremely persuasive, if you happen to live in the reality-based community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point being that vocal antivaxxers don’t have property anywhere near there. This ruling will only make them dig in further, and double their efforts to make sure that children &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/09/measles-on-the-rise-in-australia-and-switzerland-too/"&gt;all across the planet&lt;/a&gt; become victims to diseases which can kill or debilitate them, diseases which can be prevented by the simple effort of getting a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rulings are incredibly important, and definitely cause for celebration. But the two things we must always remember to do: have sympathy for the parents in these situations (but not so much that we are swayed by unreasonable arguments), and be vigilant. The antivaxxers will not go away, and we must keep fighting. It cannot be overstated: the lives of our children are at stake here. This is nothing less than a pending global health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234466224654"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3975">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79f450b07e343ba0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="naming" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="prediction markets" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="recession" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">Is It Time to Name This Recession?</title><published>2009-02-12T18:43:33Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T18:43:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/is-it-time-to-name-this-recession/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/is-it-time-to-name-this-recession/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/is-it-time-to-name-this-recession/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">As evidenced by this chart from the betting site Intrade, the probability of Slumdog Millionaire winning the Oscar for Best Picture has risen over the past two months right along with the probability that 2009 will be a year of recession (i.e., two negative quarters of G.D.P.):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government argued during the 2007 bench trials that the plaintiffs' claims linking the vaccines with autism are not supported by "good science."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Likewise, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the Institute of Medicine have found no credible link between vaccinations and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does not diminish the pain the families have gone through, but it's not enough to announce that you suffer, and therefore you get to lash out at a target.

&lt;p&gt;There's something else I'll have to miss, again: the &lt;a href="http://www.tccsa.tc/fair.html"&gt;Creation Science Fair&lt;/a&gt; in Minneapolis will be taking place this weekend. I&amp;#39;ve seen enough photos to know that it&amp;#39;s a rather sad event, though — poor kids misled into doing weak science backed up by silly bible verses. I do get back reasonably early on Sunday, but the first thing I have to get to is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/content/view/255/1%22"&gt;Darwin Year Panel Discussion&lt;/a&gt; in St Paul! This is open to the public, so if you're looking for something smart to do on Sunday afternoon, come on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2009 marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origins of Species. In honor of this, we have assembled a distinguished panel of scientists to give us their thoughts on evolution, creationism, and Darwin. The panelists are: PZ Myers, Randy Moore, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/"&gt;Greg Laden&lt;/a&gt;, Sehoya Cotner, and Jane Phillips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion will be moderated by Lynn Fellman. Lynn is a frequent science interviewer on our Atheists Talk radio program. She is also an independent artist and designer (FellmanStudio.com) who incorporates science into her work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

Clearly, Olbermann was so blinded by his hatred of Rupert Murdoch that all chief apologist for the antivaccine movement, former freelance journalist David Kirby, had to do was mention that The Times of London, the newspaper that published Brian Deer's excellent investigative report nailing anti-MMR guru Andrew Wakefield to the wall for falsifying data, is owned by Rupert Murdoch, and it was like waving the proverbial red cape in front of the bull. Like a bull on crack, Olbermann didn't think too much before he charged ahead, parroting the misinformation and talking points spoon fed to him by David Kirby. Leaving aside the fact that this made Olbermann look like an even bigger fool--not to mention a huge hypocrite--for having nailed a FOX News reporter for reading word-for-word Republican talking points as analysis just the day before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, unfortunately for Keith Olbermann, Brian Deer is actually in the states and has seen both the &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/29148912#29148912"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/keith-olbermann-todays-be_b_166103.html"&gt;David Kirby's bragging about it&lt;/a&gt;. He also gave me permission to post his letter to the producers of &lt;em&gt;Countdown&lt;/em&gt;. Showing what a fair-minded individual he is, even though he detests Andrew Wakefield as much as I do, Deer even complains about the inaccuracies in Olbermann's attack on Wakefield the night before:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/brian_deer_responds_to_keith_olbermann.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/brian_deer_responds_to_keith_olbermann.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/5zsf79wIkqI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234462985810"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1135">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/513eb02fbe742301</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Punctuation"/><title type="html">High Five((')s) for Science</title><published>2009-02-12T18:14:38Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T18:14:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1135" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ten days ago I was returning to the US from Europe, and the first and main leg of the trip was a flight from Amsterdam to Houston. After passing through customs and immigration in Houston, I was stripping off shoes, belt, wallet, fillings, etc. to walk through the security scanners and re-enter the gate areas for my connecting flight. The scanners were being worked by a few twenty-somethings, and one of them was enthusiastically telling the others, "You know, today's Darwin's 200th birthday! High five for science!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was given a slightly bemused high-five by one of his coworkers, and then he turned to another with the same celebratory request, but sadly the other coworker, conforming more to my mental Texan stereotype, wouldn't meet his eyes and wouldn't high five him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'll give you a high five for science!" I called out happily. "That's what I'm talkin' about!" he said, and so after exchanging a high five for science with a perfect, if slightly goofy, stranger, I trotted off to my next five hours of travel feeling all warm and fuzzy. I didn't have the heart to tell him he was off on the birthday by ten days; hopefully he's exchanging high-fives today as well. Maybe he's exchanging high-fives for emancipation today instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give this post some mildly linguistic content, I refer you back to its header, which I assert would be a perfectly grammatical headline in any of its permutations: with or without the -s, and with or without the apostrophe…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Five for Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what I got/did. It could also be an imperative, a quote from my subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Fives for Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I witnessed multiple high fives for science, so equally accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Five's for Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is fine read as (A/The) High Five is for Science; it kind of reifies my high five but plenty of headlines exist on this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only bring it up because I've been interestedly following AZ's &lt;a title="apostrophe 1" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1090"&gt;apostrophe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="apostrophe 2" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1116"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on the LLog of late. The capital city of my home province has an apostrophe -'s at the end, and it's a matter of some import. St. John's, Newfoundland, where I'm from, forms a minimal pair with St. John, New Brunswick, another town in a small province beginning with "New" in Atlantic Canada. That's why I was shocked and appalled to read, in a quote from Michael Quinion in Arnold's second piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Words when forming geographic names have lost their connotative aspects; the name is merely a label, and therefore ownership or association is no longer relevant.&lt;br&gt;
Those who oppose losing the apostrophe may argue that the final "s" should then go, too, since you need both to mark possessives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough people accidentally book flights to St. John when intending St. John's as it is, without stripping the latter of its genitive! (I presume the reverse flight-booking is also a problem.) Maybe we could get by without an apostrophe — but that -s has got to stay.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Heidi Harley</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234461061883"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=478">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84b83c3d73575b27</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Autism Court Ruling - Vaccines Didn’t Cause Autism</title><published>2009-02-12T17:38:36Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T17:38:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=478" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The much awaited decision on the first test case of the Autism Omnibus was just announced - and it’s good news. They have found that the petitioners failed to make their case that vaccines caused their children’s autism, and that therefore compensation was not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Autism Omnibus hearings were set up to evaluate for thousands of petitions for compensation under the vaccine injury compensation program. This is a program set up in the US to compensate those who suffer adverse effects from vaccines, and it is paid for by a tax on all vaccines. This is a sensible system because it allows manufacturers to produce much needed vaccines without risking bankruptcy over fad pseudoscientific accusations - like those that took down Dow Chemical. It also more quickly and fairly compensated families, which is fair given that vaccines are somewhat compulsory in the US (although in most states it is all too easy to get an exemption).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases arise out of the now scientifically discredited notion that certain vaccines or something in vaccines (like thimerosal) is linked to autism. I have written extensively about this controversy, and what we can say at this time is that the scientific evidence is solidly against any link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been watching these cases closely as they constitute a review of this evidence. It is not a scientific review, but rather a legal one. This can go either way. On the one hand, courts have rules of evidence and when the evidence is given a proper hearing and it strongly points in one direction, that usually becomes clear. Also, this is a hearing before special judges - not a jury whose emotions can be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the standard of evidence for the compensation program has been significantly lowered recently. To make it easier to compensate families, they only have to provide a plausible theory of injury - not evidence that the theory is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/142/"&gt;thorough summary&lt;/a&gt; of the process over at Neurodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while we were confident that the evidence clearly favored no link between autism and vaccines, there remained an outside chance that this lower bar of evidence might have lead to a decision that “compensation is appropriate.” This would not have meant the evidence supported a link, but certainly would have been spun that way by the anti-vaccine crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions that were published today are therefore both a relief that the system worked, and a thorough smackdown of the anti-vaccine claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three test cases decided on today, each one representing a theory of harm - that MMR alone causes autism, that thimerosal alone causes autism, and that a combination of MMR and thimerosal causes autism. The decisions published today only affect the thimerosal + MMR theory of causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special Master Hastings wrote the &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf"&gt;decision on the Cedillo case,&lt;/a&gt; which alleged that a combination of MMR and thimerosal caused her autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I conclude that the petitioners have not demonstrated that they are entitled to an award on Michelle’s behalf. I will set forth the reasons for that conclusion in detail below. However, at this point I will briefly summarize the reasons for my conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petitioners in this case have advanced a causation theory that has several parts, including contentions  that thimerosal-containing vaccines can cause immune dysfunction, that the MMR vaccine can cause autism, and  that the MMR vaccine can cause chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, as to each of those issues, I concluded that the evidence was overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners’ contentions. The expert witnesses presented by the respondent were far better qualified, far more experienced, and far more persuasive than the petitioners’ experts, concerning most of the key points. The numerous medical studies concerning these issues, performed by medical scientists worldwide, have come down strongly against the petitioners’ contentions. Considering all of the evidence, I found that the petitioners have failed to demonstrate that thimerosal-containing vaccines can contribute to causing immune dysfunction, or that the MMR vaccine can contribute to causing either autism or gastrointestinal dysfunction. I further conclude that while Michelle Cedillo has tragically suffered from autism and other severe conditions, the petitioners have also failed to demonstrate that her vaccinations played any role at all in causing those problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to know that overwhelming solid scientific evidence still counts for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing the decision for the second case, Hazlehurst, Special Master Campbell-Smith wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having carefully and fully considered the evidence, the undersigned concludes that the combination of the thimerosal-containing vaccines and the MMR vaccine are not causal factors in the development of autism and therefore, could not have contributed to the development of Yates’ autism. The weight of the presented evidence that is scientifically reliable and methodologically sound does not support petitioners’ claim. Petitioners have failed to establish entitlement to compensation under the Vaccine Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, writing the decision for the third case, Snyder, Special Master Vowell wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After considering the record as a whole, I hold that petitioners have failed to establish by preponderant evidence that Colten’s condition was caused or significantly aggravated by a vaccine or any component thereof. The evidence presented was both voluminous and extraordinarily complex. After careful consideration of all of the evidence, it was abundantly clear that petitioners’ theories of causation were speculative and unpersuasive. Respondent’s experts were far more qualified, bettersupported by the weight of scientific research and authority, and simply morepersuasive on nearly every point in contention. Because of pervasive quality control problems at a now-defunct laboratory that tested a key piece of evidence, petitioners could not reliably demonstrate the presence of a persistent measles virus in Colten’s central nervous system. Petitioners failed to establish that measles virus can cause autism or that it did so in Colten. They failed to demonstrate that amount of ethylmercury in TCVs causes immune system suppression or dysregulation. They failed to show that Colten’s immune system was dysregulated. Although Colten’s condition markedly improved between his diagnosis and the hearing, the experimental treatments he received cannot be logically or scientifically linked to the theories of causation. Given the advice that petitioners received from a treating physician, Colten’s parents brought this action in good faith and upon a reasonable basis. However, they have failed to demonstrate vaccine causation of Colten’s condition by a preponderance of the evidence. Therefore, I deny their petition for compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, two, three strikes, your out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions reflect the overall impression of the scientific community - the theories behind the notion that vaccines cause autism are speculative and the evidence is strongly against them. Also, the experts who have looked at the evidence and have concluded that vaccines do not cause autism simply know what they are talking about, while the anti-vaccine experts were unimpressive and not persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a solid victory, much as the Dover decision (which thoroughly went through the scientific arguments for evolution and the nonsense of Intelligent Design) was for science and the teaching of evolution.  We can now expect desperate spin from the anti-vaccine crowd. That should be fun (while also depressing) to watch. And, just as with ID, it is unlikely that even this solid trouncing will end anti-vaccine pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;

I mentioned that the energy created in the collision was about the same as detonating a ton of TNT. I got asked how I did that math. That’s no problem (well, a little one), but a bigger problem is that I screwed up the physics of the orbits. As commenter &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/11/satellites-collide-in-orbit/#comment-155415"&gt;Marco Langbroek&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, the angle of impact I used was wrong. I forgot about the angle of the nodes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both satellites were in polar orbits, more or less. One had an inclination (tilt) of about 86 degrees to the Equator — in other words, it passed 4 degrees (90 - 86 = 4) from being directly over the Earth’s poles, and the other had an inclination of 74 degrees from the Equator. I assumed that meant that the angle of approach was 12 degrees. FYI, a head on collision would be an angle of approach of 180 degrees (they are moving in opposite directions, toward each other), one catching up to the other would be 0 degrees, and a broadside &amp;quot;T-bone&amp;quot; collision is an angle of 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where did I screw this up? The inclination is not the only important angle. What’s also important is what’s called the node of an orbit, or the angle &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the Earth. Here’s an illustration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/02/satellite_nodes.jpg" alt="Earth with two possible satellite orbits"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yellow and red tracks represent two polar satellite orbits. You can see that a satellite in either orbit will pass very close over the Earth’s pole (the south pole is seen here), so the inclinations of both orbits is high, near 90 degrees. But you can see they are rotated with respect to each other, in this case by about 60 degrees. That means that where they intersect, over the Earth’s poles, the angle between them is about 60 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has a huge impact (har har) on the collision speed. If they had the same node and the same inclination, the collision speed would be zero; they’d be on the same orbit. But if the nodes are rotated by 90 degrees, the collision would be a broadside, one slamming directly into the side of the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened with the Cosmos and Iridium satellites. The inclination difference was about 12 degrees, but the node angle difference was about 83 degrees (according to Mr. Langbroek, whose word I’ll accept here &lt;a href="http://sattrackcam.blogspot.com/"&gt;since he’s an amateur satellite tracker&lt;/a&gt;). So the impact angle was almost a total broadside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does that affect the energy of the impact? Well, it’s possible to get a pretty rough idea. What follows is basically a back-of-the-envelope calculation, meant to be pretty loose. BotE calculations aren’t supposed to be truly accurate; they’re meant to give you &lt;em&gt;an idea&lt;/em&gt; of the resulting number. So I wouldn’t be surprised if the true conclusion I reach here as far as explosive yield is concerned is off by a factor of 2 or more, but the thing is I don’t care. We’re just trying to grasp the &lt;em&gt;magnitude&lt;/em&gt; of the forces involved, not their exact measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.virginia.edu/ep/Interactions/1__introduction_&amp;amp;_collision_kinematics.htm"&gt;The collision energy depends on the relative velocities of the satellites&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine two cars approaching an intersection. One car is in the middle when the other slams into it at a 90 degree angle. The only important number here is the velocity of the impacting car; the velocity of the other one doesn’t matter. It could be sitting there in the intersection, or moving at 100 kph; the velocity of the collision really only depends on how fast the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; car was moving when it hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, with satellites, it’s more complicated. The actual three dimensional trigonometry of the event is a little fierce, but it turns out that an impact at 83 degrees is mathematically very close to a simple 90 degree collision (the difference in angles results in just a small percentage difference in velocity). In other words, a car hitting you at an 83 degree angle has almost the same velocity as if it were hitting you exactly broadside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the satellites were both moving at the same speed, the impact velocity then is simply the velocity of &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the satellites, or about 8 kilometers per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy of impact depends on the mass of the satellites, too. The Iridium satellite was about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_(satellite)"&gt;700 kg&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cosmos was probably about the same. I couldn’t find a good figure for Cosmos, just estimates… but it’s close enough. Remember, I’m trying to be very rough here; I don’t care if I’m off in my numbers by a factor or two or not; I just want an approximation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kinetic energy of an object is equal to 1/2 x its mass x its velocity&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Again, because I’m being really rough here, it doesn’t matter which satellite hits the other. We can assume they have about the same mass, so the kinetic energy (in ergs, which I’ll explain in a second) is &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;strong&gt;KE = 0.5 x 700,000 grams x (800,000 cm/sec)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; ergs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An erg is a small unit of energy, but 200,000,000,000,000,000 is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of them. Blowing up a ton of TNT releases about 4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; ergs, so this collision was roughly the equivalent of lobbing &lt;em&gt;5 tons of TNT&lt;/em&gt; at the satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boom. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[FWIW, my mistake in the previous post was assuming the collision angle was 12 degrees, and the velocity of collision depends on the sine of the angle between the objects. Sin(12) = .20, so my number was 1/5 as big as it should be.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why there’s a large cloud of expanding debris; each piece of shattered satellite carried away a piece of that violent energy release. The energy of collision changed the orbits of all those shards, so they are now orbiting the Earth on new paths that take them higher or lower over the surface, right into the traffic lanes of other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So eventually, some may once again find an object in their way. And because of the high velocity, the kinetic energy of impact even from a low-mass piece can be pretty fierce. A rifle bullet does a huge amount of damage when it hits something, and it has a mass of about 10 grams and moves at a paltry 1 km/sec. Now think of the damage inflicted by a small satellite chunk that masses about 1 kg (100 times as much as the bullet) and moving 8 times faster… the energy of impact is &lt;em&gt;6400&lt;/em&gt; times that of the bullet. Imagine getting hit by &lt;em&gt;six thousand rifle bullets&lt;/em&gt;, and you start to get an idea of why satellite collisions are not just catastrophic for the two birds involved, but also a danger to other objects in orbit as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234459125274"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/200_years_since_darwins_birth_what_about.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8028dfe086b5f8db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">200 years since Darwin's birth, what about medicine?</title><published>2009-02-12T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/k4DIB_HHASw/200_years_since_darwins_birth_what_about.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/200_years_since_darwins_birth_what_about.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href="http://www.darwinday.org/"&gt;Darwin Day&lt;/a&gt;. But, more than that, it is a very special Darwin Day in that it is the 200th anniversary of the birth of evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin. This day is meant to celebrate not just the life, but especially the discoveries, of Charles Darwin. His theory of evolution by natural selection, is one of the most elegant examples of science in history. Darwin's theory was so robust that subsequent discoveries did not invalidate it. Rather, many were either predicted or easily accommodated in evolutionary theory, and many more complemented it, such that, in the early 20th century, there was a modern synthesis of new discoveries in genetics and evolutionary theory, and that synthesis only made evolutionary theory stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, although current evolutionary theory has become even richer and more complex than Darwin's original theory, it has also changed. Natural selection, although still considered a very important, if not the most important, mechanism driving evolution is now understood to be but one of several mechanisms of evolution, so much so that some have exaggerated the situation by declaring Darwin to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2009/01/the_buzz_was_darwin_wrong.php"&gt;have been wrong&lt;/a&gt;. He was not, at least not under the constraints of the science available to him in the 1800s. Indeed, new discoveries in genetics, molecular biology, genomics, and proteonomics do not cast doubt on evolution; rather they produce results entirely consistent with it. Remember, Charles Darwin knew nothing of DNA, molecular biology, or genetics. Yet much of his theory has been supported by these new discoveries. Some of it has not, but I have a hard time thinking of another scientific theory that has held up so well for 150 years.&lt;br&gt;

Several schools in Wisconsin hold their graduation ceremonies in local churches, and &lt;a href="http://www.au.org/site/News2?abbr=pr&amp;amp;page=NewsArticle&amp;amp;id=10295&amp;amp;security=1002&amp;amp;news_iv_ctrl=1241"&gt;Americans United is threatening litigation to block them&lt;/a&gt;. One the one hand, I am all for secularizing &amp;#39;sacred&amp;#39; spaces — let&amp;#39;s take them all over and do something useful with them for a change. On the other, I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s what this particular situation is all about, since it looks like the schools are using the churches to pollute what should be a secular ceremony with religious smog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a poll, so you can weigh in on the topic…and like all online polls, I&amp;#39;m sure this one will be incredibly influential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jsonline.com/polls/39480267.html"&gt;Should public schools be allowed to hold graduation in a church building?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes (79%)&lt;br&gt;

No (21%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lots of it is interesting, and lots of it is stupid. This morning, when I was checking my mail, I found an email from a creationist in my mailbox, which puts forth an "proof" against atheism that I hadn't seen before. It's about as idiotic as most creationist arguments are,
but it's one that I've never seen before, and it's interesting to shred it from the viewpoint of mathematical logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Here's his argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now to the main point, and somewhat more interesting stuff.  I recently ran across a proof (perhaps not in the mathematical sense; I don't know) against atheism.  Atheism, both in the forms I've encountered and in logical necessity, requires that matter/energy is eternal, since the atheist would by necessity argue against any point at which matter/energy came into existence.  Nothing does not create something.  For anything to be eternal and be in the present, it must by necessity have come from eternity past.  However, between eternity past and the present, there is an infinite amount of time.  Therefore, traveling forward from eternity past, one could never reach the present day.  Therefore, atheism cannot be true, and a definite point at which matter/energy came into existence is necessary.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; What's wrong with this?

The relevant passage of the preliminary report is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transform our Economy with Science and Technology:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To secure America’s role as a world leader in a competitive global economy, we are renewing America’s investments in basic research and development, in training students for an innovation economy, and in deploying new technologies into the marketplace.  This will help businesses in every community succeed in a global economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investing in Scientific Research (More than $15 Billion) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
o    Provides $3 billion for the National Science Foundation, for basic research in fundamental science and engineering – which spurs discovery and innovation.&lt;br&gt;
o    Provides $1.6 billion for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, which funds research in such areas as climate science, biofuels, high-energy physics, nuclear physics and fusion energy sciences – areas crucial to our energy future.&lt;br&gt;
o    Provides $400 million for the Advanced Research Project Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to support high-risk, high-payoff research into energy sources and energy efficiency in collaboration with industry.&lt;br&gt;
o    Provides $580 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, including the Technology Innovation Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership.&lt;br&gt;
o    Provides $8.5 billion for NIH, including expanding good jobs in biomedical research to study diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cancer, and heart disease.&lt;br&gt;
o    Provides $1 billion for NASA, including $400 million to put more scientists to work doing climate change research.&lt;br&gt;
o    Provides $1.5 billion for NIH to renovate university research facilities and help them compete for biomedical research grants.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOE Office of Science and NSF funds had been zeroed out in one version of the Senate measure proposed last week, and were set to $330 million and $1.2 billion respectively in the bill the Senate passed.  This is a huge boost for our scientific infrastructure in this country, and will immediately create large numbers of jobs for a broad range of workers.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime event: let’s spend the money wisely!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next challenge: the 2009 and 2010 budgets for science.  We are still operating under a CR, and without an increase in funding, the national labs and universities will have to shed personnel.  Stimulus money will not be used to directly fund scientists and engineers at the labs, or postdocs or graduate students at the universities.  That money comes from the yearly budget.  Obama has pledged to double funding for the physical sciences in 10 years.  Let your congressfolk know you care about this!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shenanigans In Belfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/feb/12/northern-ireland-charles-darwin-courts"&gt;As reported by the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, a museum in Belfast is planning an exhibit on Darwin. In response, Mervyn Storey, a Democratic Unionist member of the Northern Ireland assembly, warned that he will take legal action to force the museum to give equal space to a creationist exhibit. The Guardian quotes him as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They could be subject to a legal challenge under equality legislation within Northern Ireland if they chose to ignore alternative views that many people here in the Province believe in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder to which “alternative views” Storey (a born-again Christian) is referring? Perhaps he wants to give space to the &lt;a href="http://www.rael.org/rael_content/rael_summary.php"&gt;Raelian&lt;/a&gt; view that humans were planted on earth by aliens. The museum clearly needs to make space for an exhibit of space aliens cloning the first humans in their image. Or maybe that’s not what he had in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspicuously absent from Storey’s statement is the word “science”. It would be legitimate to reflect in the exhibit any viable alternative scientific views to evolution, but at the present time there aren’t any.  Mervyn’s “equal time” argument has already failed in the US, but here there is a constitutional guarantee of separation of church and state. I am not familiar enough with the laws of Northern Ireland to comment on the legality of trying to force religious views into the scientific arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mervyn also offered up this old chestnut:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also described Charles Darwin as a “racist” over his description of aboriginal peoples in his other classic tome The Descent of Man. “In this politically correct society we live in today, if Darwin expressed those views about other peoples of the world now he would not be put on any pedestal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love arguments that are both factually wrong and logically flawed. This is a clear attempt to poison the well by painting Darwin as a racist. This is done through cherry picking data and presenting them in the wrong context. It is not fair to judge Darwin by the standards of today. We live in a different time. By today’s standards many of the comments of Abraham Lincoln, who shares Darwin’s birthday, would also be considered inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/WhoWas.html"&gt;Darwin is on record&lt;/a&gt; in his personal correspondence of being vehemently opposed to slavery.  His views were actually progressive for his time. Darwin makes a very poor villain, but that doesn’t stop some creationists from trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, of course, it is entirely irrelevant. If Darwin were a womanizing, drug-abusing, criminal racist, evolution would still be correct. Unable to attack the science of evolution, however (at least not successfully), some creationists try to equate the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory with “Darwinism,” and then attack Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a ray of hope for Northern Ireland, however. The Guardian reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former school teacher is also campaigning to have creationism and intelligent design theory taught in Northern Ireland’s schools. However the Sinn Fein education minister, Catriona Ruane, insisted they would not form any part of the schools’ curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s good to hear.  Mervyn should be treated as the fringe crank that he is, and hopefully there are enough scientifically literate and reasonable people in the education ministry to keep him on the fringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pope and Darwin Make Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vatican has finally cleared up speculation that Pope Benedict XVI might have sympathies toward intelligent design (ID). They are hosting a conference on evolution in honor of the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin. They are using the event to make it clear that the Vatican has no problem with Darwin or evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact they initially planned to ban ID from the conference, calling it “bad science and bad theology,” but have since relented, allowing it to be discussed only as a “cultural phenomenon.” The &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5705331.ece"&gt;TimesOnline reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leading official declared yesterday that Darwin’s theory of evolution was compatible with Christian faith, and could even be traced to St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas. “In fact, what we mean by evolution is the world as created by God,” said Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi, head of the Pontifical Council for Culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Catholic church is now trying to take some credit for the theory of evolution is a good sign (if historically dubious) - that’s often the final stage of acceptance, taking credit for it all along. To be fair, they admit that the Vatican was initially hostile to Darwin, although they never rejected him or evolution, and claim that as far back as 1950 the church has accepted evolution as science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religion and Evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, evolutionary theory is a science and stands on its own according to the scientific evidence.  Whether or not any religious authority accepts evolutionary theory is irrelevant to the science. But it is important to the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to see a major faith moving in this direction. I have never had any problem with personal faith. Although I currently am agnostic and have no need for personal faith, it really doesn’t concern me what answers people come to for unanswerable questions.  However, I have a big problem with one group imposing their faith on others, or with imposing one’s faith on the practice of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me as a failed strategy for a religion to go to war with science - to hitch their faith to empirical claims about the physical world. This is a setup for disaster. If the world does not match their claims, that either jeopardizes their faith, or they must subjugate science to their religious beliefs.  This leads to bad theology and bad science, as the Vatican pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://www.findingdarwinsgod.com/excerpt/index.html"&gt;Kenneth Miller&lt;/a&gt; (a Christian and evolutionary biologist) got it right in Finding Darwin’s God when he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creationist opponents of evolution make similar arguments. They claim that the existence of life, the appearance of new species, and, most especially, the origins of mankind have not and cannot be explained by evolution or any other natural process. By denying the self-sufficiency of nature, they look for God (or at least a “designer”) in the deficiencies of science. The trouble is that science, given enough time, generally explains even the most baffling things. As a matter of strategy, creationists would be well-advised to avoid telling scientists what they will never be able to figure out. History is against them. In a general way, we really do understand how nature works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If nature is self-sufficient - if it works - then evolution is an unavoidable consequence. Denying this has not worked out well for any faith, and has only served to hamper mankind’s scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Miller is leading to is the necessary separation of faith and science.  We can have a philosophical argument about naturalism, agnosticism, or any metaphysical view of reality. But this is separate from science as a system of investigating the natural world (and which is only dependent upon methodological naturalism, not philosophical naturalism). Science works, and the process of science must be respected for it to work properly, regardless of one’s faith about ultimate reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The religions of the world would do well to follow the Vatican’s example. Believe what you want, but leave science alone to do what it does. If you war with science, both suffer, but in the long run science seems to have the edge because it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Concluding Darwin Day Fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will leave you with this bit of fun. Take it for what it is (i.e. not serious commentary). Some of you have probably seen this already - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGNRYNdVT7g"&gt;MC Hawking raps about creationists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday, Chuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central theme in post-modernist archaeology of the more science-friendly, not radically relativist kind for the past 20 years has been the study of the after-life of monuments, or "the past in the past". Archaeologists are of course keenly interested in the archaeological record, and I think there's a reasonable argument for studies of how the people we study engaged with the remains around them in &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; era. Mind you, I think this should be treated as a side issue and a bit of a novelty. I've heard Mesolithic scholars proclaim that a lithics scatter in a river bank was as significant to later generations of hunters as Stonehenge is to us. No -- people in the past must be assumed to not have given a damn about ancient remains unless it can be clearly proven that they treated them in some distinctive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw a fine example of not giving a damn in Chester last week. Considerable stretches of the town's Roman wall survive as part of the Medieval town wall, which is in turn largely preserved because it was turned into a fashionable walkway in the Early Modern Period. Every now and then work needs to be done on the wall, and almost every time a piece of fine Roman mortuary sculpture is found. This is because the cemeteries of Roman towns were "extramural", located outside the walls, and at a stressful moment some time in the 4th century the burghers of Chester felt the need to reinforce their wall real fast with whatever materials were at hand. So they stripped the town's conveniently located cemeteries of old stonework. Thanks to construction work on the wall in the 1890s, the Grosvenor Museum in Chester has one of the finest collections of Roman mortuary sculpture in all of Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serendipitously, today's issue of the subway newspaper &lt;a href="http://www.metro.se/se/article/2009/02/12/00/1003-45/index.xml"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Metro&lt;/i&gt; has a story&lt;/a&gt; about the outrage such a callous treatment of grave stones can cause. Generally, in the modern West, we take very good care of old things and new things. But all semi-old, fiftyish things are in a dangerous state. If they can just reach a slightly more venerable age, then chances are that they'll be preserved. But most buildings, most institutions, most monuments, never achieve a status as Old and Venerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christian cemeteries are very unsafe places to be buried in. Hallowed ground is finite, and the moment your great-grandkids stop caring about your grave, chances are it will be replaced by a new one. At a cemetery in Gothenburg, the headstones thus displaced have been dumped in the woods along with old wilted wreaths and hedge clippings. Outrage! But get this: people are upset that the stones haven't been given the usual treatment in modern Sweden, which is to be taken away and &lt;i&gt;crushed into gravel!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an archaeologist, I must of course applaud the person who has been dumping these abandoned monuments intact instead of allowing them to be destroyed. He or she has performed a service to future colleagues of mine on a par with what those Roman fortification engineers did at Chester 1700 years ago. Well done!&lt;br&gt;

Keith Olbermann, my hero, the heir apparent to Edward R. Murrow,  and the only reason left to watch cable TV, has been played by the anti-vaccine lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few nights ago, Olbermann called much-needed attention to the UK physician who kicked off the decade-long wave of mass hysteria known as the anti-vaccine movement. During the Countdown segment, Andrew Wakefield, or “Wakers” to his diminishing fan base,  was named The Worst Person in the World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccine activists went on quicksilver alert, and besieged MSNBC with emails, faxes, phone calls and much  gnashing of teeth. Olbermann caved, or rather bent over and grabbed his ankles. It could have been a phone call from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Arriana Huffington, or any number of dwarf stars in the anti-vaccine firmament. Whatever. Olbermann was pwned by the same barking loons who think the Amish don’t vaccinate, and that measles leads to all-you-can-eat ice cream binges. Without evidence or cause, Olbermann repeated vaccine rejectionist talking points, and unfairly attacked the journalist who exposed  Wakefield’s malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit msnbc.com for &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com"&gt;Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507"&gt;World News&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072"&gt;News about the Economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Deer, the freelance investigative journalist whose reporting helped bring Wakefield to justice, is guilty of - investigative journalism. Or, as Olbermann puts it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times of London did not bother to mention that the British investigation into whether or not Wakefield did that was the result of a complaint by… Brian Deer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy who wrote the article about the investigation never mentioned he was the complainant who precipitated the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “complaint” needs to be unpacked. In an administration-speak, a “complaint” is a formal action, documented, and assigned to a party. But Olbermann conflates the dry, boring definition of complaint with the vernacular, which is “an expression of displeasure”. Deer’s reporting is a complaint, but only if you stand way back and squint your eyes, imagine how documenting the activity of an out-of-control doctor might trigger an expression of displeasure, which in turn sets off waves of hand-wringing in the British medical establishment, thus resulting in the filing of a formal complaint. In this case, the complaint was brought by the General Medical Council &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article676040.ece"&gt;with the encouragement of … Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN February 2004, after a Sunday Times investigation, Wakefield declared that he would welcome an inquiry as an opportunity to clear his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article1027465.ece"&gt;he insisted on an investigation&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wakefield said that he would insist on a full GMC inquiry after it was suggested by John Reid, the Health Secretary, on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if MSNBC can tolerate facts, &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1858#comment-56374"&gt;Deer has proof&lt;/a&gt; that he is not “a complainant”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a letter from the GMC’s lawyers, which was also supplied to Wakefield, stating that I am not the complainant, but that I am an “informant”, like, say, a health authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet according to Olbermann, Deer is guilty of “a vast conflict of interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth about the doctor’s research may be in doubt here, but not Deer’s vast conflict of interest nor the Times of London’s journalistic malfeasance. The paper is owned by Rupert Murdoch, and it’s my bad for forgetting his new motto: “We have never been a company that tolerates facts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Deer, an investigative reporter, wrote about Wakefield’s shady research and obvious conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield invited, nay,  insisted upon a full investigation of the allegations outlined in Deer’s articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK medical board obliged Wakefield by filing a formal complaint and commencing the investigation for which Wakefield longed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deer continued to investigate and report the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Keith Olbermann was lured and skewered by a mendacious vaccine rejectionist press release speaks to Rovian levels of media manipulation. “Olbermann’s team fell for it hook, line, and sinker,” &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/keith_olbermann_played_for_a_fool.php"&gt;notes Orac&lt;/a&gt;, to continue the fishing metaphor. “Nor did they consider that the U.K. has some of the most plaintiff-friendly libel laws in the world, so much so that some plaintiffs indulge in  libel tourism there. If Deer’s reporting was not true, he would have been at serious risk of being sued and losing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith, I love ya man, but you really screwed the pooch this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is far from over. Keith’s enemies in the right wing news and entertainment media are legion, and now he’s open  to serious and valid criticism. If this latest skirmish in the autism wars results in a ratcheting up of coverage, Olbermann may be forced to retract once again, or bury his head and wait for the dust to settle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good night and good luck with that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain Deer’s response to Olbermann can be seen &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/brian_deer_responds_to_keith_olbermann.php#more"&gt;at Orac’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. The money quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were apparently supplied with your baseless allegations by a New York-based freelance journalist, David Kirby, who has made substantial sums of money through attacking childhood vaccines, and who is an advisor to Wakefield. Extraordinarily, you even supplied Kirby with a copy of the script of your attack on me, prior to broadcast, and thus appear to have acted in cahoots with him.  Kirby was sufficiently motivated, and stupid, to publish your script on a website before the item was aired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your defamation of me has been taken up by others, and you are plainly responsible for this.  You have no possible defence, since your claims are simply false.  They were fabricated and placed with you by antivaccine campaigners and cranks. You can argue no privilege or free speech right to make such false allegations, not least since you published them with complete disregard for their truth or falsity. NBC’s lawyers will no doubt explain to you the particular difficulties of such conduct in the UK jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab some popcorn. This is going to be good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234452184104"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3979">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5118462efde8a32</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="John Lott"/><title type="html">Justice Prevails</title><published>2009-02-12T17:01:52Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T17:01:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/1BTu74BQXF0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/justice-prevails/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upholds the earlier decision in my favor in the defamation lawsuit filed by John Lott against me.

&lt;p&gt;Get out and celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of one of the most important scientists of all time, Charles Darwin, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of one of the most important books in biology, &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life&lt;/i&gt;. It's that day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in Minnesota, and you have a couple of options here. The Bell Museum in Minneapolis is having a party!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin Day Party&lt;br&gt;
Thursday, February 12, 2009, 7 to 9 p.m.&lt;br&gt;
Bell Museum Auditorium&lt;br&gt;
$10/ free to museum members and University students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers will present in the auditorium from 7 to 8 pm. Birthday cake and refreshments are served after the presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birthday! Part of a world wide celebration, the Twin Cities' version is at The Bell Museum of Natural History this Thursday night. Join in the fun with cake, drinks and presentations by U of M scientists and educators. They will present funny, outrageous and controversial rapid-fire, media-rich presentations about Darwin and evolution. From the big bang to the human genome, hear the newest research and controversy on evolution and Darwin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m rather far from Minneapolis, unfortunately — if you live in the west central part of the state, or the eastern part of the Dakotas, we&amp;#39;re having an open lecture here at the University of Minnesota Morris. Nic McPhee of the computer science discipline and PZ Myers of biology will be talking about &amp;quot;Paths to Complexity: How Biology and Computation can Build Intricate Processes and Systems&amp;quot; — it&amp;#39;s a kind of anti-intelligent-design talk that focuses on the amazing stuff we do know about how chance and selection can build complex systems and efficient solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be on the UMM campus in HFA 6, at 5pm this evening. No charge, but come early — we expect to fill the joint up. If you can&amp;#39;t make it, it is going to be recorded and a podcast made available later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/happy_darwin_day_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xhJNpFqOibU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234451490829"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3931">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd6d4cedb9bbbb12</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="money"/><category term="online dating"/><title type="html">Some Advice for Gold-Diggers</title><published>2009-02-12T15:08:44Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T15:08:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/qvuWXi-fYqs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/some-advice-for-gold-diggers/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The Los Angeles Times reports that membership at online dating sites has increased substantially this year; eHarmony, for example, was up 20 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Why does it seem that the word “Darwinism” and its other variations bothers so many of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word Darwinism was first used by Thomas H. Huxley, Darwin’s Bulldog, when he reviewed Darwin’s The Origin of Species in April 1960.  At that time, the definition of Darwinism was used to describe current evolutionary concepts, including earlier concepts such as Malthusianism and Spencerism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has come a long way, and basically now all one can say about it is “it depends who says it, and in what context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, creationists and IDers use it to describe evolution, they use it as a derogatory term within their circles.  To them it’s a tool for propaganda, a way to say “anyone who accepts Darwin’s theory is an atheist”.  In fact, in 1874 Charles Hodge, the then principal of Princeton Theological Seminary, published the book “What is Darwinism?” where he concludes that the answer is “It is Atheism.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have used the term Darwinism to differentiate between modern evolutionary theories and those proposed by Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it is used today mostly by IDers to refer to the people who accept the theory (and fact) of evolution as dogmatic and unwilling to change their minds about evolution.  Guess they still need to figure out what being a scientist and a skeptic really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Egnor’s latest post (as of this writing) at the Discovery Institute’s site starts off with “Darwinist Dr. Jerry Coyne,”.  Really?  Darwinist is the first word he chose to describe Dr. Coyne?  Not professor, biologist, geneticist, author, etc.?  For that matter, what if Dr. Coyne accepts Einstein’s theories? Why not Einsteinist?  Nope, Darwinist.  Why?  Because ID proponents have taken over the word, twisted it, and made it out to be a pejorative term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well I, for one, am not going to sit by and take it.  I accept the current theory of evolution, does that make me a Darwinist?  I say, sure, why not? Why can’t we take it back, make the word mean something positive rather than having the negativity currently associated with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I sit here on the 200th anniversary of Darwin’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publishing of The Origin of Species, and I can proudly say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Mike.  And I am a Darwinist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get out and celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of one of the most important scientists of all time, Charles Darwin, and the 150th anniversary of the publication of one of the most important books in biology, &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life&lt;/i&gt;. It's that day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in Minnesota, and you have a couple of options here. The Bell Museum in Minneapolis is having a party!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin Day Party&lt;br&gt;
Thursday, February 12, 2009, 7 to 9 p.m.&lt;br&gt;
Bell Museum Auditorium&lt;br&gt;
$10/ free to museum members and University students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speakers will present in the auditorium from 7 to 8 pm. Birthday cake and refreshments are served after the presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birthday! Part of a world wide celebration, the Twin Cities' version is at The Bell Museum of Natural History this Thursday night. Join in the fun with cake, drinks and presentations by U of M scientists and educators. They will present funny, outrageous and controversial rapid-fire, media-rich presentations about Darwin and evolution. From the big bang to the human genome, hear the newest research and controversy on evolution and Darwin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m rather far from Minneapolis, unfortunately — if you live in the west central part of the state, or the eastern part of the Dakotas, we&amp;#39;re having an open lecture here at the University of Minnesota Morris. Nic McPhee of the computer science discipline and PZ Myers of biology will be talking about &amp;quot;Paths to Complexity: How Biology and Computation can Build Intricate Processes and Systems&amp;quot; — it&amp;#39;s a kind of anti-intelligent-design talk that focuses on the amazing stuff we do know about how chance and selection can build complex systems and efficient solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be on the UMM campus in HFA 6, at 5pm this evening. No charge, but come early — we expect to fill the joint up. If you can&amp;#39;t make it, it is going to be recorded and a podcast made available later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>PZ Myers</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://pandasthumb.org/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://pandasthumb.org/atom.xml</id><title type="html">The Panda&amp;#39;s Thumb</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234445753466"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-5381555998719413962">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8637019d020e7adf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Miscellaneous" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">The Coyne paradox.</title><published>2009-02-12T12:58:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T13:19:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/Lmm0LFNsjnI/coyne-paradox.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=5381555998719413962" title="8 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/coyne-paradox.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">From everything I have heard, Jerry Coyne's new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Evolution-True-Jerry-Coyne/dp/0670020532/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1234443874&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is very good.  I haven't read it yet (it is on my list), but I am willing to assume that the reviews have been reliable and that he makes a superb case for the fact of evolutionary descent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I don't understand is the consistent contradictions that seem to come up whenever I encounter his writings.  For example...&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He co-authors a very useful book on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speciation-Jerry-Coyne/dp/0878930892/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1234444695&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Speciation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is considered an expert on the topic.  But the book includes almost nothing about punctuated equilibria (i.e., one of the major issues with regard to patterns of speciation in the fossil record), and he even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/loom/2008/01/24/hopeless_monstersa_guest_post.php"&gt;misconstrues it as saltationist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of macromutational hopeful monsters, or "saltations," had a prominent resurrection in 1980 when Stephen Jay Gould, as part of his and Niles Eldredge's theory of punctuated equilibrium, proposed that macromutations could explain the "jumps" in the fossil record. After getting a severe drubbing from geneticists, Eldredge and Gould retreated in 1993, claiming that they never suggested the idea of saltations.    &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[See rebuttals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/01/macromutations-and-punctuated.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/01/punctuated-equilbria-is-not.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He writes a book about the evidence for evolution, but he also was one of the people responsible for &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6706/full/396035a0.html"&gt;undermining the peppered moth example&lt;/a&gt; in a strange book review.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Until now, however, the prize horse in our stable of examples has been the evolution of 'industrial melanism' in the peppered moth, &lt;i&gt;Biston betularia&lt;/i&gt;, presented by most teachers and textbooks as the paradigm of natural selection and evolution occurring within a human lifetime. The re-examination of this tale is the centrepiece of Michael Majerus's book, &lt;i&gt;Melanism: Evolution in Action&lt;/i&gt;. Depressingly, Majerus shows that this classic example is in bad shape, and, while not yet ready for the glue factory, needs serious attention.  &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;[See &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/h7n4r6h026q1u6hk/?p=084856cd393b4baba558312736d2249e&amp;amp;pi=6"&gt;Majerus's paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold"&gt;E:EO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; about this]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;He is a vocal critic of creationists, but he also defends the use of their favourite term &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/darwinism-must-die/"&gt;"Darwinism"&lt;/a&gt;.  Biologists rarely use it anyway (because, as I and many others feel, it is &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/n47h34357743w4p0/?p=084856cd393b4baba558312736d2249e&amp;amp;pi=9"&gt;misleading both historically and scientifically&lt;/a&gt;), so this can only provide benefit to anti-evolutionists.  He also doesn't seem to grasp that it's not that eliminating the term would cause creationists to vanish, it's that they would no longer have the (let's face it, effective) tool for persuading non-scientists that evolution is an ideology based on one man's teaching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/Lmm0LFNsjnI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234445753466"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-7400964135844921350">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2c4434d76ad8fb63</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Darwin" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Happy Darwin Day -- Remember, it's not just about Darwin.</title><published>2009-02-12T11:43:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T11:51:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/vV8rCdFns5Y/happy-darwin-day-remember-its-not-just.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=7400964135844921350" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/happy-darwin-day-remember-its-not-just.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Happy Darwin Day!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By which I mean, Remember one of the greatest scientists who ever lived AND all the accomplishments of the thousands of scientists who have come after him and made modern evolutionary biology the great success that it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me, this is not unlike celebrating nation-founding anniversaries (July 4 in the US, July 1 in Canada, etc.).

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Darwin is credited with the first known English use of 144 different words, including &lt;em&gt;creationist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;phylogeny&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;archaeopteryx&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;alfalfa&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;rodeo&lt;/em&gt;. And his birthday-mate Lincoln? Only one: &lt;em&gt;Michigander&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more about it in my &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/1720/"&gt;Word Routes column&lt;/a&gt; on the Visual Thesaurus.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Since there were some inquiries in the comments, I've appended the full list of words for which the OED gives Darwin as the first cited author. One of them turned out to be a false positive, so the list is down to 143.]&lt;/p&gt;

People are stupid.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;- Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones), &lt;em&gt;Men In Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of &lt;a href="http://www.getbetterhealth.com"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; know how passionate I am about protecting the public from misleading health information. I have witnessed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org//?p=238"&gt;first-hand&lt;/a&gt; many well-meaning attempts to “empower consumers” with Web 2.0 tools. Unfortunately, they were designed without a clear understanding of the scientific method, basic statistics, or in some cases, common sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first say that I desperately want my patients to be knowledgeable about their disease or condition. The quality of their self-care depends on that, and I regularly point each of them to trusted sources of health information so that they can be fully informed about all aspects of their health. Informed decisions are founded upon good information. But when the foundation is corrupt - consumer empowerment collapses like a house of cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is growing support in the consumer-driven healthcare movement for a phenomenon known as “the wisdom of crowds.” The idea is that the collective input of a large number of consumers can be a driving force for change – and is a powerful avenue for the advancement of science. It was further suggested (in a recent lecture on Health 2.0), that websites that enable patients to “conduct their own clinical trials” are the bold new frontier of research. This assertion betrays a lack of understanding of basic scientific principles. In healthcare we often say, “the plural of anecdote is not data” and I would translate that to “research minus science equals gossip.” Let me give you some examples of Health 2.0 gone wild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. A rating tool was created to “empower” patients to score their medications (and user-generated treatment options) based on their perceived efficacy for their disease/condition. The treatments with the highest average scores would surely reflect the best option for a given disease/condition, right? Wrong. Every single pain syndrome (from headache to low back pain) suggested a narcotic was the most popular (and therefore “best”) treatment. If patients followed this system for determining their treatment options, we’d be swatting flies with cannon balls - not to mention being at risk for drug dependency and even abuse. Treatments must be carefully customized to the individual - genetic differences, allergy profiles, comorbid conditions, and psychosocial and financial considerations all play an important role in choosing the best treatment. Removing those subtleties from the decision-making process is a backwards step for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. An online tracker tool was created without the input of a clinician. The tool purported to “empower women” to manage menopause more effectively online. What on earth would a woman want to do to manage her menopause online, you might ask? Well apparently these young software developers strongly believed that a “hot flash tracker” would be just what women were looking for. The tool provided a graphical representation of the frequency and duration of hot flashes, so that the user could present this to her doctor. One small problem: hot flash management is a binary decision. Hot flashes either are so personally bothersome that a woman would decide to receive hormone therapy to reduce their effects, or the hot flashes are not bothersome enough to warrant treatment. It doesn’t matter how frequently they occur or how long they last. Another ill-conceived Health 2.0 tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to interpreting data, &lt;a href="http://getbetterhealth.com/good-science-makes-bad-television-and-other-truths/2007.12.18"&gt;Barker Bausell&lt;/a&gt; does an admirable job of reviewing the most common reasons why people are misled to believe that there is a cause and effect relationship between a given intervention and outcome. In fact, the deck is stacked in favor of a perceived effect in any trial, so it’s important to be aware of these potential biases when interpreting results. Health 2.0 enthusiasts would do well to consider the following factors that create the potential for “false positives”in any clinical trial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Natural History&lt;/strong&gt;: most medical conditions have fluctuating symptoms and many improve on their own over time. Therefore, for many conditions, one would expect improvement during the course of study, regardless of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Regression to the Mean: &lt;/strong&gt;people are more likely to join a research study when their illness/problem is at its worst during its natural history. Therefore, it is more likely that the symptoms will improve during the study than if they joined at times when symptoms were not as troublesome. Therefore, in any given study - there is a tendency for participants in particular to improve after joining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  &lt;strong&gt;The Hawthorne Effect&lt;/strong&gt;: people behave differently and experience treatment differently when they’re being studied. So for example, if people know they’re being observed regarding their work productivity, they’re likely to work harder during the research study. The enhanced results therefore, do not reflect typical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Limitations of Memory&lt;/strong&gt;: studies have shown that people ascribe greater improvement of symptoms in retrospect. Research that relies on patient recall is in danger of increased false positive rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Experimenter Bias&lt;/strong&gt;: it is difficult for researchers to treat all study subjects in an identical manner if they know which patient is receiving an experimental treatment versus a placebo. Their gestures and the way that they question the subjects may set up expectations of benefit. Also, scientists are eager to demonstrate positive results for publication purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Experimental Attrition&lt;/strong&gt;: people generally join research studies because they expect that they may benefit from the treatment they receive. If they suspect that they are in the placebo group, they are more likely to drop out of the study. This can influence the study results so that the sicker patients who are not finding benefit with the placebo drop out, leaving the milder cases to try to tease out their response to the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; I saved the most important artifact for last. The natural tendency for study subjects is to perceive that a treatment is effective. Previous research has shown that about 33% of study subjects will report that the placebo has a positive therapeutic effect of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the often-missing ingredient in Health 2.0 is the medical expert. Without his/her critical review and educated guidance, there is a greater risk of making irrelevant tools or perhaps even doing more harm than good. Let’s all work closely together to harness the power of the Internet for our common good. While research minus science = gossip, science minus patients = inaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about you check out the Brand New edition of &lt;a title="free!" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/v6167602g164/?p=071f38dabe04459e8f12387817174cd3&amp;amp;pi=0"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/a&gt;, which has a special Darwin Edition?   I especially liked this &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/cg80506823661247/fulltext.html"&gt;essay on Darwin&lt;/a&gt;, which comes close to how I feel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have been most intrigued in the past few years with the young Darwin—the young man with only rudimentary training and only the simplest of scientific equipment, who travelled on the H.M.S. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beagle for ne&lt;/em&gt;a&lt;em&gt;rly 5 years (1831–1836) around the world….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darwin’s passion for his work—and, more deeply, for life itself—shines brightly throughout his diary, letters, and notes on the Beagle. …Most famous, of course, is his written cry “The mind is a chaos of delight” as he recorded his thoughts and feelings when   at last he glimpsed a true tropical rainforest—in Bahia, soon after the Beagle reached Brazil in 1832. The Bahian forest was the prototype for his “entangled bank” passage in the last, reverentially poetic   paragraph in On the Origin of Species published 27 years later.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;And, excited as he was to experience first hand the wonders of South American ecosystems, its species of animals and plants,  its fossils—in Darwin’s head there lurked a quieter, careful, analytic mind…&lt;br&gt;
Darwin is all of us, as we seek to do our creative best no matter what our path in life—and above all in maintaining our very passion for life itself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. what he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Today we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin, probably the greatest of all the scientists that the UK ever produced.  (I know, it depends a lot on how you rank Newton.)  Here at Edinburgh we celebrate Darwin as one of our own, and there will be several different events this afternoon.  Darwin started as an undergraduate here.  (Hated it — said his geology lectures were deeply boring.  Whenever I go off to teach a class here, I keep that in mind.  Don&amp;#39;t be boring.  You don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s out there among the undergraduates.)  He was getting nowhere with the plan to get a degree in medicine, and went away to Cambridge to study theology (astonishingly, he was going to become a country vicar in the Church of England!).  But he had joined a student natural history society at Edinburgh, and did other biological work as well, and when he eventually became a full-time (though unpaid and non-professorial) biologist in later life, and developed the radical idea of the gradual evolution of species through natural selection, his devout wife was a bit shocked, but told him he should not suppress his scientific ideas because of her faith.  Now &lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt; is my ideal of the right attitude toward free speech.  Respect me, and whatever religious faith I may have; but know that my beliefs don't override your right to hold and express your opinions, no matter what they are. Darwin's wife Emma truly heard the music.  She understood what linguistic, intellectual, and religious freedom should really mean in a diverse and democratic society. And whatever the polemics Darwin was exposed to, despite the formally theocratic nature of the British state (where the monarch also leads the established church), he was never exposed to legal threat for his expression of his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;, 11am EST: &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/11/autism.vaccines/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A special court ruled Thursday that parents of autistic children are not entitled to compensation in their contention that certain vaccines caused autism in their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN reports that a ruling on three test cases about the claim that vaccines can be linked to autism will be announced today. Thomas Powers, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, informed CNN of the ruling in the Vaccine Court &lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/omnibus-autism-proceeding"&gt;Omnibus Autism Proceeding&lt;/a&gt;. Some 4800 families have filed claims that vaccines somehow contributed to their child being autistic under the &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/Vaccinecompensation/"&gt;National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program&lt;/a&gt; (VICP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what the US Federal Court of Claims ruled, you can be sure there'll be a blog-o-bath of commentary. Indeed, there already has been (&lt;em&gt;n.b., &lt;/em&gt;the following tip-of-the-iceberg selection of blogging on this topic is based on what some deem to be a "biased" perspective because as &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/now_how_can_people_believe_that_about_vaccines"&gt;previously stated on this blog&lt;/a&gt;, the evidence refuting a vaccine-autism link &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/new_study_on_vaccine_safety"&gt;keeps growing&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

And, &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/162/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, she lists &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/162/"&gt;her articles&lt;/a&gt; on the Autism Omnibus Proceeding as well as on vaccine-injury and thimerosal legialation. Insightful commentary, as well as transcripts of the &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/06/cedillo-v-hss-vaccine-hearing.html"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; of the proceedings (here's &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/06/cedillo-v-hss-vaccine-hearing.html"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;), can be found at &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/06/cedillo-v-hss-vaccine-hearing.html"&gt;Autism Diva&lt;/a&gt; (and that's only one day; here is &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2007/06/omnibus-hearing-kinsbourne.html"&gt;more testimony&lt;/a&gt;). Kev at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=562"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; has numerous posts (&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=562"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;'s on the "expert," Vera Byers) and a &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?cat=55"&gt;whole section&lt;/a&gt; of posts on the Autism Omnibus. And, of course, here's a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_when_you_dont_have_sc.php"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_the_difference_betwee.php"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; by Orac on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/"&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; weighing in on antivaccination lunacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/vaccine-court-day-1/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-vaccine-theory-goes-to-court/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; by me on my old blog, Autism Vox, including &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/myth-science-and-a-trial-vaccines-and-autism/"&gt;Myth, Science, and a Trial: Vaccines and Autism&lt;/a&gt; and another about &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/legal-standards-science-and-the-cause-of-autism/"&gt;legal standards and science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more good stuff out there and I suspect they'll be more by the end of the day, provided the three test cases are indeed ruled upon. And after that deluge is over, I just hope we're all not so washed out that we forget to talk about the things that really matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Prince Harry is being sent away to an &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/4597265/Prince-Harry-sent-on-equality-and-diversity-course-after-Paki-race-row.html"&gt;equality and diversity training course&lt;/a&gt; where perhaps he will at last learn that the royal family should avoid any use of offensive epithets for ethnic minority groups in the population over which they have hereditary rule.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) The Dutch far-right-wing politician Geert Wilders has been &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5712737.ece"&gt;denied the right to enter Britain&lt;/a&gt; to attend a screening of his anti-Muslim film &lt;i&gt;Fitna&lt;/i&gt; (it reportedly juxtaposes shots of the 9/11 attacks with quotations from the Qur'an), which a member of the House of Lords wants to screen for parliamentarians.  The refusal of entry is said to be because Wilders poses a danger to the public through the ferocity of his extreme anti-Islamic views (at least 79 preachers deemed to preach "hate" have also been denied entry to the UK under the same European Union law).  Wilders plans to fly in anyway, daring the authorities to "put me in handcuffs".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) The twentieth anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa condemning novelist Salman Rushdie to death for disrespecting Islam is causing some renewed discussion of the case.  At the University of Bristol broadcaster Kenan Malik and Professor Tariq Modood will &lt;a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2009/6168.html"&gt;debate limits on free speech in a multicultural society&lt;/a&gt; — both attacking the liberal left, but for different reasons (Malik thinks liberals have been complicit in gagging free speech; Modood them liberals of inconsistency and double-standards for not extending protection from offensive speech to religious minorities).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life struggles on in this peaceful but frozen country.  &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1124"&gt;Rowan Laxton&lt;/a&gt; is on bail.  Here in Edinburgh a light snow is falling outside, and as I sit at the laptop over breakfast in my kitchen posting about possible threats to linguistic liberty, so far the heavy footfall of police has not been heard on the stairs outside our apartment.

Darwin has been featured in numerous magazine , internet and televised specials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/12/darwin.gif" alt="" style="float:right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.darwinday.org" rel="external "&gt;What is happening in your area?&lt;/a&gt;  Here in New Mexico, we got an early start on Wednesday 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; with a splendid talk by &lt;a href="http://www.voyageofthebeetle.com/" rel="external "&gt;Anne Weaver&lt;/a&gt;, author of the young reader’s book “Voyage of the Beetle,” and an avid evolution educator.  Anne explained that most people of the time were mired in “Essentialism” - the idea that all things, including species, are immutable, unchanging “essences.”  She explained that Darwin came to realize that it was the individuals who stayed the same for most of their life, and had children that shared their characteristics.  Between individuals of the same species, however, there can be a lot of variation.  Species are not immutable; individuals vary; it is &lt;em&gt;populations&lt;/em&gt; that evolve, as natural selection shapes the aggregate gene pool. 
Of course, biology has advanced tremendously since Darwin’s publication of the Origin; but this cautious naturalist got the Big Idea right, and for that he is rightly celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in New Mexico, there are Darwin Day events this week at &lt;a href="http://www.unm.edu/~market/cgi-bin/archives/003560.html" rel="external "&gt;UNM (Albuquerque)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~biology/Darwin/" rel="external "&gt;NM Tech (Socorro)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://abqpeaceandjustice.org/calSE2009B.html" rel="external "&gt;those Freethinkers&lt;/a&gt;.  I’ll be talking about the Age of the Earth &lt;a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/~biology/Darwin/" rel="external "&gt;Friday 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, in Socorro&lt;/a&gt;- come on down!  I’ll be discussing how I helped &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/09/steve-steve-and-1.html" rel=""&gt;Professor Steve Steve disprove creationist flood theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is everyone doing to commemorate the day?&lt;/p&gt;

To anticipate Sye's argument, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/"&gt;http://www.proofthatgodexists.org/ &lt;/a&gt;and explore all avenues. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In answer to Sye's challenge, I will do the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) Argue as consistently as possible for an account of the laws of logic in a manner which is independent of the question of God's existence; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Offer critiques to the presentation of the argument in general. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before I begin, I would like to ask Sye's definition for the Laws of Logic, as this may vary from person to person even within Calvinism. Since Sye's case is very similar to the late Greg Bahnsen's presentation, I will assume similar meaning and intent with Sye's case, unless Sye first clarifies differences he may have with Greg Bahnsen. After making the post, I invite Sye and all other interested parties to participate in the commentary for critiques, or for a substantial counterargument, to create and link a blog entry on their own personal space. Until my argument is presented, I will not participate in this debate thread, so that my case may be viewed in its full, edited, and checked form, and not have any presuppositions imposed against its quality based on any informal pieces of my arguments I could offer right at this moment. For the rest of you, enjoy the predebate, the debate itself, and the post-debate, which is probably going to last until the server host explodes. Be warned, if there's one thing to be said about Calvinists, they will not yield and, in my experience, hardly ever avoid taking the last word. ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am looking forward to presenting my case. I have duties tomorrow, Friday, and Saturday, so I cannot guarantee a reply until Sunday evening; however, I will work as best I can to get out my counterargument earlier while maintaining the coherence and consistency that the Calvinists are sure to analyze ... quite heavily. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After this case I will turn to Dr. Edward Feser's argument for God's existence, as presented in his book "The Last Superstition." For fans of Dr. Feser, I am trying to figure out how to collect definitions for all of his terms and a formal presentation of the argument without extensively hunting through previous pages of the book, especially considering that I may lift the wrong notion out of context. Is this what is known as the "Vertical" Cosmological Argument? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be noted to both presenters that I am an amateur philosopher - my profession and my research involve mathematics, and I've only taken the equivalent of three hours less than an undergrad minor in philosophy. Thus, I ought to be regarded as untrained, and would plead that while details in my cases are welcomed to be criticized, goodwill should be assumed when formal philosophical rules are broken. Of course, I don't think I'll provide definitive refutations the first go-around, so the criticisms of especially both authors is not only welcomed, but encouraged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to all, and happy (free-)thinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

For instance &lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/02/11/the-audacity-of-doing-nothing/"&gt;The Audacity of Doing Nothing&lt;/a&gt; by Philip Greenspun, whose blog I enjoy, in which he opines that the government should more or less let our current financial woes work themselves out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know enough about economics to really have a strong opinion one way or the other there, but what really made me smile was this paragraph:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did these guys want the government to do?  Nothing, basically.  “Back in the 19th Century, there were a lot of steep crashes, guys got wiped out, and the economy came back quickly.”  What’s different now?  The government is a lot bigger and more powerful.  Rich companies and people can put some of their wealth into lobbying and demand that the government prevent them from getting wiped out (or at least slow the process).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circular pattern there is astounding. The government is choosing bold action over free capitalism because they’re being lobbied to do so by big corporations and extremely wealthy individuals, who are themselves the inevitable byproduct of capitalism. If Greenspun is right, the market is preventing itself.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our nation has been locked for decades in a never-ending argument of big government vs. free capitalism. Is it possible that the latter must always lead to the former? Wouldn’t a free market always spawn corporations and robber barons who would then use lobbying bucks to influence government to create regulations in their favor? Anti-lobbying regulations are nothing but market regulations, since they effectively control where a corporation can or cannot invest. Perhaps a free market is a self-defeating concept, destined, in the event one should ever form, to wink out of existence in a few nanoseconds like a tiny black hole in a particle accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234419505271"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=3204">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5a2c67c85f6bb5e3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Social Media Strategies for Employers and Organisations: Suggestions for LBC and Global Radio</title><published>2009-02-12T05:19:38Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T05:19:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/12/social-media-strategies-for-employers-and-organisations-suggestions-for-lbc-and-global-radio/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">We strongly recommend that LBC and Global Radio should consider the useful United States Air Force blog assessment chart that provides guidance on how to react to blog posts.

He's done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has now officially degenerated into a liberal version of Rush Limbaugh, except that Rush Limbaugh is occasionally funny. Maybe he's more like Sean Hannity, particularly in his apparent dedication to the truth, or, rather, lack thereof. Hannity detests liberals and will immediately attack on the slightest pretense, even if the information given to him of "liberal wrongdoing" is dubious or outright wrong. Like Hannity, Olbermann will never turn down an opportunity to attack Bill O'Reilly or his paymaster Rupert Murdoch. Somtimes it's justified, but dubious reasons don't stop him from letting "Bill-O" or Murdoch have it with both barrels. The following is one such example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, I rather used to like Olbermann's broadsides against Bill O'Reilly, for example, when he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/oops_he_did_it_again_1.php"&gt;took down Bill O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt; for blaming the Malmedy massacre on American troops. Of late, I had become less enamored of his "Worst Person in the World" schtick (and, let's face it, schtick it is) as he became seemingly more interested in entertainment and vindictiveness rather than accuracy. Indeed, when he was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/in_the_interests_of_bipartisan_annoyance.php"&gt;parodied by SNL&lt;/a&gt; a while back, I ate it up. Yesterday, I thought that he may have to some extent shown signs of perhaps starting to "get it" when he named the man who started the decade-long MMR scare in the U.K., Andrew Wakefield, as his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/andrew_wakefield_worst_person_in_the_wor.php"&gt;Worst Person in the World&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. Wakefield richly deserved such an "honor," given that his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;undisclosed conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt; uncovered by a British journalist named Brian Deer, his research incompetence, and, most recently also uncovered by Brian Deer, his &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/why_am_i_not_surprised_it_looks_as_thoug.php"&gt;scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt; that falsely implicated the MMR vaccine as a cause of a syndrome of regressive autism and enterocolitis launched an anti-MMR hysteria that drove vaccination rates over the last decade down to below herd immunity. As a result,  the measles has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;returned with a vengeance in Britain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too bad tonight Olbermann let himself be played like a fiddle by antivaccine propagandist David Kirby, the man who, with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., was instrumental in launching the American version of the MMR scare, namely the thimerosal/mercury scare that roared into the states in 2004 and is now maintained by Jenny McCarthy--still aided and abetted by David Kirby. No, Kirby played Olbermann like Itzhak Perlman playing a goddamned Stradivarius. Indeed, Kirby played on Olbermann's hatred of Rupert Murdoch, inducing him to embarrass himself so completely and utterly that I can never--ever--take Olbermann seriously again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

People have argued about how important this was in his development of the idea of natural selection, but there is no doubt that it was at least relevant in his explanation of the mechanism.  It is the first topic he discusses in the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;, and the only subject that he meant to cover in greater detail that he actually returned to in a later publication (the two-volume &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication&lt;/span&gt;, 1868).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wrote a paper about domestication and what it can teach us about natural selection for the recent issue of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/span&gt;, and I now see that Michael Purugganan and Dorian Fuller have authored a paper on this topic for the Feb. 12 issue of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Nature &lt;/span&gt;(Darwin Day).  I didn't know about their paper, so it isn't cited in my article, but I can at least give a link below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.drstreicher.com/about.html"&gt;Dr. Lauren Streicher&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Obstetrics+and+Gynecology"&gt;obstetrics and gynecology&lt;/a&gt; at Northwestern University’s medical school in Chicago, got a call from “The Oprah Winfrey Show” inviting her to discuss menopausal hormones with actress &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Suzanne+Somers"&gt;Suzanne Somers&lt;/a&gt;, she figured she’d better read Somers’s best-selling books on the subject. As &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Lauren+Streicher"&gt;Streicher&lt;/a&gt; worked her way through the first chapter, she started underlining every sentence she felt was inaccurate. “But pretty soon, I had to stop,” Streicher says, “because I was underlining almost everything.”The taping of the show, which aired Jan. 29, proved equally disconcerting. Somers, a self-styled hormone and anti-aging expert whose controversial books promise midlife women that they will feel young and sexy if they take unregulated hormone therapy (HT) in much higher doses and for much longer time periods than most experts recommend, was literally given center stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And apparently while Somers was given free reign to sell her magic nonsense as Oprah insisted everyone read her book, the actual medical experts were relegated to sitting with the audience to wait for Ms. Winfrey to call on them like they were in third grade before being allowed to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you thought this was a mere oversight on Oprah’s part, you should know that some doctors had contacted Oprah’s production team to air their complaints about what they saw as misinformation propagated 2 weeks prior during a show she did on hormone therapy. So they knew they’d screwed up before and yet instead of making up for it, showed that they simply do not care if the information they present is true or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found the program to be quite shocking, and full of audacious claims, not substantiated by evidence,” says &lt;a href="http://www.obgyn.net/meet.asp?page=/all_advisors/W_Utian"&gt;Dr. Wulf Utian&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecologist and consultant at the Cleveland Clinic and founder of the North American Menopause Society, who has also worked as a consultant to the pharmaceutical industry. “Oprah is the most influential woman in the world, and I don’t think she comprehends the amount of damage she has done to &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Women%27s+Health"&gt;women’s health&lt;/a&gt;. I came away feeling like Oprah really didn’t understand the issue. Personally, I feel like she has set us back 100 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those out there who have in the past questioned why I can’t stand Oprah Winfrey, here’s why. And Somers isn’t any better. That she has the arrogance to think she knows better than the entire medical establishment is absurd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other doctors, Somers says, simply don’t understand bio-identical hormones as well as she does, because they “don’t learn about them in medical school” or go to the alternative-&lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Medicine"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt; conferences she attends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She even uses a variation on the theme made popular by the anti-vaccination crowd when they chastize critics who aren’t “mommys” or who don’t have autistic children of their own, but Somers’ gambit is to chistize her male critics. . .all of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is particularly annoyed with the criticism of male doctors, saying they’ve never experienced &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/related.aspx?subject=Menopause"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, because a doctor who’s spent his entire adult life studying and practicing medicine doesn’t understand menopause. That’s like saying you have to have tried crack in order to have an informed opinion about it. That’s just absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

I correct it in this post below, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/12/kablam-satellite-collision-math-and-a-correction/"&gt;give details in the following post.&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow: &lt;a href="http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0902/11iridium/"&gt;two satellites have collided in orbit&lt;/a&gt;, destroying both. This is the first time such a major collision has ever occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satellites were &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com/satinfo.aspx?lat=0&amp;amp;lng=0&amp;amp;alt=0&amp;amp;loc=Unspecified&amp;amp;TZ=CET&amp;amp;SatID=22675"&gt;Cosmos 2251&lt;/a&gt;, a Russian communication relay satellite that’s been defunct for a decade, and an Iridium satellite, one of a fleet of communication satellites launched by Motorola in the late 90s and early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speeds involved are somewhat higher than your standard traffic collision. Satellites at this height above the Earth — about 800 kilometers — have an orbital speed of about 8 km/sec. &lt;del&gt;However, these two satellites were on similar orbits, tilted with respect to each other by about 12 degrees. If I have accurate numbers, the physics of the situation means the collision speed was about 1.5 km/sec or so, which is pretty dang fast.&lt;/del&gt; Because of the way orbits work, this is about the same as the actual collision speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been collisions in space before, but never from such large satellites — the Iridium bird was about 700 kg, and the Cosmos was about the same — and never resulting in a total wipeout like this. Again, if I have my numbers about right, the explosion resulting from the energy of impact would have been about the same as detonating &lt;del&gt;a ton&lt;/del&gt; 5 tons of TNT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. It’s easily enough to totally destroy both satellites, and in fact the U.S. Space Surveillance Network has detected a substantial amount of debris, at least 600 pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, that debris is expanding in a cloud, and is still too high to threaten the space station which orbits at less than half the height where the satellites collided… but eventually the debris will pass through the altitude of the ISS. It’s not clear yet how much danger the station is in. Satellites in similar orbits as the two that hit are in the most immediate danger, but again it’s unclear what will happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll post more as I get more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004441" title=""&gt;Individual Recognition in Domestic Cattle (Bos taurus): Evidence from 2D-Images of Heads from Different Breeds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to maintain cohesion of groups, social animals need to process social information efficiently. Visual individual recognition, which is distinguished from mere visual discrimination, has been studied in only few mammalian species. In addition, most previous studies used either a small number of subjects or a few various views as test stimuli. Dairy cattle, as a domestic species allow the testing of a good sample size and provide a large variety of test stimuli due to the morphological diversity of breeds. Hence cattle are a suitable model for studying individual visual recognition. This study demonstrates that cattle display visual individual recognition and shows the effect of both familiarity and coat diversity in discrimination. We tested whether 8 Prim'Holstein heifers could recognize 2D-images of heads of one cow (face, profiles, ¾ views) from those of other cows. Experiments were based on a simultaneous discrimination paradigm through instrumental conditioning using food rewards. In Experiment 1, all images represented familiar cows (belonging to the same social group) from the Prim'Holstein breed. In Experiments 2, 3 and 4, images were from unfamiliar (unknown) individuals either from the same breed or other breeds. All heifers displayed individual recognition of familiar and unfamiliar individuals from their own breed. Subjects reached criterion sooner when recognizing a familiar individual than when recognizing an unfamiliar one (Exp 1: 3.1±0.7 vs. Exp 2: 5.2±1.2 sessions; Z = 1.99, N = 8, P = 0.046). In addition almost all subjects recognized unknown individuals from different breeds, however with greater difficulty. Our results demonstrated that cattle have efficient individual recognition based on categorization capacities. Social familiarity improved their performance. The recognition of individuals with very different coat characteristics from the subjects was the most difficult task. These results call for studies exploring the mechanisms involved in face recognition allowing interspecies comparisons, including humans.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004451" title=""&gt;Compactness Determines the Success of Cube and Octahedron Self-Assembly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nature utilizes self-assembly to fabricate structures on length scales ranging from the atomic to the macro scale. Self-assembly has emerged as a paradigm in engineering that enables the highly parallel fabrication of complex, and often three-dimensional, structures from basic building blocks. Although there have been several demonstrations of this self-assembly fabrication process, rules that govern a priori design, yield and defect tolerance remain unknown. In this paper, we have designed the first model experimental system for systematically analyzing the influence of geometry on the self-assembly of 200 and 500 µm cubes and octahedra from tethered, multi-component, two-dimensional (2D) nets. We examined the self-assembly of all eleven 2D nets that can fold into cubes and octahedra, and we observed striking correlations between the compactness of the nets and the success of the assembly. Two measures of compactness were used for the nets: the number of vertex or topological connections and the radius of gyration. The success of the self-assembly process was determined by measuring the yield and classifying the defects. Our observation of increased self-assembly success with decreased radius of gyration and increased topological connectivity resembles theoretical models that describe the role of compactness in protein folding. Because of the differences in size and scale between our system and the protein folding system, we postulate that this hypothesis may be more universal to self-assembling systems in general. Apart from being intellectually intriguing, the findings could enable the assembly of more complicated polyhedral structures (e.g. dodecahedra) by allowing a priori selection of a net that might self-assemble with high yields.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004448" title=""&gt;Phytoliths Analysis for the Discrimination of Foxtail Millet (Setaria italica) and Common Millet (Panicum miliaceum)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and Common millet (Panicum miliaceum) are the oldest domesticated dry farming crops in Eurasia. Identifying these two millets in the archaeobotanical remains are still problematic, especially because the millet grains preserve only when charred. Phytoliths analysis provides a viable method for identifying this important crop. However, to date, the identification of millet phytoliths has been questionable, because very little study has been done on their morphometry and taxonomy. Particularly, no clear diagnostic feature has been used to distinguish between Foxtail millet and Common millet. Here we examined the anatomy and silicon structure patterns in the glumes, lemmas, and paleas from the inflorescence bracts in 27 modern plants of Foxtail millet, Common millet, and closely related grasses, using light microscopy with phase-contrast and microscopic interferometer. Our research shows that five key diagnostic characteristics in phytolith morphology can be used to distinguish Foxtail millet from Common millet based on the presence of cross-shaped type, regularly arranged papillae, Ω-undulated type, endings structures of epidermal long cell, and surface ridgy line sculpture in the former species. We have established identification criteria that, when used together, give the only reliable way of distinguishing between Foxtail millet and Common millet species based on their phytoliths characteristics, thus making a methodological contribution to phytolith research. Our findings also have important implications in the fields of plant taxonomy, agricultural archaeology, and the culture history of ancient civilizations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004437" title=""&gt;Ancient Horizontal Gene Transfer from Bacteria Enhances Biosynthetic Capabilities of Fungi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Polyketides are natural products with a wide range of biological functions and pharmaceutical applications. Discovery and utilization of polyketides can be facilitated by understanding the evolutionary processes that gave rise to the biosynthetic machinery and the natural product potential of extant organisms. Gene duplication and subfunctionalization, as well as horizontal gene transfer are proposed mechanisms in the evolution of biosynthetic gene clusters. To explain the amount of homology in some polyketide synthases in unrelated organisms such as bacteria and fungi, interkingdom horizontal gene transfer has been evoked as the most likely evolutionary scenario. However, the origin of the genes and the direction of the transfer remained elusive. We used comparative phylogenetics to infer the ancestor of a group of polyketide synthase genes involved in antibiotic and mycotoxin production. We aligned keto synthase domain sequences of all available fungal 6-methylsalicylic acid (6-MSA)-type PKSs and their closest bacterial relatives. To assess the role of symbiotic fungi in the evolution of this gene we generated 24 6-MSA synthase sequence tags from lichen-forming fungi. Our results support an ancient horizontal gene transfer event from an actinobacterial source into ascomycete fungi, followed by gene duplication. Given that actinobacteria are unrivaled producers of biologically active compounds, such as antibiotics, it appears particularly promising to study biosynthetic genes of actinobacterial origin in fungi. The large number of 6-MSA-type PKS sequences found in lichen-forming fungi leads us hypothesize that the evolution of typical lichen compounds, such as orsellinic acid derivatives, was facilitated by the gain of this bacterial polyketide synthase.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_123.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/S_EN_NMPBmQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234410823586"><id gr:original-id="http://scepticsbook.com/?p=545">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/067df5acbd3e0fbf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blog Matters"/><category term="announcements"/><category term="autism"/><category term="Ben Goldacre"/><category term="copyright"/><category term="Jeni Barnett"/><category term="LBC"/><category term="legal action"/><category term="MMR"/><category term="Quackometer"/><category term="Robert Common"/><category term="vicious"/><category term="Yasmin"/><title type="html">Jeni Barnett’s agent claims she was subject to personal and extremely abusive comments on her blog</title><published>2009-02-12T03:48:38Z</published><updated>2009-02-12T03:48:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/02/12/jeni-barnetts-agent-claims-she-was-subject-to-personal-and-extremely-abusive-comments-on-her-blog/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://scepticsbook.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2009/02/11/personal-comments-detract-from-original-mmr-lbc-debate/"&gt;story on journalism.co.uk from &lt;span&gt;Judith Townend &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;reports that Jeni Barnett has received ‘hundreds of extremely personal and abusive comments,’ says her agent, Robert Common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The comments] do not address the debate about the use of MMR and that is the reason for taking the comments off Jeni’s website,” Common said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeni invited people to join the debate about MMR following her controversial broadcast on January 7 th where she spouted misinformation about MMR, autism and vaccinations in general. However, comments posted disagreeing with her stance, no matter how polite, were quickly removed from her blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the comments left on the  journalism.co.uk blog make this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst I would not approve of any threatening or abusive comments, the vast majority left on Jeni’s blog were simple and robust criticism of her stance and behaviour. Plus the subsequent behaviour of LBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As so many people did take the time to explain quite carefully what was wrong, I have reposted these blogs and comments on &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/jeni-barnett-have-you-lost-something.html"&gt;my own site&lt;/a&gt;. Make your own mind up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Jeni, or her agent Robert common forgot about the internet cache, but Andy from Quackometer.net did not. He has posted all the comments, as they originally appeared for us all to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that surprised many people posting on this story, was Jeni’s somewhat hypocritical cry that these comments were abusive personal attacks. This is a bit rich when you consider she herself yelled over the top of Yasmin, now identified as an NHS nurse, then later referred to her as “vicious”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://thebiologista.blogspot.com"&gt;The Biologista&lt;/a&gt; Says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/2009/02/11/personal-comments-detract-from-original-mmr-lbc-debate/#comment-10060"&gt;February 11th, 2009 at 9:26 pm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Jeni herself described at least one of her pro-MMR callers “vicious” and has been very dismissive of all of her critics. Regardless of the evidence they produced or how mannerly they were, their concerns were regarded as “sarcasm”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Jones&lt;/strong&gt; Says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 11th, 2009 at 9:42 pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the messages have been saved and are on the Internet for all to see. None were personally abusive. On the other hand, Barnett described a perfectly reasonable and concerned nurse who called into the show as ‘vicious’, which is simply untrue. The transcripts are available, read them for yourself, see who’s indulging in personal abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the point Jeni. You can put all the spin on it you like but the facts remain. The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/rachiesyd"&gt;audio&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/lbc-mmr-jeni-barnett-an-early-day-motion-the-times-and-er-a-bit-of-stephen-fry/"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/jeni-barnett-have-you-lost-something.html"&gt;blog comments&lt;/a&gt; as they originally appeared are available for us all to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Ben &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/do-not-abuse-jeni-barnett-personally/"&gt;has issued a personal plea on his blog&lt;/a&gt; to not send abusive emails to Jeni following a phone call from the programme director of LBC.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, in my native California where it's certainly warmer temperature-wise, two families are taking another route to get insurance to provide for autistic kids: Today's &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/11/BA7815S4F2.DTL"&gt;SFGate&lt;/a&gt; reports that a class-action lawsuit has been filed against Kaiser Permanente, accusing the health maintenance organization of refusing to treat children with autism in order to save costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court, said Oakland's Kaiser Foundation Health Plan has a legal duty to treat autistic children but instead engages in "unfair tactics that include sham excuses, deliberate delay and other attempts to avoid its lawful obligations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit seeks class-action certification and an injunction ending the alleged discrimination. The plaintiffs are not seeking damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser is countering that the services sought by the two families are "educational" and should be pursued with school districts----an inadequate dodge of a response, if you ask me. While the treatments----such as speech therapy and ABA---that many &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/insurance_and_autism_not_just_for_aba"&gt;families have sought to have insurance companies provide for&lt;/a&gt; can be labeled "educational," I think it's time to understand that there's some blurring of the boundaries here. My son's received plenty of speech therapy and ABA at school here in New Jersey, and what he's learning through these are, I would have to argue, vital not only for his academic and cognitive growth, but for his health, from self-help skills to working on how to better communicate his anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, individuals on the spectrum and families are too used to getting &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_canadian_autism_climate_too_cold_for_comfort"&gt;frozen out&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to getting services. Some parents have told me about insurance companies and school districts working together to provides therapies for kids----how else can there be a warmer reception when seeking coverage for the needs of individuals on the spectrum?&lt;/p&gt;

Upon further thinking, most of us realize that this probably wouldn’t be all it was cracked up to be, but a few truly believe it to the core.  And then they sometimes pass this sentiment along to their bubble-inhabiting kids, who pass it to their kids, blah, blah, blah, and suddenly we have people living in the 21st century thinking that everything would be just perfect if we would all just go back to living like they did a couple of millennia ago.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so there’s pretty much no one out there advocating that we revert completely, but there are people and groups out there that seem to view many aspects of modern technology and thought, especially in the realms of medicine and culture, as detrimental to humanity.  Although they wouldn’t all put it this way, it boils down to people’s uneasiness over “playing god”; the idea that there is a certain Natural Order of Things with which we should not tamper.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of thinking becomes evident in a wide range of issues, spanning everything from medical research to the politics of homosexuality, and can run the gamut from vaguely annoying to flat out dangerous.  Several examples follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman Catholics denounce birth control pills (and in some cases attempt to refuse women their prescriptions at the pharmacy) because they believe the pill causes a fertilized egg to be unable to implant in the uterus, thus causing what they consider to be an abortion.  Regardless of the fact that most doctors don’t think this is the primary function of the pill (the consensus seems to be that it works mainly by suppressing ovulation—am I the only one who thinks it’s sad we still don’t know exactly how the female body works?), and the pretty well established fact that breastfeeding, an activity encouraged by the Church, creates precisely the condition in the uterus that they use as the basis for their hatred of birth control pills.  A family member once said, about me, “I wonder how many babies she’s killed [by taking the pill].”  One could ask her, “How many babies have you killed by breastfeeding?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Wisconsin couple will be on trial soon for the 2008 death of their preteen daughter, a diabetic who was denied medical care because her family belonged to a church that preached faith healing.  For them, any use of modern medicine is considered sinful.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another case I find perplexing is that involving end of life decision making.  I can’t understand why, for some, it’s not a moral imperative to intubate someone who is in a coma and will starve to death as a result, but once the feeding tube is in, to remove it is considered murder.  Both scenarios produce the same result, yet one is seen as natural death and one is considered homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common thread in all of these cases is the demonization of putting knowledge into action.  It seems that in each case, it is seen as acceptable to simply allow events to transpire as they will, or even to act ignorantly in “natural” ways, but the minute a person acts on knowledge to achieve a specific outcome, the act becomes immoral.  Under a bit of scrutiny, inconsistencies pop up all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think people have different levels of comfort with taking on responsibility.  People on the conservative (and I mean that in the original sense: being averse to change.  I am by no means trying to start a semantic political argument about mainstream conservatives and liberals) end of the spectrum seem to have a low tolerance for taking responsibility for actions in certain arenas.  They take themselves out of the equation, at least in their own consciences, by refusing to act and leaving it to god.  And for some reason it’s okay with them that their god chooses to act in such capricious and arbitrary ways.  I’d rather go with human knowledge and reasonable, appropriate action any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, not only is this type of thinking defeatist and backward-looking, I’d argue that it is in itself anti-humanity.  One of the things that makes our species unique is our ability to think and adapt quickly to new situations millions of times faster than evolution can. This is not to say that every human innovation is inherently good, but this same capability allows us to create and maintain a system of ethics by which to determine how best to wield the technologies we create.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are playing god, I’d hazard the proposition that we’re doing far better at it than god does.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234401018853"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/todays_carnivals_335.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e6de67537aa27fb0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-02-11T23:35:19Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T23:35:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/GgkH_dUumD0/todays_carnivals_335.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/todays_carnivals_335.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Linnaeus Legacy #16 is up on &lt;a href="http://seedsaside.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/linneaus-legacy-16/" title=""&gt;Seeds Aside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; CALL TO ACTION: Ask your Representative to oppose the H.R. 801 - The Fair Copyright in Research Works Act

&lt;p&gt;February 11, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee (Rep. John Conyers, D-MI) re-introduced a bill that would reverse the NIH Public Access Policy and make it impossible for other federal agencies to put similar policies into place. The legislation is H.R. 801: the "Fair Copyright in Research Works Act" (http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.801:).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All supporters of public access - researchers, libraries, campus administrators, patient advocates, publishers, and others - are asked to please contact your Representative no later than February 28, 2009 to express your support for public access to taxpayer-funded research and ask that he or she oppose H.R.801. Draft letter text is included below. As always, it's important to let us know what action you're able to take, via http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/action/log.html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H.R. 801 is designed to amend current copyright law and create a new category of copyrighted works (Section 201, Title 17). In effect, it would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Prohibit all U.S. federal agencies from conditioning funding agreements to require that works resulting from federal support be made publicly available if those works are either: a) funded in part by sources other than a U.S. agency, or b) the result of "meaningful added value" to the work from an entity that is not party to the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Prohibit U.S. agencies from obtaining a license to publicly distribute, perform, or display such work by, for example, placing it on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Stifle access to a broad range of federally funded works, overturning the crucially important NIH Public Access Policy and preventing other agencies from implementing similar policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Because it is so broadly framed, the proposed bill would require an overhaul of the well-established procurement rules in effect for all federal agencies, and could disrupt day-to-day procurement practices across the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Repeal the longstanding "federal purpose" doctrine, under which all federal agencies that fund the creation of a copyrighted work reserve the "royalty-free, nonexclusive right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work" for any federal purpose. This will severely limit the ability of U.S. federal agencies to use works that they have funded to support and fulfill agency missions and to communicate with and educate the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the NIH Public Access Policy, millions of Americans now have access to vital health care information through the PubMed Central database. Under the current policy, nearly 3,000 new biomedical manuscripts are deposited for public accessibility each month. H.R.801 would prohibit the deposit of these manuscripts, seriously impeding the ability of researchers, physicians, health care professionals, and families to access and use this critical health-related information in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All supporters of public access -- researchers, libraries, campus administrators, patient advocates, publishers, and others -- are asked to contact their Representatives to let them know you support public access to federally funded research and oppose H.R. 801. Again, the proposed legislation would effectively reverse the NIH Public Access Policy, as well as make it impossible for other federal agencies to put similar policies into place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support and continued persistence in supporting this policy. You know the difference constituent voices can make on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact Heather or myself anytime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draft letter text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Representative;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On behalf of [your organization], I strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 801, "the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act," introduced to the House Judiciary Committee on February 3, 2009. This bill would amend the U.S. Copyright Code, prohibiting federal agencies from requiring as a condition of funding agreements public access to the products of the research they fund. This will significantly inhibit our ability to advance scientific discovery and to stimulate innovation in all scientific disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most critically, H.R. 810 would reverse the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy, prohibit American taxpayers from accessing the results of the crucial biomedical research funded by their taxpayer dollars, and stifle critical advancements in life-saving research and scientific discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the NIH Public Access Policy, millions of Americans now have access to vital health care information from the NIH's PubMed Central database. Under the current policy, nearly 3,000 new biomedical manuscripts are deposited for public accessibility each month. H.R.801 would prohibit the deposit of these manuscripts, seriously impeding the ability of researchers, physicians, health care professionals, and families to access and use this critical health-related information in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H.R. 801 affects not only the results of biomedical research produced by the NIH, but also scientific research coming from all other federal agencies. Access to critical information on energy, the environment, climate change, and hundreds of other areas that directly impact the lives and well being of the public would be unfairly limited by this proposed legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Why you support taxpayer access and the NIH policy].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH and other agencies must be allowed to ensure timely, public access to the results of research funded with taxpayer dollars. Please oppose H.R.801.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="canada2" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/canada2.jpg" height="263" alt="a stark, distant, snow covered mountain scene, the tip of the Canadian flag is visible in the top right corner" width="350"&gt;In my introduction, I pointed out that the Government of Canada still uses the medical model of disability as a guide in creating education and policy around autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism parents (in other words, parents of autistic children) are faced with numerous fears about society and how it treats them and their children. No matter where parents lie along the spectrum of belief about autism, one feeling is common: parents and their children confront daily barriers to access in terms of accommodations and services. Feelings of isolation give rise to two distinct methods of advocacy: one from the medical/economic model which justifies that funds will be used on one type of therapy will render an autistic person more functional and “normal,” versus a social model which suggests that a variety of accommodations and supports be available for use that is suitable for the individual across their lifespan. The former suggests that ABI is an autistic child’s best chances of success. It used to be if it didn’t “work” by the age of six, the government thought it wouldn’t work at all. Today, these same parents who asked ABA to extend to the age of six, are now requesting it to age 21 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social model advances the notion that the attitude of “performing” like everyone else actually adds to more barriers. Inclusion suggests that autistic kids have the right to be in every school and they have the right to be understood and to access the assistance they require in order to function within these environments. Inclusion is also a model which asks society, in turn, to examine its thoughts and prejudices about disabled people which continue to perpetuate limited access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadians are undoubtedly afraid of the consequences and “burden” of autistic people on the Canadian economy because ABA groups had purported that autistic people cost Canadians 3.5 billion dollars a year. Nowhere in their advocacy have I seen what autistic people add or contribute to the Canadian economy.  When distilled, a model of catastrophe is used to argue for funding, and yet, this same use of doomsday language continues to segregate autistic Canadians from fully participating in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manner in which the ABA community in Canada advocates is significant inasmuch as it is comes from an historical framework. Since the beginning of the twentieth century we have concluded from a study done in British Columbia from 1870-1930 which deemed “mentally deficient” children as a “blight” and a “burden.” Children were forced into segregated systems because they were deemed less valuable and not normal. “First, while normal children were becoming to be seen less as economic units, the defective [bold mine] child was still being judged in economic terms.” This study (cited below), exhibits no stark contrast in how autistic children are referred to today among Canada’s ABA advocates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no question that whether one follows a medical model to advocate or a social model, the fact of the matter remains that the issues regarding the equal treatment of autistic Canadians continues to be ignored in favour of arguments based on old models. The Government of Canada has listened, however, to the ABA advocates to a large extent. It limits its funding in Canada to ABI services in the public school systems. The ABA advocacy movement has succeeded in getting limited subsidy for this specific service, although the level of subsidy and support varies from province to province. Still, while ignoring how autistic people describe their learning experiences, ABI is now the therapy of choice for our Government. Families have little choice if they choose a different path, and the issue of Inclusion is just being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speech language pathologists are rarely trained in using devices to help autistic people and they are not subsidized. Occupational therapy is also not subsidized unless families access specific autism centres where these services may be available with long waiting lists. Limited funds are available to autistic people for special devices. There are long waiting lists at centres like Bloorview MacMillan here in Toronto to rent them. Camps are also inaccessible. While Reach for the Rainbow tries to place a certain number of autistic children in camps each year with shadows, this programs fill in quickly. The camps will not consider taking an autistic child with their family-appointed assistant, even though that assistant is familiar and is as necessary, one might argue, as a seeing-eye-dog is for the blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents still work very hard to coerce program supervisors and schools to accept their children, as many of us see the value for every person, autistic or not, to be included. Adam’s peers have learned a lot and often go to him for knowledge they lack. His value is apparent to his fellow peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other choice is to be corralled to an autism program. In order to become designated as “special needs” in the public school system, parents and children wait for as long as eight weeks after the school year begins, to have a meeting to assess and classify that child as “special needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mother Felice in an autism article in Today’s Parent Magazine in November 2008, (a Canadian publication) said it well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After struggling in an integrated classroom, Felice and Christina are now bused to a school 40 minutes away that has an autism class with seven kids. They’re away from the kids in the rest of the school for most of the day. They’re integrated during phys. Ed, music and assemblies, but it’s not a huge amount of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of full inclusion, we have achieved a halfway compromise to do one-on-one programming, where teachers are often minimally trained about autism, with minimal, token integration. At several so-called Inclusive schools here in Toronto, I have viewed paper taped up against windows so that neither parents nor other children can view the special needs children while in their segregated classes. This is done, apparently, in the name of “distraction.” It is said to us that the kids can become distracted, but as I witness another Inclusive school in Toronto bus the disabled kids before or after the other students can see them, I have to wonder who is really being distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there are stories of triumph. No matter which political “side” we are on, the stories that bring us the greatest joy is when we’ve managed to find the people who believe in our children, no matter where they are. Of course, we are all working on getting our kids recognized and educated, as they need. I will be the first one in line (if I can squeeze in), to ensure that services are available for autistic Canadians and their families. Yet, we have an urgent priority to have autistic Canadians recognized as people-first – with inherent rights to participate on policy committees on autism, to head up autism organizations and not be used as token members of our boards. Only then will we be able to achieve the services, education and employment that autistic Canadians deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very pleased that the beginning of this happened on a recent CBC program titled Positively Autistic, which aired last Fall. The more of this kind of awareness and involvement from autistic adults, the more we can work together to ensure that we don’t miss the opportunity we now have to ensure that autistic Canadians have their needs met.&lt;/p&gt;

That their divine creator might have slipped up and stuck in some tissue that is less than perfect is anathema to them, and so we often encounter bitter denunciations of the whole concept of vestigial organs — organs which have a modified or reduced function, and which are largely superfluous. The best example is the human appendix, which can be snipped out and thrown away with the patient no worse for the experience (other than, of course, the general consequences of surgery). You can find many examples of creationists insisting that the appendix really is a an important organ, but I was just pointed to a &lt;a href="http://www.drdino.com/articles.php?spec=75"&gt;real doozy at Kent Hovind's site&lt;/a&gt;. This one had me laughing out loud before the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with the title: it is one of a series called "Things that make evolutionists look stupid". This particular article is about the appendix, and it starts out conventionally enough, for a creationist screed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years surgeons removed appendixes with the attitude that they had no function and were no serious loss. It is only fairly recently that it has been realized that the appendix has a number of functions, all of which are important. The appendix is an important part of our immune system. It is a germ free section of the dirtiest part of the body that helps the body produce antibodies and protects the intestinal tract from infection, It also is on the bottom of the only part of the intestinal tract where waste materials must move upward. The appendix performs an important role by creating fluids that force waste matter up this section of the intestines. Without an appendix we become more susceptible to a large number of diseases that are caused by bacteria and viruses, as well as to cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Furthermore, as Ian Taylor has pointed out, many of our alleged ancestors, including monkeys and apes do not have appendixes, while rabbits, wombats and opossums do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Vestigial&amp;quot; does not mean &amp;quot;functionless&amp;quot;. It means that it has become superfluous or reduced. The appendix is loaded with lymphatic and immune system components, but this is unsurprising: such tissues are scattered throughout the digestive system. The question is, why is this patch of lymphatic tissue associated with a little protrusion of the gut? The author&amp;#39;s explanations don&amp;#39;t work. The idea that it&amp;#39;s producing fluids to push the gut contents upward is novel, but ridiculous — it&amp;#39;s tiny compared to the volume of the colon, and can&amp;#39;t produce that much fluid. If you&amp;#39;ve ever seen the small intestine, you&amp;#39;d also know that the ascending colon isn&amp;#39;t the only part of the tract where contents must flow upwards. It also isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;germ-free&amp;quot;, which is a silly assertion—your gut contains somewhere around 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria. It's a great sloshing tube of culture media for happy microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the claim that it&amp;#39;s vital for health, I&amp;#39;ve seen a number of studies that look for statistical correlations between appendectomies and cancers, and even some experimental studies in animals where it was removed and outcomes measured against controls…and I&amp;#39;m sorry, I haven&amp;#39;t seen any suggestion that it had the effect described. The author would be better off moving to a more nebulous claim. I like the idea that it is the location of the soul, since I had mine removed when I was nine, and a few years later decided I was a godless atheist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know who Ian Taylor is, but he seems willing to make up facts. &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/vestiges/appendix.html"&gt;Other primates do have an appendix&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118493902/abstract"&gt;chimpanzees have even been known to develop acute appendicitis&lt;/a&gt;. The creationists just keep making stuff up! And need I add that up until now, he's been arguing that the appendix is an essential organ, and now he is (falsely) claiming that other animals don't need it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, this isn't the funny part. That was the boring typical part. Here's where I started laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would not offend the bought and sold fascists who regulate the health industry in America by offering medical advice, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait for it. You just know with a lead-up like that that what he is about to do is…offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;but I will relate alternatives to appendectomies that have worked for others without actually advising anyone to follow these procedures. Richard Schulze, the successful naturopathic doctor so hated by the FDA and AMA for being successful, has outlined the way that he has dealt with appendicitis, which I will outline here. Appendix problems are caused by poor diet and severe constipation. The first thing that he recommends is to immediately stop eating and get an enema. A high enema, or high colonic, is very much preferable. A series of regular rectal enemas may have to suffice, if the proper equipment is not available. The enema will relieve the pressure that has built up inside of the appendix. It might even be a good idea to start with a rectal enema and work your way up to a high enema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve noticed that quacks are often obsessed with sticking things up people&amp;#39;s asses. I detect some sublimation going on here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, he's not done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting is recommended to be done for a few days, during which time only juice or water should be drunk and some herbal laxatives. An appendix problem is much more serious if there has been a perforation. If there has been an infection caused by a perforated appendix, antibiotic-like herbs should be taken in very heavy doses. Purple coneflower (or echinacea, echinacea purpurea, pallida and angustifolia) and garlic (Allium sativum) are recommended. A light massage of the abdomen would help at this point, but it should only be done with great care, if there is inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy is actually prescribing enemas and herbs for a &lt;i&gt;perforated appendix&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final procedure is to apply castor oil packs 24 hours per day over the appendix. Only fresh caster oil should be used. Rancid castor oil can be more detrimental than beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, enough is enough. This is too silly, and going on much too long, especially for an article in which he says he isn't going to give medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, no. Here come the anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandra Ellis describes treating her daughter for appendicitis in which the appendix actually did appear to have ruptured.  She followed Jethro Kloss's advice  and used a lobelia poultice, which was supplemented by Christopher's formula that added ginger, slippery elm and mullein. She also used comfrey tea and herbal enemas, olive oil and lobelia poultices, chamomile tea, catnip tea, alternating cold and heat packs, and reflexology. Her daughter recovered without an appendectomy, and without any infection. She provides the following formula for a poultice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shut up. That's enough. I don't &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; any recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Mix 1 tbs. of granulated or powdered lobelia with a large handful of granulated or crushed mullein leaves, and sprinkle with ginger. Add water to the herbs and mix into a paste, adding powdered slippery elm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some doctors advise against using any type of laxative and suggest that this may cause a dangerous irritation of the appendix. This may be good advice, but these same doctors fail to suggest releasing pressure through the other end, which would precede the laxative and relieve most of the potential for a "dangerous" irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enemas…the creationists cannot resist them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get over an appendix problem, you must learn from the experience. Your eating habits should change and you should work to ensure that you remain regular. If you eat garbage that acts as intestinal glue, you get what you ask for. Most doctors have acquired the opinion that mutilation is the only option in the case of an appendicitis, and that without them death is inevitable. We can thank the stupidity of evolutionists for this harmful misconception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what I mean? This crank splutters out a bunch of nonsense about appendix function and phylogeny, then dedicates most of his article to tales of curing appendicitis with enemas and herbs, and then he closes by accusing evolutionists for promoting harmful misconceptions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's good for a laugh, but there is one useful bit of information here. Never turn your back on a creationist.&lt;/p&gt;

I've made a few good friends, acquaintances, and at least friendly occasional pen-pals from this effort; the owner of this blog is one, as well as Dr. Quentin Smith, NW Missouri Skeptic Society president Landon Hendrick (who takes a rare attitude on his Christ Myth convictions many Mythers need to study and emulate) and CodewordConduit over at reflectionsofthedamned.blogspot.com. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that's just the nonbelieving crowd - big named believers such as Bill Craig, Gary Habermas, Paul Copan, MaryJo and Roger Sharp, Veritas48 from Youtube, and even the controversially regarded Dr. James White and J.P. Holding, have all welcomed my attempt to approach the arguments as friends and scholars, despite my occasional slipups in my attitude. Today I was pleasantly surprised when Norman Geisler added me out of the blue as a friend on Facebook. Even the universally maligned Ray Comfort has taken time out to lend an ear to what I have to say. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing I've learned - when it gets down to the logic, even those who are very controversial on both sides of the coin will show their very best. I'm thankful to all these atheists and theists for helping me begin my seemingly insurmountable quest to analyze all the evidences while listening to me attempt to dismantle the arguments many of them have spent their lives formulating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, though, there are cases when I run across people from either side who, when relieved of all the masks, have not reflected properly on the important question of the evidences for and against Christianity. Instead of clear thought and thorough research, several old, refuted, and often horrific canards come out of the woodwork of their mind, and those who are bright enough to know better accompany these overworked and dried up arguments with often unwarranted, bitter anger. Unfortunately, I have encountered more of this on the nonbelieving side, to which I say: wake up! Freethought isn't the four bestsellers from the "Four Horseman" - it's many other less popularized but more thoughtful works, as well. It's odd that many believers know more nontheistic works than the newest crop of nonbelievers! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results are similar for the believing side, as well. Although generally kinder, hostility exists aplenty, some at a level too stunning to ponder for long. One need only visit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzGbSL7om5E to see the depths that a believer (who otherwise has some decent presentations of arguments for God) can fall despite their moral conscience. To those not well-read on the believing side, there's more than what your pastor told you - Craig, Plantinga, classic Aquinas, and many others will expand your philosophy, but as with atheists, you ought to read works which challenge these thinkers, also. One ultimately believes or disbelieves honestly through his or her own reason, not that of a Michael Martin or a N.T. Wright. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for the "top ten worst," I must first state that the following list represents my own opinion, and should NOT be regarded as a definitive statement of belief on the part of any other poster here on this blog. This is from my own experience and is a reflection of my own worldview. So take it with a pillar of salt, if not just a grain. :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TOP FIVE WORST THEISTIC ARGUMENTS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. "Atheists killed so many people this past century. Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao, ..." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While true, this argument presupposes that atheism in and of itself was responsible for their atrocities. But while some of these deaths indeed were due to participation in beliefs, such executions serve more as an autobiography of these dictators' worldviews in general. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one should, in the dictator's view, dedicate one's life to the State, then it would follow under their wicked conviction that those who dedicated their lives to God ought to die. But even in these cases where belief was the cause of their untimely death, the underlying worldview used atheism as a tool to further the overall dictatorial structure. Atheism, like any other claim on theism, should never be instigated as law. But it does not follow that there is something inherent in atheism &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;qua&lt;/span&gt; atheism which logically necessitates the murder of believers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. Pascal's Wager. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't have much to say about this argument, other than its presupposition that the Christian God is the only one to consider within the sole context of this wager. Many critics like to come up with cute additions, such as gods who would eternally reward nonbelievers, but the real axe to the head of the wager is that it fails to include Allah, a widely believed Deity Who punishes nonbelievers eternally as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that counterexample doesn't even concede internal Christian struggles, such as exclusive High Calvinism (the belief that only Calvinists will be Saved), Church of Christ exclusivity, denominations which lack belief in Hell, and so on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long ago I once heard an anecdote about a rather forward preacher saying that if he were God, he'd send "just in case" believers on the fastest bobsled to Hell. After all, escaping the possibility of Hell does not mean you follow what Christ gave as the Greatest Commandment - to love God with all one's being. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. "You have to believe in God - you don't think nothing made everything, do you?" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With apologies to my friend Mr. Comfort, this one's just a flat-out clunker, for it implies there was a time which nothing existed, followed by time in which the Universe began to exist. But there is no "time before time," since time is correlated one-to-one with the existence of the Universe! This fact is universally accepted by philosophers and scientists alike who have reflected on the question carefully. Even the greatest arguer for the Kalam Cosmological Argument, Dr. William Lane Craig, recognizes this despite the rhetorical appeal of the statement (1). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. The Watchmaker argument. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All right. This one's an argument I have to harp on my fellow skeptics about - it's bad, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;really&lt;/span&gt; bad, and nonetheless it seems, especially recently, like the ultimate argument to refute when discussing atheism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it still crops up, sometimes in its more applicable form (e.g. its cousin the Fine-Tuning Argument, seen most famously from Drs. Craig and Geisler, involving the universal constants and their narrow range for life; this is worlds better and more challenging, albeit faulty) but, for the novice apologist, it's still the old watch on the beach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem, of course, is that a watch by definition is a man-made object, a fact which, if unrecognized, of course ties the budding skeptic opponent in knots; however, once one realizes the trick of using a man-made object in a presentation of a hypothetical natural object of great structure, the argument can be slain with little effort. Many highly organized and complex structures are observed directly in nature - my typical example as a stormchaser is a classic springtime supercell, which, in some cases, may form from completely disorganized hazy soup to a finely stacked, rotating, platelike structure with distinct parts and functioning. At times, these natural structures may even pop seemingly from nothing to form a large and devastating tornado within half an hour. With meteorological knowledge of shear, atmospheric energy, frontal boundaries and drylines, lifting mechanisms, and many other detailed physical contributors, these extraordinarily complex phenomena can be accounted solely by the forces of nature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. "Hitler was an atheist! Einstein believed in God!" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guess what the top bad atheist argument will be? The description of these two assertions is right down there with their atheist brothers in horror. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TOP FIVE WORST ATHEISTIC ARGUMENTS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. "Stupid ignorant barbarians made it up a long time ago to explain stuff." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While valid rhetoric if stated properly, this version is what I've seen the most. Looking past the almost always inherent prejudice mixing up lack of cultural knowledge with lack of innate intelligence, the conclusion doesn't even follow from the statement. It's what's known as the genetic fallacy, or the logical error which associates a belief's truth value directly with the nature of those from whom the belief originated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. "There are no proofs for God. Therefore, God does not exist." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This would be like saying "there are no proofs for Fermat's Last Theorem. Therefore, it's false," which would've made a laughingstock out of any professional mathematician making such a claim before Wiles' proof. While I am not harmonious with its companion, now on buses in a city near you - "Therefore, God probably does not exist" (I personally gripe because of the inability to assess such probability meaningfully) - this statement at least does not commit the logical fallacy of the Argument from Ignorance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A companion statement is that one is not called upon to prove a negative. However, if it may be given to the theist that the Theistic God is not internally incomprehensible, and that the Theist has attributed observable evidence to this Deity, then if the atheist wishes to state that this God definitely does not exist, he or she &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;must&lt;/span&gt; attribute the Theists' given evidences to another cause. Otherwise, the skeptic in this case must claim the aforementioned position of agnostic-atheism. A more concrete example of what I mean is that it is possible to disprove logically that there exists a Jupiter-sized planet between here and Mars (assuming equivocation is not performed), for one may demonstrate that the "Jupiterists" evidences are not present, or in the case of, say, some gravity anomaly, that an entity other than a planet is the cause. This would logically prove the negative. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. "You're all atheists to Zeus, Thor, and all that; I just believe in one God less than you do." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is rhetoric that Dan Barker commonly uses in debates to get a chuckle from the crowd and loosen up the seriousness a bit. Incredibly, I've recently witnessed some atheists &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;using this as a proof that God doesn't exist&lt;/span&gt;. I will not name names, but one of these atheists was participating in a formal debate. While a cute icebreaker in the proper context (I once heard a theist counter with, "you're a theist like me; I just believe in one more god than you"), it is disappointing to see this crop up as an actual supposed argument. Remember, folks, an atheist is one who holds, roughly stated, that no gods AT ALL as so far defined, exist, NOT that one god in particular doesn't exist. Barker probably is aware of this and, again, just uses it as rhetoric - that's as most as it should be worth when you're not joking or illustrating a point. In and of itself, it's a category error if you use it as an official argument! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. "God can't exist. If He did, then could He make a boulder so heavy He couldn't lift it?" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a beast of a bad argument that just won't die, and it's usually stated with an air of triumph. This one's close to my own heart, because there's a post deep in the Secular Web archives a dozen years or so back, where I, as a new and haughty atheist and devout parrot of Ingersoll, confidently proclaimed this like one who is settling one of mankind's biggest questions and closing the books of the most important philosophers in history during a break between Abstract Algebra and Computer Science II. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The argument, of course, attempts to show that omnipotence is incoherent. I think I saw an attempt to sophisticate this argument long ago, but even if that could be done, the vast majority of theists this side of Cornelius Van Til don't hold God as being able to do the logically impossible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. "Hitler was a Catholic! Einstein was an atheist!" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing first place with bad theistic arguments are the two gentlemen who, among novices, seem to be the two top theologians of all time. Inevitably, it's one's religious worldview that always generates their respective theological conclusions, with Hitler always taking the opponent's side and Einstein always taking the side of the arguer. On Youtube, news talk shows, soundbitten radio programs, and in churches and skeptic meetings alike all across the world, the greatest authority of belief in God and the greatest authority of disbelief in God will almost always make an appearance in an uninformed discussion (and, shamefully, in many informed ones). And in every case, they become the ultimate paragons of their assigned beliefs - which may, 24 hours later in the same coffee shop chair but with a different know-it-all pontificating in it, switch completely in their nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just a shameful embarrassment. Not only does the conclusion not follow either way, but the transparency of bringing up these names for effect is clear. These men were not theologians, and even if they spent all their lives reading up on Warranted Christian Belief or the Impossibility of God or whatever, the actions which defined their lives do not in any way take away or add to the validity of the beliefs that they are for the moment assigned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep on trucking with as bad of arguments as you want, both sides of 'ya. But stop this one, okay? Einstein pleaded to not be brought up in this framework, and I'm gonna respect his wish from now on; Hitler, of course, deserves no mention for anything outside of the context of the study of man's inhumanity to man. Likewise, I'll duke it out if you think one of these bad arguments is better than I think --- as long as you're not gonna defend this one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if this blog ends up with hundreds of replies full of bitter debates on Hitler-believed-this or Einstein-believed-that, the tiny, far distant cry you'll all hear will be me when I recognize how inevitable Godwin's Law is. :) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;==========&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope you all had fun with the list - remember, it's just my opinion, and not necessarily that of the other writers here (I know in particular the prove the negative comment and the critique of the atheists killed x people last century comment are a bit like topic grenades, but just remember, this half of this post is meant more for fun than serious argumentation and criticism). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the spring and autumn of 1992, I was a chemistry graduate student starting to believe that I might actually get enough of my experiments to work to get my Ph.D.  As such, I did what senior graduate students in my department were supposed to do: I began preparing myself to interview with employers who came to my campus (an assortment of industry companies and national labs), and I made regular visits to my department's large job announcement binder (familiarly referred to as "The Book of Job").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What optimism my successes in the lab giveth, the daunting terrain laid out in "The Book of Job" taketh away.  It wasn't just the announcements of postdoctoral positions (which, I had been told, were how one was supposed to develop research experience in an area distinct from the one that was the focus of the doctoral research) that listed as prerequisites 3 or more years of research experience in that very area.  The very exercise of trying to imagine myself meeting the needs of an academic department looking for a certain kind of researcher was ... really hard.  It sounded like they were all looking for researchers significantly more powerful than I felt myself to be at that point, and I wasn't sure if it was realistic to expect that I could develop those powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was having a crisis of faith, but I was trying to keep it under wraps because I was pretty sure that having that crisis was a sign that my skills and potential as a chemist were lacking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/profiles_in_mentoring_dr_james.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/profiles_in_mentoring_dr_james.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/dYndCezyqxo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234385208448"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5942">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b147587f07c6193</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 02.11.09</title><published>2009-02-11T20:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T20:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5942" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4f278303ec34c4603662c97a63533b8c&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let me apologize that the article I’m referencing for today’s inquisition was featured on Oprah.com (though I found it on CNN).  However, I will personally vouch for the validity of the topic, at least in the business world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/20070904_woman_holding_a_no_sign_18.jpg" alt="20070904_woman_holding_a_no_sign_18" width="128" height="106"&gt;The article, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/worklife/02/10/o.saying.no.at.work/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Price of Saying No at Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, describes the lifestyle choice each person makes when drawing boundaries at work, and claims that those who get to the very top do so by &lt;em&gt;always saying yes&lt;/em&gt;. The conclusion is that very few people can have it all.  Most of us must make sacrifices in either our personal or professional lives to achieve a balance that is comfortable to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote that resonated with me the most was, “You know why I never say no? … Because I think about the consequences of someone else saying yes.”  I think this is a problem most upwardly mobile people face, unless their skillset is specialized, rare, and in-demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also suggests that these decisions can be harder for women than men, because women are traditionally expected to compensate for men’s absence at home, but the reverse doesn’t necessarily apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So…do you struggle to achieve or maintain a work/life balance?  And if so, where do you draw the line?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stacey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234383617173"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4148">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/69a6ef9d2a60fa8e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education and Legal" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Improving science education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Education"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Evolution"/><category term="evolutioneducationandoutreach" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Evolution: Education and Outreach"/><title type="html">New Evolution: Education and Outreach Online</title><published>2009-02-11T20:18:18Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T20:34:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/new-evolution-e.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new issue of &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/v6167602g164/?p=071f38dabe04459e8f12387817174cd3&amp;amp;pi=0" rel="external "&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach is now online&lt;/a&gt;.

Stewart and his research team do a good job of gathering and presenting  empirical support for  a theory involving ranked, violable constraints. Here's a screenshot that links to the full episode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=217702"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/dailyshow-ot.jpg" alt="Privacy &amp;lt; O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s need to know" width="400" height="332"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial cases are Lindsay Lohan, whom O'Reilly has no beefs with, some citizen from the Columbia Journalism Review who is somewhere to the left of O'Reilly politically, and Angelina Jolie, who was like Lohan until she barred O'Reilly from her movie set (or something), at which point she became like the journalism guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can be a little more explicit about the details of the OT analysis. Let's consider the people to be the inputs and O'Reilly's actions relating to them to be the outputs. Then we can use the standard tableau format. Here is the evaluation for the journalism guy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Input: &lt;em&gt;Journalism guy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center" valign="top"&gt;O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s learns what he &amp;quot;needs&amp;quot; to learn&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center" valign="top"&gt;Privacy&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/winner.png" alt="Winner" width="40" height="20"&gt;Ambush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="bottom"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="bottom"&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No ambush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="bottom"&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="bottom"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asterisk means &amp;quot;violation&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s learns …&amp;quot; is ranked above Privacy. Thus, any violation of &amp;quot;O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s learns …&amp;quot; is decisive. This guy gets ambushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Lohan vacuously satisfies the &amp;quot;O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s learns …&amp;quot;  constraint, so the lower-ranked constraint Privacy adjudicates, and the &lt;em&gt;No ambush&lt;/em&gt; move is the winner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Input: &lt;em&gt;Lohan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center" valign="bottom"&gt;O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s learns what he &amp;quot;needs&amp;quot; to learn&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align="center" valign="bottom"&gt;Privacy&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ambush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="bottom"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="bottom"&gt;*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="right"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/winner.png" alt="Winner" width="40" height="20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No ambush&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center" valign="top"&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of the clips inside the Daily Show segment, it sounds like O'Reilly has the constraints ranked the other way, with Privacy winning out in all cases. As is often the case with linguistic analysis, the full range of facts reveals something more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly suspect that &amp;quot;O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s learns …&amp;quot; is dominated by other constraints, but The Daily Show&amp;#39;s data doesn&amp;#39;t contain the crucial cases. Does O&amp;#39;Reilly ever hold back his crew despite a very real need-to-know pressure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If O&amp;#39;Reilly decides to pursue this research himself, he might title the paper using a quotation from the segment: &amp;quot;Cognitive dissonance and why I don&amp;#39;t experience it&amp;quot;. The ranking delivers perfectly consistent behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've skipped lightly over the details of how OT works. OT is mostly used for linguistic analysis, but it has nice applications elsewhere; Elan Dresher's &lt;a href="http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~dresher/col6.html"&gt;The rise of Optimality Theory in first century Palestine&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to go for more details.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Potts</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234378065653"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_canadian_autism_climate_too_cold_for_comfort_introduction">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/73a4273e4ee41ae1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Canadian Autism Climate: Too Cold For Comfort Introduction</title><published>2009-02-11T18:43:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T18:43:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_canadian_autism_climate_too_cold_for_comfort_introduction" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esteeklar.com"&gt;www.esteeklar.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;[Ed. This is part of our continuing series on international perspectives.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="canada1" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/canada1.jpg" height="233" alt="Canadian flag on a pole, fully unfurled against a clear blue sky" width="350"&gt;I hate to be typical, but I begin the Canadian autism story at the same place as every other autism story a parent will write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, what I call, “autism parents,” no matter where we fall on the political autism spectrum, meld together. We all have that universal critical juncture at the time of the autism diagnosis, when are expectations are shattered and an opportunity to forge a new reality begins. It is usually at this point that our journeys may seem similar but can really take off in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the story begins like this: Our children were born, they seemed to develop “normally,” many were deemed anxious by ourselves and our pediatricians as we woke up umpteen times in the night, battling the fatigue of yet another challenging day of trying to “engage” our children in the games that were familiar to us, or soothing their anxiety or tantrums. Instead, we wondered if they were instead geniuses (learning letters and numbers early if they are hyperlexic), if they were deaf (if they didn’t respond), and by the time we expected speech, if something was seriously “wrong.” We simply weren’t sure what we were dealing with. Either by conversation with friends or through a hyper media campaign telling us we have to prevent autism or cure it, or other popular media throwing around the word autism like ADD was once thrown around (s/he is so ADD" to “he’s acting autistic today"), implying that autism is something terribly “wrong,” we got our kids the formal diagnosis through doctors, psychologists and other “autism experts.” As long as children fit within the recent criteria of “symptoms” or “indicators,” as recently drafted in the Diagnosis Statistical Manual as 1993:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)	Impairment in social interaction and communication;&lt;br&gt;
2)	Repetitive behaviour&lt;br&gt;
3)	Obsessive…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, our children were bonefied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the entry point into the foray of autism, what lies ahead is largely dictated here in Canada of what the government dictates is the proper autism “intervention.” Based on the notion that autism is a disease or something “wrong,” the government of Canada continues to endorse an intervention promoted by a series of parents in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This government-stamped intervention is Applied Behavioural Analysis or ABI (Applied Behavioural Intervention). Based on a history of viewing cognitive disability as an illness, a human deficiency, and of treating Canadians with cognitive disabilities as less than human in our own history, the Canadian Government has continued to base its autism policy not in the social model, but in this deficiency or medical model. As a result, we have continued segregation of autistic citizens in every aspect of our communities, no matter how hard we try to employ the principals of diversity and Inclusion. As long as we continue to view autistic people as requiring an intervention to make them “better,” our system can never claim that it accepts diverse citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next post will examine the current autism climate in Canada.

Not an enormous change, you might think, but these things don't happen without a Design Process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://web.mac.com/arnold_zwicky/pepsilogochange.gif" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Webster has &lt;a href="http://andstillipersist.com/2009/02/the-pepsi-universe/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on the Pepsi Logo change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;according to &lt;a href="http://bunnitude.com/misc/files/pepsi_gravitational_field.pdf"&gt;this document&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.arnellgroup.com/"&gt;the Arnell Group&lt;/a&gt;, the product design firm involved, the new Pepsi logo is based on extensive analysis not just of all previous Pepsi logos and trade dress, but also of fundamental design principles and the creation of the universe itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought that the design document was a parody of advertising talk (a very elaborate parody, granted, with lots of complex graphics), but the Arnell Group's webpage has more of the same, so the design document might well be genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;From the webpage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arnell is a multi-disciplinary brand and product invention company that executes across every consumer and trade touchpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnell's mission is to create incremental growth and provide shareholder value to our clients and partners through intellectual property revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more, but this was as much as I could bear to type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Webster's picks from the design document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment in our DNA leads to breakthrough innovation and allows us to move out of the traditional linear system and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vocabulary of truth and simplicity is a reoccurring phenomena in the brand’s history. It communicates the brand in a timeless manner and with an expression of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotive forces shape the gestalt of the brand identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attraction Theory: The Pepsi Proposition&lt;br&gt;
Establishment of a gravitational pull to shift from a “transactional” experience to an “invitational” expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is an interesting question, and one that I have faced since my college days of standing on the stoop debating creationists who decided to bang on my door to spread their faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer is this - it depends upon what your goals are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals in debating creationists have always primarily been understanding the scientific and logical issues. I want to understant what the creationist’s arguments are. It turns out, their arguments are all terrible. It is therefore interesting (at least to me) to drill down to determine exactly what the malfunctions are in their arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationist arguments are a veritable textbook of logical fallacies. They also abuse science in just about every possible way, and are always looking for new ways. The tactics of evolution-denial employed by creationists crop up in other forms of denial and pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it is a good exercise to ask yourself questions such as - how solid is the evidence for a particular claim, what is the nature of scientific evidence, and when is a scientific theory established enough to be considered a fact. Also - are historical sciences legitimately scientific, which gets to the question of what constitutes science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I find debating creationists has deepened my knowledge of evolution. This is not necessary, and I have studies evolution in the classroom and on my own completely separately from the question of creationism. But, debating creationists has been an exercise in probing for any weaknesses in my understanding and holes in my knowledge about evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also forces you to be very precise and specific - for example, we cannot really talk about “evolutionary theory” as if it is one thing. Evolution contains several sub-claims that need to be dealt with individually - common descent, natural selection as a dominant mechanism of change, and the specific evolutionary history of life on earth, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore I admit that a primary motivation for me to engage with creationists is selfish - to improve my understanding of evolution, science vs pseudoscience, and logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly debating creationists is a more complex question. If the goal there is to show to the public that creationists arguments are all vacuous, and evolution is a solid scientific theory, then public debates are very tricky and can easily backfire. I would stay away from them unless one is very confident, not only in their knowledge of evolution, but their knowledge of creationist arguments and their debating skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, and open-ended debate is probably a losing proposition. They tend to energize the creationists and stir up trouble. Also, even a good debater will be vulnerable to the Gish-Gallop - throwing out numerous misconceptions each of which take much more time to correct than create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public spoken debates should therefore have a clear purpose. They should also be focused and moderated - not open-ended. This means that the debate can be focused on specific points to sufficient depth to deal with them, and will at least limit the ability of one side to avoid points against them by simply shifting to new points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much better than spoken debates are written debates. In a written venue arguments can be laid out in far greater detail. It is easier to keep the focus on specific points, and to provide references to back up factual claims. You can keep people to a higher standard of scholarship in writing, and often more time is available to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of public written debates can be to help educate the public about the issues and the science. It is a very useful form of education. It also provides an accessible answer to creationist misinformation they are placing on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also a useful format for exposing all the logical fallacies and deceptive debating techniques used by creationists (or anyway trying to defend a false and intellectually bankrupt position). Take John Andrew (truthseeker), for example. Yesterday I challenged him to answer to a very specific claim and line of evidence. His response was classic. He failed to address my question. Instead he replied with a series of non sequiturs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked about the origin of life and the universe, which has nothing to do with the evidence for common descent. He replied, essentially, “well, scientists don’t know everything.” He then followed up with a vague reference to authority - there are other people, he assures us, who are smarter than him who could answer my question. He does not name these mystery experts nor point to their alleged answers to my challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then finished off with Pascal’s wager - if he’s right, he warns us, then we risk eternal damnation. Of course most readers saw right through such scare tactics - what about the other hundred or so faiths in the world?  And even still - this is a discussion about scientific evidence, not about faith. We care about what is the best scientific conclusion, not covering our existential bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our little exchange exposed the tactics of John quite clearly, and now there is a written record that anyone can see. I gave a specific and polite scientific challenge with detailed evidence and logic, and he responded by dodging the scientific debate with a string of non sequiturs. This is particularly satisfying as he has been crowing here and on his blog that “Darwinists” refuse to deal with his challenges and simply want to insult him. He is essentially guilty of doing exactly what he accuses others of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting back to the original topic of this blog entry - the purpose of debating creationists, I will conclude with one final point. The purpose of such debates is not, and has never been, to convince the creationist one is debating. That is almost always (being generous with the almost) a pointless exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been a semi-privileged, middle class, male Caucasian all of my life, but now, thanks to &lt;a href="http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/goodbye-spry-codgers-so-long-feisty-crones/?hp"&gt;The New Old Age&lt;/a&gt; I’ve discovered that I too am a card-carrying member of a group that is besieged by politically incorrect language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.aging.org/i4a/store/category.cfm?category_id=4"&gt;stylebook for the media &lt;/a&gt;now shows how writers and broadcasters can avoid being sued for discrimination by, uh, well, er, whatever we’d rather be called (hint: it isn’t the e word). I’ll bet that this book will be cited in a slew of forthcoming lawsuits on age discrimination. &lt;em&gt;Elderly &lt;/em&gt;is out, along with &lt;em&gt;senior citizen, golden years, feisty, spry, senile, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;grandfatherly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I understand ageism these days, I’m even supposed to be offended if someone says that I’m &lt;em&gt;seventy-eight years young&lt;/em&gt;.  Okay, I know about the more obvious ageist words, like &lt;em&gt;codger, old fart, geezer, old goat,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fossil,&lt;/em&gt; but the insult of adding &lt;em&gt;years young&lt;/em&gt; to my age mystifies me.

I mean the case of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/beyond_sad"&gt;Trudy Steuernagel and her son, Sky Walker&lt;/a&gt;. Steuernagel, a professor of political science at &lt;a href="http://www.kent.edu"&gt;Kent State University&lt;/a&gt;, died last Friday from injuries from a beating by 18-year-old Walker. Walker, who's described as "severely autistic," is now being held on a $2 million bond of two charges, attempted murder of his mother and felonious assault on the police officer who found him in the basement. A story in &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/AutismNews/story?id=6848289&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt; today tells a lot more about mother and son. This part really hits home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...she was always "Sky's mom" ahead of being Dr. Steuernagel. Even though Walker would never be able to achieve what her students had, Steuernagel delighted in what he could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Trudy wouldn't have traded any of those bad moments at all," [Molly Merryman, a friend and Kent State University associate professor] said, "for being Sky's mom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just that I'm a professor with a son on the autism spectrum like Steuernagel. No matter what, I'm a mother first---yes, "Charlie's mom" before being "Professor Chew"---and I indeed would never trade in a single "bad moment" for being my son's mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like Sky Walker, my son who's not even a teenager yet is bigger and stronger than me. He has been too big for me to scoop up in my arms since he was about 7, really; Charlie was a big baby and I always knew that the days when I could carry him away from any trouble would be finite. I've tried to take that knowledge and do the right thing by Charlie, to teach him how to deal with the distress, anxiety, frustration, that pepper his days and that he communicates only partially through words. Jim and I know that, as parents, hard choices are upon us, as we think about Charlie's future, the likelihood of him being six feet tall one day, and both of us getting older ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just can't stop thinking about Sky Walker in the totally unfamiliar environment of a jail, without the one person who was his companion and support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about what happened to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm grateful I'm able to rush home in a few hours, to see the yellow school bus and Charlie in the front right window, peering out at me from under the hood of his blue sweatshirt, and his lighter blue coat whose sleeves are already getting too short.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234370320402"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/it_would_be_nice_to_white_out.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6dd285f2f3d6845</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">It would be nice to white out this map</title><published>2009-02-11T15:31:19Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T15:31:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/De7kug3nWvo/it_would_be_nice_to_white_out.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/it_would_be_nice_to_white_out.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's an interesting Gallup poll that &lt;a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/114211/Alabamians-Iranians-Common.aspx"&gt;compares religious fervor between nations&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a quick summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religiosity is correlated with poverty — the poorer you are, the more godly you are. I guess God really does like that poverty thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US is not the most religious nation, not by a long shot — we are well below the median. It is, however, an outlier, as the most religious &lt;i&gt;wealthy&lt;/i&gt; nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is wide regional variation within the US. Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina are like poor Middle Eastern or African countries; Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are like middle-of-the-road European nations, in terms of their religiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/religiosity_nations.jpeg" width="425" height="294" alt="religiosity_nations.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect there has to be a dangerous cycle imbedded in these relationships. Poverty leads to more religiosity as people reach for desperate hope; and religion does nothing to solve real problems, leading to worsening poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

If you polled physicists to find out who they thought had been the most influential American scientist doing research in general relativity over the past several decades, Thorne would win hands-down.  (Here’s a &lt;a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2007/nov/the-man-who-imagined-wormholes-and-schooled-hawking"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Discover&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you dropped the delimiter “American” from the question above, the winner would undoubtedly be Stephen Hawking.  So we’re very happy to have a guest post from Kip, announcing an upcoming talk by Hawking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————————————————————————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hawking is coming to town - to Pasadena, that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caltech, in Pasadena, California, is Hawking’s home away from home.  Since 1991 he has spent roughly a month a year here as our Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar.  This year he flies in from his English home at the end of February, then heads off to Texas in early April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He arrives with an entourage of five care givers to tend to his physical needs, one or two family members, several graduate students, and a “graduate assistant” who handles logistics and serves as general fixit-person for his computer system and mechanized wheel chair.  His current chair is new and sophisticated.  At the flick of a switch,  its hydraulics can lift him up to a standing person’s eye level or slide him down near ground level for high-speed chases —  he has been known to take pleasure from running over the toes of university presidents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawking’s Pasadena sojourns are rather like Einstein’s in the 1930s.  Caltech is an intellectual magnet - a crossroad for ideas about the cosmos and the fundamental laws of nature, which are Hawking’s passion.  He contributes mightily to the ferment, and partakes.  Our California night life (LA, not Caltech!) is also pretty good; and Hawking, like Einstein, is a party animal,  only more so.  During his annual month here, my own social life intensifies five-fold just from being his closest California friend.  He loves opera, theater, jazz clubs, barbecues that he hosts in the patio of his Pasadena home, and dinners with fine wine - especially an Indian Feast prepared for him by Caltech undergraduates.  Yes, we geeks can cook up a storm - well, not me, but the younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversation with Stephen is slow,  about 3 words a minute, produced by Stephen moving a muscle in his face (imaged by a lens and photodetector) to control a cursor on his computer screen.  It’s slow, but rewarding.  You never know, until his sentence is complete, whether it will be a pearl of wisdom or an off-the-wall joke.  Faster speeds are on the horizon:  &lt;a href="http://www.braincommunication.org/"&gt;computer control via brane waves&lt;/a&gt;, without drilling a hole in his head (he’s opposed to that).  But he resists changing technology, even without drilling, until forced to.  “I can’t believe it’s as good as what I have.”  (It actually is; my wife has a friend with ALS who proves it so.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Hawking’s Pasadena time is spent thinking, conversing, and working on projects.  Jim Hartle drives down from Santa Barbara to continue their &lt;a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/0803.1663"&gt;decades-long research collaboration&lt;/a&gt; on the birth of the Universe.  Leonard Mlodinow, a Pasadena-based free-lance writer, toils with him  on a book: in the past, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Briefer-History-Time-Stephen-Hawking/dp/0553804367"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Briefer History of Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; now, their forthcoming &lt;em&gt;The Grand Design&lt;/em&gt;.  And there are drives to Hollywood to film for &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; or the &lt;em&gt;Simpsons&lt;/em&gt; or the forthcoming &lt;a href="http://www.universepartners.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Hawking’s Beyond the Horizon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On each Pasadena visit, Hawking gives a lecture for the general public - always before in Caltech’s limited-seating Beckman Auditorium, but this year in the newly renovated Pasadena Convention Center, at 8PM, Monday March 9.  “Why We [the human race] Should Go into Space” is his title.  It’s an opportunity to see him in action, be immersed in his mind’s world, and - if last year’s lecture is any indication - participate in a happening.  Tickets are available from the Caltech ticket office, (626) 395-4652, at $10 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I saw Hawking speak to such a large audience, thousands, was in a converted railway station in Santiago Chile, soon after General Pinochet’s regime gave way to civilian rule.  It was quite a show.  Hawking made a grand entrance to rock music and charmed the crowd.  The President of Chile and other civilian officials sat on one side of the giant stage, the military brass on the other, with enormous tension between them; they were hardly speaking to each other in those days. Only Hawking could bring them into the same room.  His aura works magic.  The next day the military flew us to Antarctica: a C130 cargo plane filled with TV cameras, journalists and physicists.  It was August, the Antarctic winter, the first flight to Antarctica in more than a month due to winter storms.   It was a Hawking Adventure, one among many.  He lives life to the fullest.  He will fly on a rocket into space soon.&lt;/p&gt;

You may have heard of social Darwinism and eugenics. The former took Darwin's description of long-term biological change and applied it as a prescriptive excuse for not showing compassion to the poor and weak. The latter held that a species that was protected from selection pressure by such compassion would degenerate and all its members become weak. Both are thoroughly discredited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt; appeared 150 years ago in 1859. In 1900, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Montelius"&gt;Oscar Montelius&lt;/a&gt; published a richly illustrated 31-page paper in &lt;i&gt;Svenska Fornminnesföreningens Tidskrift&lt;/i&gt; 10 (fasc. 30) titled &lt;i&gt;Typologien eller utvecklingsläran tillämpad på det menskliga arbetet&lt;/i&gt; -- "Typology, or the theory of evolution applied to the work of humans". Montelius is known as the "Linnaeus of archaeology" and was one of the second-generation founding fathers of my discipline. Hugely prolific, much of his work is still read and cited, always being clearly argued. But in the case of his 1900 paper, Montelius made an uncharacteristic and unsuccessful attempt to latch onto one of his day's most-discussed scientific theories. (August Strindberg's famous 1888 play &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Julie"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miss Julie&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes similar use of social Darwinism.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Typology" has two distinct meanings. In theology, it refers to the idea that certain motifs in the Old Testament prefigure motifs in the New Testament, thus revealing God's great plan. (Most such parallels are of course extremely strained.) But in archaeology it refers to the classification and seriation of artefacts and structures. People are not boundlessly creative. Almost everything we make is very similar to something made before. These similarities allow us to date and interpret classes of finds instead of discussing every individual object on its own. Montelius's paper forms an introduction to the basic theory of archaeological typology as it was understood at the time. But where does Darwin come into it all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montelius wrote the paper as a presentation to the 15th Conference of Scandinavian Naturalists in Stockholm in 1898. A professor and celebrated public figure of 55 at the time, he most likely received an invitation to the conference and reached for the best way available to make his work relevant and comprehensible to the assembled naturalists. Montelius begins by stating that just as one species evolves from another, every archaeological object type is born of an earlier type. This, he knew, is not strictly true as a new archaeological type often shows similarities to several earlier types. But he was after all standing in front of a crowd of biologists and needed to connect with them. He then demonstrates two typological series where Bronze Age axe and sword types evolve through time to reach a greater level of practical perfection. The take-home message: object types change due to selection pressure from their modes of practical use and become optimised over time. My axe is a &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; axe than my granddad's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not quite true either, as Montelius knew. His series of sword grips does show one practical improvement in that the wielder's thumb receives better protection from the late types than from the early ones. But Montelius doesn't make this argument. He just takes the reader through a series of visual design changes without any apparent practical implications. My sword is not in fact much better than granddad's: it's mainly just &lt;i&gt;different because of fashion&lt;/i&gt;. And this is driven home even more forcefully by Montelius's next examples, where he presents two series of brooch types, all technically equivalent but aesthetically extremely varied. The last brooch in each series does not work any better than the first. Montelius also quotes Bernhard Salin at great length on the development of 1st Millennium animal art, where no practical selection pressure would be possible even in principle. Finally, he shows the retention in railway carriages of his day of non-practical design traits that only made sense as reminiscences of what horse-drawn stagecoaches had looked like almost a century before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So archaeological typology is not quite analogous to biological evolution. People will of course only make objects that work for their intended purposes (sometimes practical, sometimes not). But they will also design and decorate these objects according to whims of fashion and ideology that are best compared to genetic drift or null mutations in the context of biology. I don't want to sound like a panadaptationist, but most visible variation between biological species is at least adaptively relevant. Between object types, not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper contains only a few general appeals to biological theory and no references to the biological literature. Montelius mentions Darwin only once, on the last page (and I translate):&lt;blockquote&gt;"My having wished to speak at a meeting of naturalists about the typological method is not however mainly because of the importance of this method to the archaeologist, but rather, that it might be of some interest to the naturalist to see that we generally use the same method as he, -- in that we collect the largest possible body of evidence and order it in such a manner that the results immediately appear to the eye, -- and with reference to the theory of evolution, we are at a purely darwinian standpoint."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, all that Montelius had shown was that archaeological typology has descent with modification. But he failed quite ostentatiously to establish anything like adaptation through natural selection. That is not in fact the motor that drives change in material culture with all its kaleidoscopic complexity. The motor is immaterial culture, the culture of the mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/early_archaeological_darwinism.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/kwsrEvH-w30" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234368132491"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/11/wordhole/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eedd96d1970657bb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><title type="html">Wordhole</title><published>2009-02-11T15:38:06Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T15:38:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/11/wordhole/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;You may have seen links to this nifty thing called &lt;a href="http://www.wordle.net/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a &amp;quot;tag cloud&amp;quot; out of words; an image of the words where the size of the word displayed is scaled to how many times it appears in the text.

Dates and times are reckoned locally; they are relative to a location and depend on conventions for labeling spans of time (via time zones and the like). These conventions allow us to say that Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln were born on the same day, 12 February, meaning that it was 12 February in Shropshire when Darwin was born there and 12 February in Kentucky when Lincoln was born there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it's Thursday 12 February throughout Australia, though it wasn't when I started writing this posting.

&lt;p&gt;Let me back up a minute. One of the most common beliefs among users and advocates of "complementary and alternative" medicine (CAM) is that supplementation with vitamins will have all sorts of beneficial health effects. True, this belief is also pervasive among people who wouldn't go to an acupuncturist if you held a gun to their head, but it has become most associated with CAM. That this is so can actually be viewed as evidence of just how successful CAM activists have been in completely yoking all manner of lifestyle interventions to prevent or treat disease as somehow being "alternative" rather than, as they really are, science- and evidence-based. Of course, diet and exercise are the Trojan horse that CAM advocates hope to get the guardians of scientific medicine to bring into the fortress. When that happens (actually it is happening), diet and supplement warriors will leap out and open the gate of the castle to let in all the woo whose practitioners have coopted potentially science-based lifestyle interventions. One thing that should be noted is that in CAM world, diet and exercise are often not considered enough. No, it's not considered adequate to eat enough fruit and vegetables and to avoid fatty foods. Oh, no. You also have to swallow all manner of vitamin supplements, because, or so we are told, they will prevent all manner of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept that vitamin supplementation might prevent cancer is not in and of itself an unlikely idea. Diet has a powerful effect on health, and it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that supplementation with certain vitamins might have beneficial health effects. For example, although I used to be very skeptical about it, I'm starting to think that there  might just be something to the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation can decrease the risk of colon and breast cancer if the appropriate amount is taken to raise the blood level to a certain range. (Perhaps that will be the topic for another post, but in the meantime &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/aspx/blog/Comments.aspx?id=217"&gt;Dr. Len&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2008/12/10/does-vitamin-d-protect-against-cancer/"&gt;Ed Yong&lt;/a&gt; have written good primers on the suggestive but muddled state of the evidence with regard to whether vitamin D prevents breast cancer.) While I haven't gone whole hog and started advocating that my patients take vitamin D supplementation, given that it's pretty clear that a certain target blood level must be not only reached, but verified, or started taking it myself, I certainly will if more evidence clarifies the picture better. In fact, from my perspective, the case for vitamin D is actually harmed by idiots like Mike Adams routinely &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/vitamin_d_and_cancer_the_difference_betw.php"&gt;bringing home the crazy&lt;/a&gt; by painting it as some sort of miracle vitamin that prevents and cures all manner of cancer, because his infectious idiocy is tainting what may well be a science-based preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other studies of vitamins and cancer have been a lot more disappointing. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/another_one_bites_the_dust_clinical_tria.php"&gt;One recent study&lt;/a&gt; examining the effects of selenium and vitamin E on preventing prostate cancer had to be stopped early because there was no benefit and a hint that there were more cancers in those taking vitamin E and more diabetes in those taking selenium. And just this week, a new study has been published that has also found no benefit in preventing cancer or heart disease due to routine vitamin supplementation. The study, using data from the Women's Health Initiative and entitled &lt;a href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/169/3/294"&gt;Multivitamin Use and Risk of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease&lt;/a&gt; also found no benefit from multivitamin supplementation in overall survival.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/bummer_about_them_vitaminsagain.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/bummer_about_them_vitaminsagain.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/3KHpENdtc2A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234366673797"><id gr:original-id="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=306">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad26b376fae533f1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kudos"/><category term="Narrative"/><title type="html">Wakefield named Worst Person in the World</title><published>2009-02-11T15:36:30Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T15:36:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=306" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://autism-news-beat.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Thus, it comes as no great surprise that he is comfortable with equating evolutionary biology and Darwinism. Here&amp;#39;s what he writes in defense of Carl Safina&amp;#39;s New York Times article [Darwinism must die????].Well, how much confusion has really been caused by using the term “Darwinism”?

The algorithm was originally presented in Katerina Frantzi, Sophia Ananiadou, and Hideki Mima, &lt;a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/sophia.ananiadou/IJODL2000.pdf"&gt;Automatic recognition of multi-word terms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Digital Libraries&lt;/em&gt; 3(2): 117-132, 2000. You can try it out on a site at the National Centre for Text Mining (&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;amp;start=1&amp;amp;q=http://www.nactem.ac.uk/&amp;amp;ei=ncmSSdXzBZW6twed8I3SCw&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEt_ZyTVdhl5MtFlg_A3t8HUp1eXA"&gt;NaCTeM&lt;/a&gt;) at the University of Manchester in the UK, where they have a &lt;a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/"&gt;web demonstration&lt;/a&gt; that will analyze short (&amp;lt;2 MB) texts or URLs for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you'll find if you try, the results are not always perfect, but I think that the algorithm is remarkably good at guessing multi-word terms from small amounts of text. For example, if I try it out on a page (~2000 words) of lecture notes about "&lt;a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs502/LNRE.html"&gt;Statistical estimation for Large Numbers of Rare Events&lt;/a&gt;", it comes up with a large number of sensible things like &lt;em&gt;good-turing estimate&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;maximum likelihood&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;population frequency&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;belief tax&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;negative binomial distribution&lt;/em&gt; — along with a few clunkers like &lt;em&gt;cnew = cnew./token&lt;/em&gt; and some other fragments of Matlab code. (Maybe it was unfair to give it a sample that included such things…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nactem.ac.uk/profile.php?member=jmcnaught"&gt;Jock McNaught&lt;/a&gt; recently reminded me of this service by trying it out on President Obama's inaugural address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jock wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;As I see there has been some discussion on the Language Log about Pres.  Obama's inauguration speech, and elsewhere David Crystal's excellent  analysis, I thought you might be interested to see what NaCTeM's TerMine  tool made of his speech, see attached.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I've seen some word clouds, some single word analyses, but haven't come  across any analysis of the compound words he used.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The output is ordered by descending C-value score, then within each  score by ascending alphabetic order.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;As the speech is a small sample, only the C-value scores &amp;gt;1 are really  relevant to indicating the &amp;#39;important&amp;#39; compounds. As you may recall,  C-value isn&amp;#39;t straight frequency of occurrence, it also takes into  account nesting of smaller forms in larger forms, length of forms, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I chose to focus here is on Adj N combinations, and lowercasing and  stemming were used in an attempt to improve results. Possibly of some  discourse-level interest is that there were very few 3-grams of  importance found and nothing at all by way of &amp;gt;3-grams, although I  haven&amp;#39;t checked to see if, statistically, the 3-grams found would  represent a typical proportion for this size/type of text. The tool does  not handle conjoined forms (i.e. of the &amp;quot;old men and women&amp;quot; variety).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the list that Jock attached:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Result of analysing President Obama's inauguration speech using NaCTeM's TerMine
tool.

The output is ordered by descending C-value, then within each score by ascending

Even among hard-nosed skeptics, this question is often perplexing. On the one hand, vitamins themselves were discovered by medical and biological science, they play a vital role (by definition) in the healthy functioning of our bodies, and deficiencies of vitamins can cause disease. So they seem perfectly legitimate. On the other hand the market is full of exaggerated and even magical claims about the cure-all power of vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult for people to come to a bottom-line conclusion - should they take vitamin supplements or not. Is it woo or not woo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well - it’s complicated. But there is large body of research to help inform our decisions about vitamins. Now, the largest study to date has been published (&lt;a href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/169/3/294?lookupType=volpage&amp;amp;vol=169&amp;amp;fp=294&amp;amp;view=short"&gt;Multivitamin Use and Risk of Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease in the Women’s Health Initiative Cohorts&lt;/a&gt;)  looking at 161,808 post-menopausal women over 8 years and finding no benefit for heart disease, cancer risk, or overall survival. This study comes on the heels of other recent studies showing no benefit from routine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The recent study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two components of this new study. The first pooled data from several trials where multivitamin use was tracked, and also randomized patients to dietary modification, hormonal therapy, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The second component of the study was an observational study - which means that multivitamin use was tracked but subjects were not randomized.  The study found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a median follow-up of 8.0 and 7.9 years in the clinical trial and observational study cohorts, respectively, the Women’s Health Initiative study provided convincing evidence that multivitamin use has little or no influence on the risk of common cancers, CVD, or total mortality in postmenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strengths of this study are its size and duration. Essentially the study had enough power to detect even a modest effect if present. The weaknesses are that the observational part of the study was not controlled. This opens the door to multiple factors that could influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have also charged that 8 years is no sufficient, as benefit from supplementation may manifest only over decades. This is true, but is a generic criticism that can be leveled against any negative study. It doesn’t change the fact that there is still a lack of evidence for routine supplementation. Also, I think that 8 years is a substantial follow up, so if there were a measurable benefit from vitamins this study was probably powerful enough to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another point, the study’s lead author, Marian Neuhouser, is &lt;a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090209/D968BGTG0.html"&gt;quoted as saying&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Get nutrients from food. Whole foods are better than dietary supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be true, but this is not something that can be concluded from this study.  Advocates for the preventive benefits of nutrition often make this claim - that nutrition from food is better than nutrition from vitamins. This is partly based on other observational studies that link a diet rich in fruits and vegetables with lower risk of heart disease and certain cancers. However, another way to interpret this discrepancy is not that vitamins from food are better than vitamins from pills but rather that vitamins are not what is healthy about such diets.  For example, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables may be healthy because it is not full of animal fat. Or, people who take care to eat such diets may also generally take better care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weakness of observational studies cuts both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routine Supplementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To back up a bit - let me say that I am a strong believer in good nutrition. From a basic science point of view, it just makes sense. We need specific nutrients for various biochemical reactions in our bodies.  Deficiencies are clearly related to specific diseases. Further, in areas where nutrition is poor overall development is also poor. The connection is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of routine supplementation, however, goes further. It asks whether or not taking vitamin supplements are necessary or helpful for someone who has a reasonable diet and does not have any specific disease or condition that would impact their demand for specific vitamins - i.e. routine. In most wealthy industrialized nations lack of quality food is not a problem for most people. Also, modern methods of growing, preserving, and shipping food means that more people have access to a wider variety of foods all year round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplement sellers have tried to perpetuate a myth that foods grown today lack key nutrients. There is just no evidence for this, however. The foods we have access to today have, if anything, superior nutrition to those of the past. Further, botique organically grown crops have only a minor advantage in nutritional content that is not likely to be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, lack of nutrition does not appear to be a problem for the industrialized west. The modern nutritional scourge is, rather, too much of the wrong kinds of food. This gets back to the point about diets rich in fruits and vegetables - their benefits may be more in what they do not contain than what they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the evidence supports the conclusion that for most people who have a reasonable diet there is no benefit from routine supplementation. Of course, what’s a “reasonable” diet? This opens the door for those who wish to take a multivitamin as “insurance” because they feel their diet is not very good. The evidence suggests that they would be better off having a healthy diet rather than living on steak and vitamin pills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While lacking evidence, the “insurance” argument is not entirely unreasonable. The advice I give my own patients who ask my opinion is this. If you feel you need a supplement because your diet is lacking than go ahead. But - do not take megadoses of vitamins, do not go broke on fancy expensive supplements, and do not use vitamins as an excuse to otherwise have an unhealthy lifestyle. And, in the end your are probably better off working on having a better diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Supplementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of what I said above has anything to do with targeted supplementation. I prescribe vitamins almost every day - for those with conditions known to be improved or prevented by specific vitamins or co-factors, and for those with a documented deficiency. For example, many patients with certain neurological diseases have low folate or vitamin B12 levels. So I check these frequently and supplement them if the levels are low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that vitamin B2 may improve migraines in some patients - so that is an option I offer migraine patients. B6 may improve recovery from nerve damage (but only at proper doses, megadoses actually causes nerve damage). And folate has been shown to reduce the risk of spinal cord defects, and so should be taken by any woman who might become pregnant (once you find out you are pregnant it’s too late).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, there has been much evidence recently about the value of vitamin D in preventing certain cancers and neurological disorders. It may be that the recommended daily allowances of vitamin D were too low, and they are being increased as new evidence comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted supplementation is evidence-based and specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a clear trend in the evidence we have to date. The benefits of routine supplementation are unproven. High doses of vitamins probably cause more harm than good. If you are concerned about your nutrition then improve your diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, as with good science-based medicine in general, questions must be specific. We should not ask - do vitamins work. Rather we need to consider specific supplementation in specific situations and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What may surprise members of the public who have been exposed for years to the propaganda of a supplement industry eager to take their money, or CAM proponents eager to appear legitimate - is that vitamins have always been part of mainstream science-based medicine. There is a tremendous amount of quality research to inform our conclusions about vitamins, and they are part of everyday practice.&lt;/p&gt;

His criticism of evo-devo, his opinion &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/01/punctuated-equilbria-is-not.html"&gt;that punctuated equilibria is saltationist&lt;/a&gt;, and his apparent belief that there is nothing new under the sun in evolutionary biology that is worth getting too excited about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also disagree that&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; “'Darwinism'” is a compact, four-syllable term for 'modern evolutionary theory'”&lt;/span&gt;.  No, it isn't.  It may be a synonymn for "adaptive change due to the process of natural selection", but even that would be stretching it.  There is a LOT in modern evolutionary theory that is well outside anything Darwin considered, and thus is not "Darwinism" in any sense.  Genetic drift, everything to do with mutation, allopatric speciation, mass extinctions, developmental regulatory genes, genome duplication, population genetics, the list goes on.  There is also a lot that Darwin considered, including use and disuse, pangenesis, and other components of what should also be included in "Darwinism", that are not part of evolutionary theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I repeat the advice given by Scott and Branch for historic, scientific, and practical reasons: &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/n47h34357743w4p0/?p=b92eaf8c7a5a4eccb52f94dde6cb99ee&amp;amp;pi=1"&gt;Don't call it "Darwinism"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;________&lt;br&gt;UPDATE: See also &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/jerry-coyne-on-darwinism.html"&gt;Larry Moran&lt;/a&gt;'s thoughts.&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/_hZIjEAQwfg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234353279003"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=2194">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f18e3379342e34c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="bigamy"/><category term="dyar"/><category term="history"/><category term="myth"/><title type="html">Insects, Bigamy, and History</title><published>2009-02-11T11:51:40Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T11:51:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/insects-bigamy-and-history/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millard Fillmore (or his bathtub, anyway) tagged me with a &lt;a href="http://timpanogos.wordpress.com/2008/03/01/tagged-by-myers-to-do-history-meet-james-madison/"&gt;historical meme&lt;/a&gt;. I’m supposed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;List 7 random/weird things about your favorite historical figure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag seven more people at the end of your blog and link to theirs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was tagged almost a year ago, I’ll pass on giving this chain letter to anyone else. But I will entertain you with some random facts about a favorite (and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; infamous!) entomological figure: &lt;strong&gt;Harrison G. Dyar &lt;/strong&gt;(1866-1929).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyar is one of the truly bizarre figures in Entomology. First a Smithsonian scientist– then dismissed over charges of bigamy— he ended his career as an editor of a &lt;a title="about Bahai" href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/bahai3.htm"&gt;Bahai&lt;/a&gt; religious journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many gentlemen scientists of the era, Dyar worked without pay, supporting himself with investments and his inheritance at the beginning of his career.  At the National Museum, he began to develop a name for himself working on mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While becoming a recognized expert, and eventually earning a salary from the museum, Dyar was also known for his (frequently public and published) arguments with other scientists.* One of his papers was titled &lt;em&gt;“New Facts That Are Not New”&lt;/em&gt;; a scathing criticism of amateur entomologists and their observations.  That should pretty much give you a sense of his temperament.  (And that was one of his nicer papers!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He developed what is now known as “Dyar’s Law”, which is &lt;a title="recent paper" href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;amp;cpsidt=13850959"&gt;still in use today&lt;/a&gt;.  He described the way in which larval head capsules grow geometrically with each instar (moult).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a recognized, if ill-tempered, expert in his field. And then…things went &lt;a href="http://bahai-library.com/?file=henson_harrison_dyar"&gt;horribly wrong&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Midway through his career, Dyar encountered problems in his personal life that had serious effects on his professional life. His marriage to Zella Peabody ended in 1915 amid charges of bigamy, and he was dismissed from the USDA for conduct unbecoming a government employee. It became known that in 1906 Dyar, using the alias Wilfred Allen, had married Wellesca Pollock, an educator and ardent disciple of the Bahá’í faith. They had three sons, whom Dyar legally adopted after he and Allen married legally in 1921.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A truck fell into a labyrinth of tunnels near Dyar’s old home in 1924… Eventually Dyar accepted responsibility for the tunnels and similar works behind his new home, saying he found relaxation in digging underground. The brick-walled tunnels extended for hundreds of feet and measured six by six feet.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dyar named a moth species &lt;em&gt;wellesca&lt;/em&gt; after the woman he married in 1906.   You’ll note this is 10 years &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; he got around to divorcing his first wife, Zella, whose name he later gave to another insect species in 1927.  I doubt she was appeased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what is said about Dyar is not actually true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although most stories suggest he was commuting between his two unsuspecting families underground, there is no evidence the tunnels connected his two homes, even though they were just blocks apart.  He really did just like to dig holes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dyar was, so the story goes, busted by his two sons comparing notes at school when they found they shared the same last name. “How odd! Your Papa’s an entomologist at the Smithsonian too!”  That also seems to be apocryphal–it’s apparently from the movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053214/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a different bigamist).  It just makes such a nice story that it’s still making the rounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s said that Dyar disliked lepidopterist John Smith, a large man…and named a species &lt;em&gt;corpulentis&lt;/em&gt; after him.  This does not appear to be true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This so so angered (so the story goes) Smith he named a genus after Dyar–&lt;em&gt;Dyaria&lt;/em&gt;, pronounced diarrhea.  This story is also, alas, not true. You can find it showing up in print pretty regularly, though, whenever the press covers funny species names.  It seems a different person intended to honor Dyar, but didn’t notice the double meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dyar is sometimes confused with another &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Gray_Dyar"&gt;H.G. Dyar&lt;/a&gt;, who developed the first US telegraph. That was the Entomologist Dyar’s father.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s your (in)famous entomologist. You can learn more about Dyar in the excellent paper (alas, not available online):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Despite the fact that &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; am also known for cranky, ill-tempered rants about others, that’s not why I’m fond of Dyar. Really!&lt;/p&gt;

Recovery can be difficult if the issues are not clear and you feel alone in the struggle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The “Release and Reclaim” weekend is a powerful group experience designed to support you in the process of healing and growth.  This includes sharing personal stories, examining key issues, exploring new liberating concepts, and taking part in experiential activities to move beyond intellectual analysis.  There will also be time for shared meals, relaxation, and fun. After the retreat, participants are encouraged to join the confidential online group for continued friendship and support. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These retreats are led by &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Marlene Winell, Ph.D.&lt;/span&gt;, psychologist and author of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Leaving the Fold: A Guide for Former Fundamentalists and Others Leaving Their Religion. &lt;/span&gt; Dr. Winell has a private practice in Berkeley, CA and also consults by telephone.

&lt;p&gt;I attach for your interest an excerpt from a recent complaint letter I wrote to London Stansted Airport after a friend of mine had what she felt was an unnecessarily rude experience at security, where amongst other things she was told she should have checked the airline security pages before travelling. Which she had actually done, with me present (to help as she is not a native English speaker, and a first time air traveller).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked the site again to help prepare the complaint, which only added to my ire when I discovered what is stated (in &lt;a href="http://www.stanstedairport.com/portal/page/Stansted%5EGeneral%5EAirport+information%5ESecurity+control%5EFAQs/385ea4775858d110VgnVCM10000036821c0a____/448c6a4c7f1b0010VgnVCM200000357e120a____/#9"&gt;these FAQs&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I noticed this interesting question on the FAQ: "&lt;span&gt;I need to carry a liquid wig spray. Can I have this in my hand luggage?&lt;/span&gt; Yes, up to 100ml, and it has to be presented in the transparent plastic bag."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234347607382"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_201.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7a73d5e1b74b2175</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-02-11T08:55:37Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T08:55:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/4uV9bJ8PHh0/clock_quotes_201.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_201.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In saying that without the power of the state, evil men would rule over the good it is taken for granted that the good are precisely those who at the present time have power, and the bad the same who are now subjugated.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

He was on an exercise bike at a gym in the Regent&amp;#39;s Park area of London, and he got angry as he watched film of the destruction in Gaza, and shouted: &amp;quot;Fucking Israelis!  Fucking Jews!&amp;quot; — adding that they should be &amp;quot;wiped off the face of the earth.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Laxton is head of diplomatic policy in South Asia at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the UK government.  He reports directly to brief the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband.  (In one of those twists that fiction has to avoid on grounds of implausibility but real life allows, Mr Miliband is Jewish.)  But he was not merely reprimanded, or sent for anger management, or removed from his post, or dropped from a BBC talk program over this.  The police came and arrested him.  He faces a criminal charge of inciting religious hatred, which can carry a seven-year prison term.  (For a newspaper account, see &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article5693687.ece"&gt;this report in &lt;i&gt;The Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a while for the US/UK constitutional and cultural difference to sink in, even for me.  I moved back from the USA to the UK 18 months ago, and intellectually I was well aware of the facts.  It still surprised me, after a couple of decades of watching unbelievably repellent public speech being protected by American, to see someone under arrest for mere speech, and on an emotional military/political issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is that Britain has absolutely no analog of the American guarantee of freedom of speech in its legal system.  There is no Bill of Rights saying that ordinary citizens can speak their opinions freely, even in political matters (the 1689 Act known as the English Bill of Rights guarantees only that Members of Parliament have that privilege when they are speaking in the parliamentary chamber).  The government can directly control what appears in the newspapers if it wants to, and has often done so.  The courts can also, quite separately, block news reports of various sorts and do so all the time ("who for legal reasons cannot be named", say the newspapers when mentioning someone who a judge doesn't want identified in news reports).  And speech about other racial, ethnic, or religious groups can have serious consequences here.  Iit's not all just &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1113"&gt;golliwogs and white wine&lt;/a&gt;.  You shout out your opinions of the "fucking Jews" here, and you can face years in prison.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Comments are off because I'm merely pointing you to a developing news story about use of language under two different political systems.  I am &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; chairing a discussion on anti-Semitism, or the merits or culpability of Mr Laxton's outburst, or his suitability for high-level diplomatic work, or the existence of threats to freedom of speech in the USA, or the membership policies of Regent's Park gyms, or the &lt;a href="http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/cardio_workout_prompts_antisem.php"&gt;dangers of getting too exercised at the gym&lt;/a&gt;.  As a courtesy to the senior Jewish academic who wrote to me to express his deep disappointment at my silence on the issue of British anti-Semitism, let me just say — and it really should be unnecessary — that I am personally appalled at Laxton&amp;#39;s outburst, and don&amp;#39;t believe for one moment that he should be working as a senior diplomat if that&amp;#39;s how he thinks (and even shouts at the TV set in a public place).  In my view he should be removed from his government job, and his heels shouldn&amp;#39;t even touch the ground on the way out.

So I know this is not a personal blog though, as I write a lot about my son Charlie and have been going on and on a bit about the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_once_and_former_warrior_mom"&gt;warrior mom thing&lt;/a&gt;, there's something of a personal hue over whatever I write here. Advocacy is inevitably a very personal act for me; it's often not about making signs or addressing crowds through megaphones on the steps of Important Government Buildings. It's often about just &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;going out and being with&lt;/a&gt; Charlie, whose disability is simultaneously invisible and yet, from the way people sometimes respond to him after a glance, all too obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally though one has to let the lines of private and more "pro"-style blogging converge and put a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; personal stamp on what gets written here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, behold. This is a math worksheet, fully completed---twenty subtraction problems. Charlie punches in the numbers using a $1 "big keys" calculator from Target and then reads out the answers after leaning forward over the little screen. I write the answers down, and it's onto the next problem. (Charlie's control of the pencil is yet imprecise.) Usually we just do three or maybe even five and Charlie's asking for a break. On Monday night, though, he did the first five and then the next and the next and the next and the next, until the whole sheet was finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie just really started to do worksheets with addition and subtraction and a calculator this school year. As I've been noting since starting to write this blog, the past few months &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;haven't been the easiest&lt;/a&gt;. When Charlie was younger, more than a few parents told me that their children (boys in particular) had been "okay, and then they hit 13"---became &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;adolescents&lt;/a&gt;---and something went tough. More than a few of those boys are now in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;residential placements&lt;/a&gt;. It's a simple fact that Charlie is simply a bigger boy with a tremendous amount of energy in him; this winter has not helped. Charlie's a bike-riding, ocean-faring kind of kid  and ice and snow render those activities, well, at least  bit chilly and just not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in the 50s this past weekend and you can be sure Jim dragged out the bikes and, needing only a sweatshirt (no parka), Charlie sailed forth after Jim for an almost 12 mile bike ride. Charlie does best with &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_couch_potatoes_here"&gt;daily aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; but he often seems most in his element when the exercise is of a more intense nature, somewhat like the skiing lessons for kids on the spectrum given by the co-founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.extremesportscamp.org/"&gt;Extreme Sports Camp&lt;/a&gt;, as described in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20090210/NEWS/902109971/1077&amp;amp;ParentProfile=1058&amp;amp;title=Aspen%20camp%20helps%20autistic%20children%20find%20outlet%20with%20skiing"&gt;Aspen Times&lt;/a&gt;. Yoga's great (Charlie's been doing it on and off in Adapted Physical Ed for the past few years) but a real &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_working_out_works_out"&gt;work out&lt;/a&gt; best engages him. Gotta sweat, gotta go places, gotta build up endurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say life's not a sprint but a &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/jonathan-brunot-marathon-runner/"&gt;marathon&lt;/a&gt;. Seems to me we're starting spring training here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234333995861"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/andrew-wakefield-worst-person-in-the-world/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2bec6afb59d0ef9f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="anti-vaccine lunacy"/><category term="Andrew Wakefield"/><category term="Keith Olbermann"/><category term="vaccines"/><title type="html">Andrew Wakefield: Worst Person in the World!</title><published>2009-02-11T06:27:58Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T06:27:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/andrew-wakefield-worst-person-in-the-world/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/andrew_wakefield_worst_person_in_the_wor.php"&gt;Keith Olbermann has declared Andrew Wakefield “The Worst Person in the World.”&lt;/a&gt; You can watch the video by clicking the link.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight-year study in 161,808 postmenopausal women echoes recent disappointing vitamin studies in men. Americans spend billions of dollars on vitamins to boost their health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author, researcher Marian Neuhouser of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, offered this advice: “Get nutrients from food. Whole foods are better than dietary supplements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what do they know, right? They’re only an expert. I’m skeptical that those obsessed with food supplements will continue to believe they provide health benefits far beyond what they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.smh.com.au/2009/02/10/377214/dannynalliah420-420x0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.smh.com.au/2009/02/10/377214/dannynalliah420-420x0.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well now&lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/pastors-abortion-dream-inflames-bushfire-tragedy-20090210-832f.html"&gt; CTF Ministries is blaming the Australian bushfires on new abortion laws&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Catch the Fire Ministries has tried to blame the bushfires disaster on laws decriminalising abortion in Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentecostal church’s leader, Pastor Danny Nalliah, claimed he had a dream about raging fires on October 21 last year and that he woke with “a flash from the Spirit of God: that His conditional protection has been removed from the nation of Australia, in particular Victoria, for approving the slaughter of innocent children in the womb”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, not quite the Martin Luther King kinda dream is it? As always religious charlatans prove there is no limits to how repulsive they can be. The Australian Skeptics cover this story on &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/"&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, sometimes he strikes me as the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/in_the_interests_of_bipartisan_annoyance.php"&gt;liberal version of Rush Limbaugh&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention a blowhard. However, occasionally, he still has it, and when he's on, no one skewers the dishonest better than he does. For instance, after a media flack and the usual inclusion of Bill O'Reilly as runners up, meet Andrew Wakefield, the Worst Person in the World for February 10, 2009:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit msnbc.com for &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/"&gt;Breaking News&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507"&gt;World News&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072"&gt;News about the Economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That about sums it up right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how long before the antivaccinationist loons descend on Olbermann's website and try to tell him that Paul Offit is the Worst Person in the World. Feel free to send him a congratulatory message at &lt;a href="mailto:countdown@msnbc.com"&gt;countdown@msnbc.com&lt;/a&gt;.

And I’m happy that we’re becoming more visible. But some of this athvertising I think is working against us, and that’s the material that’s been coming out of the Freedom from Religion Foundation lately. Don’t get me wrong. I really appreciate everything the organization has done for atheists but I feel like recently it’s suffering from poor decisions from the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religious rhetoric has shifted in recent years to embrace a more Orwellian Newspeak. Here are some examples of the pattern we’re beginning to see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is Religion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion is Science&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Religion is Cult&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christianity is just a relationship with God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationism is Intelligent Design, teaching the controversy, or teaching the weaknesses of Evolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution is the religion of Darwinism or the religion of atheism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin is the messiah of atheism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Origin of Species is The Bible of atheism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins is an evangelical atheist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the organization is Dan Barker, a former evangelical minister, who I’m starting to think someone was right in describing him as having converted from an evangelical Christian to an evangelical atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan Barker lately seems to be feeding into these negative labels. First it was with what I think was the indefensible holiday  “display” in Olympia, Washington 2 months ago. Here atheists had the opportunity to send a positive message like with the Tree of Knowledge display put up by the Freethought Society of Greater Philadelphia. Instead the opportunity was wasted on a sign (not a display) that basically just insulted believers. It showed no effort or thought at all. And when defending the indefensible sign on news shows, members of the Freedom from Religion Foundation just came off as dishonest or just out of touch with how the general public would view the displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/8226/darwinposteroz6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/8226/darwinposteroz6.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="117"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5934#more-5934"&gt;Now the Freedom from Religion Foundation is putting up a new billboard&lt;/a&gt; around the country in areas where famous evolution trials were fought with the slogan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Praise Darwin:  Evolve Beyond Belief”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slogan is meant to be read ironically. The problem is that the general public isn’t in on the joke and will likely just read this as comfirmation that atheists worship Charles Darwin like a messiah and that evolution really is the religion of atheism. It’s just going to feed into the anti-atheist and creationist propaganda, not counter it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I cannot endorse this sign. It does not speak for me and I am baffled that enough people at the FfRF thought this was a good idea long enough for it to get to this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=2&amp;amp;day=11&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;16 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.  As always, you should &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/357" title=""&gt;rate the articles&lt;/a&gt;, post &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/254" title=""&gt;notes and comments&lt;/a&gt; and send &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/cms/node/261" title=""&gt;trackbacks&lt;/a&gt; when you blog about the papers.  You can now also easily place articles on various social services (CiteULike, Connotea, Stumbleupon, Facebook and Digg) with just one click. Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004362" title=""&gt;Genetic Determinants of Financial Risk Taking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Individuals vary in their willingness to take financial risks. Here we show that variants of two genes that regulate dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission and have been previously linked to emotional behavior, anxiety and addiction (5-HTTLPR and DRD4) are significant determinants of risk taking in investment decisions. We find that the 5-HTTLPR s/s allele carriers take 28% less risk than those carrying the s/l or l/l alleles of the gene. DRD4 7-repeat allele carriers take 25% more risk than individuals without the 7-repeat allele. These findings contribute to the emerging literature on the genetic determinants of economic behavior.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004387" title=""&gt;Empathy Is Moderated by Genetic Background in Mice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Empathy, as originally defined, refers to an emotional experience that is shared among individuals. When discomfort or alarm is detected in another, a variety of behavioral responses can follow, including greater levels of nurturing, consolation or increased vigilance towards a threat. Moreover, changes in systemic physiology often accompany the recognition of distressed states in others. Employing a mouse model of cue-conditioned fear, we asked whether exposure to conspecific distress influences how a mouse subsequently responds to environmental cues that predict this distress. We found that mice are responsive to environmental cues that predict social distress, that their heart rate changes when distress vocalizations are emitted from conspecifics, and that genetic background substantially influences the magnitude of these responses. Specifically, during a series of pre-exposure sessions, repeated experiences of object mice that were exposed to a tone-shock (CS-UCS) contingency resulted in heart rate deceleration in subjects from the gregarious C57BL/6J (B6) strain, but not in subjects from the less social BALB/cJ (BALB) strain. Following the pre-exposure sessions, subjects were individually presented with the CS-only for 5 consecutive trials followed by 5 consecutive pairings of the CS with the UCS. Pre-exposure to object distress increased the freezing responses of B6 mice, but not BALB mice, on both the CS-only and the CS-UCS trials. These physiological and behavioral responses of B6 mice to social distress parallel features of human empathy. Our paradigm thus has construct and face validity with contemporary views of empathy, and provides unequivocal evidence for a genetic contribution to the expression of empathic behavior.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004439" title=""&gt;Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospital In-Patients: A Prospective Analysis of 3695 Patient-Episodes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major cause of hospital admissions, but recent data on the incidence and clinical characteristics of ADRs which occur following hospital admission, are lacking. Patients admitted to twelve wards over a six-month period in 2005 were assessed for ADRs throughout their admission. Suspected ADRs were recorded and analysed for causality, severity and avoidability and whether they increased the length of stay. Multivariable analysis was undertaken to identify the risk factors for ADRs. The 5% significance level was used when assessing factors for inclusion in multivariable models. Out of the 3695 patient episodes assessed for ADRs, 545 (14.7%, 95% CI 13.6-15.9%) experienced one or more ADRs. Half of ADRs were definitely or possibly avoidable. The patients experiencing ADRs were more likely to be older, female, taking a larger number of medicines, and had a longer length of stay than those without ADRs. However, the only significant predictor of ADRs, from the multivariable analysis of a representative sample of patients, was the number of medicines taken by the patient with each additional medication multiplying the hazard of an ADR episode by 1.14 (95% CI 1.09, 1.20). ADRs directly increased length of stay in 147 (26.8%) patients. The drugs most frequently associated with ADRs were diuretics, opioid analgesics, and anticoagulants. In conclusion, approximately one in seven hospital in-patients experience an ADR, which is a significant cause of morbidity, increasing the length of stay of patients by an average of 0.25 days/patient admission episode. The overall burden of ADRs on hospitals is high, and effective intervention strategies are urgently needed to reduce this burden.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_122.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/PiR4efD9VQk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234315954263"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4147">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/527acbe8ecfaa97c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Faith" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="darwin" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Darwin"/><category term="religion" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="religion"/><title type="html">Anglicans &amp;amp; Catholics singing the same tune...</title><published>2009-02-11T01:29:44Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T01:30:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/anglicans-catho.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;…and the tune is evolution.  A few things that I happened on today that give some updates on what these groups think about Darwin and evolution, now and in the past.  Even if you’re one of those people who think religion is evil and moderate religion is the worst of all, it’s worth being aware of what the dominant opinions are and how they are changing in various groups.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
First up is &lt;a href="http://www.fulcrum-anglican.org.uk/page.cfm?ID=342" rel="external "&gt;geologist/historian/Vicar Michael Roberts giving his (very informed) opinion on creationism and evolution in the Church of England, then and now&lt;/a&gt;.  He sees very little evidence of antievolutionism among English Anglicans for most of the last 150 years, but suggests that in the last 20 years, perhaps 5% of clergy have become YECs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have “&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5705331.ece" rel="external "&gt;Vatican buries the hatchet with Charles Darwin&lt;/a&gt;” from the U.K. &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.  Apparently the Vatican is making a substantial effort to stamp out the Discovery-Institute-originated pro-ID spin that has been promoted on various statements from the Pope:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leading official declared yesterday that Darwin’s theory of evolution was compatible with Christian faith, and could even be traced to St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas. “In fact, what we mean by evolution is the world as created by God,” said Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi, head of the Pontifical Council for Culture. The Vatican also dealt the final blow to speculation that Pope Benedict XVI might be prepared to endorse the theory of Intelligent Design, whose advocates credit a “higher power” for the complexities of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Larry Moran is doing a series of posts on Darwin, and posts a section of Westminster Abbey’s webpage on &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/westminster-abbey-darwin-vs-newton.html" rel="external "&gt;Darwin’s burial&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dean of Westminster, George Granville Bradley, was away in France when he received a telegram forwarded from the President of the Royal Society in London saying “…it would be acceptable to a very large number of our fellow-countrymen of all classes and opinions that our illustrious countryman, Mr Darwin, should be buried in Westminster Abbey”. The Dean recalled “ I did not hesitate as to my answer and telegraphed direct…that my assent would be cheerfully given”. The body lay overnight in the Abbey, in the small chapel of St Faith, and on the morning of 26 April the coffin was escorted by the family and eminent mourners into the Abbey. The pall-bearers included Sir Joseph Hooker, Alfred Russel Wallace, James Russell Lowell (U.S. Ambassador), and William Spottiswoode (President of the Royal Society).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burial service was held in the Lantern, conducted by Canon Prothero, with anthems sung by the choir. The chief mourners then followed the coffin into the north aisle of the Nave where Darwin was buried next to the eminent scientist Sir John Herschel, and a few feet away from Sir Isaac Newton. The simple inscription on his grave reads “CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN BORN 12 FEBRUARY 1809. DIED 19 APRIL 1882”. Although an agnostic, Darwin was greatly respected by his contemporaries and the Bishop of Carlisle, Harvey Goodwin, in a memorial sermon preached in the Abbey on the Sunday following the funeral, said “I think that the interment of the remains of Mr Darwin in Westminster Abbey is in accordance with the judgment of the wisest of his countrymen…It would have been unfortunate if anything had occurred to give weight and currency to the foolish notion which some have diligently propagated, but for which Mr Darwin was not responsible, that there is a necessary conflict between a knowledge of Nature and a belief in God…”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, if Larry posted this, he must agree with it! (Just kidding Larry) [ducks for cover]&lt;/p&gt;

Luskin attempted to argue, based on his detailed study of a museum exhibit and some quote-mining, that the entire world community of paleoanthropologists has no idea what they are talking about when it comes to Lucy.  Afarensis was calm and polite, which was fine and admirable, but the one danger of being completely polite when commenting on something like Luskin’s piece is that the degree of outrageousness, incompetence, and silliness in the creationists’ work is not fully exposed.  For example, it’s not just wrong to say, as Luskin does, that Lucy is the most complete hominid skeleton available, it’s wildly, flabbergastingly, bang-your-head-against-the-wall obvious that this is wrong, and anyone even vaguely familiar with the field knows it.  Anyone who didn’t know it could &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/15000.html" rel="external "&gt;look it up in 10 seconds on google and find for example the &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; specimen Turkana Boy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Here’s the quote from Luskin, he hasn’t issued a correction although the mistake has been pointed out for days now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing my friends and I noticed when seeing Lucy’s bones was the incompleteness of her skeleton. Only 40% was found, and a significant percentage of the known bones are rib fragments. Very little useful material from Lucy’s skull was recovered. (This seems to be common: many of the replica skulls of early hominids at the exhibit were clearly based upon extremely fragmentary pieces.) &lt;strong&gt;And yet, Lucy still represents the most complete known hominid skeleton to date.&lt;/strong&gt; (bold original)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="http://zinjanthropus.wordpress.com/2009/02/09/love-for-lucy/" rel="external "&gt;Zinjanthropus, without losing it, gives some more sense of the outrageousness of Luskin’s claims&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, he says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the next rainstorm could wash Lucy away completely, what happened during the prior rainstorms to mix-up “Lucy” with who-knows-what? How do we know that “Lucy” doesn’t represent bones from multiple individuals or even multiple species?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you see, a person doesn’t get to be a paleontologist unless she knows her anatomy.  She has to know where every single little muscle attaches onto every single little bone.  It’s her job.  All of this anatomical knowledge makes it really easy when someone comes into a forensic anthropologist and says, “I think I’ve found a human skeleton behind my house, and I suspect murder!”  A forensic anthropologist can go to that site, look at a single bone fragment from the tibia or a medial phalanx and tell the person, “No, don’t worry, this is just a dog.”  She can do this because she is intimately familiar with anatomy, and knows how, in the dog, the tibial plateau will be shaped quite differently than in the human because of the different mechanical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paleoanthropologists can do the same thing with Lucy’s pelvis or femur.  The pelvis and femur don’t look like anything we see in any quadrupedal animal at all.  And wow- that COMPLETE sacrum is just screaming “BIPEDAL ANIMAL HERE!!!”  We can look at muscle attachment sites and say, “Gee, whoever this was, she had a really huge gluteus minimus!”  We can then compare the size of different gluteus minimus muscles across the animal kingdom and see that only animals who walk upright have such a large gluteus minimus.  So, it’s not merely that we’ve counted up our bones and we don’t have any duplicates.  We can look at the &lt;em&gt;functional anatomy&lt;/em&gt; of these bones and determine that we don’t have a quadruped. [formatting original]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans of the great Cambrian predator, &lt;i&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/i&gt;, will be pleased to hear that a cousin lived at least until the Devonian, over 100 million years later. That makes this a fairly successful clade of great-appendage arthropods — a group characterized by a pair of very large and often spiky manipulatory/feeding arms located in front of the mouth. Here&amp;#39;s the new fellow, &lt;i&gt;Schinderhannes bartelsi&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Scale bar, 10 mm [for (A) to (G)]. (&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;) Mouth-part. Scale bar, 5 mm.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some significant differences between familiar old &lt;i&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Schinderhannes&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Anomalocaris&lt;/i&gt; was a monster that grew to about a meter long; this little guy is about a tenth of that, around 4 inches. He also has those interesting "wings" behind his head, which presumably aided in swimming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant feature of this animal is that it has characters that place it in the Euarthropoda, which makes great appendages paraphyletic and primitively present in euarthropods. Those great appendages have long been a curiousity, and we've wondered whether they are a unique innovation that was completely lost in modern arthropods, or whether they evolved into one of the other more familiar cephalic appendages; the authors suggest that this linkage with the euarthropod family tree implies that chelicera (what you may recognize as the big paired 'fangs' of spiders) are modified great appendages.&lt;/p&gt;

We have so much power for communication and dissemination of information here in the virtual, and yet, we are most often advocating for things that exist physically, that can be touched, smelled, that happen outside the computer.  Firing an abusive staff member, getting appropriate dental care, accessing affordable housing with sufficient support for a high quality of life--all of these are things that exist within the visceral.  Effective advocacy work here requires finding some way to bridge that divide, to harness the power of information and online community for physical-world impact.  How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computers and Internet make my life possible.  I rely on my computer to communicate, to preform tasks that fall into the chasms of my learning disabilities, and to replace a large number of executive function skills I never managed to develop.  My computer is what enables me to do self-advocacy work, both offline as my voice and online as my connection to the greater advocacy community.  Through text based, asynchronous interfaces, no one dismisses me based on the strangeness of my appearance, and no one knows how much I struggle with my pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have little to ability interface with self-advocates and self-advocacy organizations that don't work well within the 'net.  For organizations that are older, or people who lack literacy (computer or otherwise), or who were discouraged from using technology, or who simply don't feel comfortable, I'm left without a common interface.  I can email all day long, but interactive telephone calls are beyond my capacity to manage.  I look at these more viscerally-based self-advocacy groups and see that they have something which I do not--they have a strong network of resources for real-world action.  They can pick up the phone and tell someone what they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been struggling for a while now to invent an interface between the power of the my online community to instantly inform a world of advocates, and the (mostly inaccessible to me) direct effectiveness of a face-to-face speech in front of a senator.  I've found too that these off-line based self-advocacy groups have been struggling in the other direction: they need my communication networks, just as much as I need their off-line resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. What are the barriers to empowering off-line self-advocates with online technology, and how to overcome them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. What are the barriers to integrating online self-advocates with off-line communities, and how to over come &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. How does any activist community cross that rift between information and sensation; how does what we do here, online, translate into concrete impact here, in the physical space where we sit reading this post?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. When does it make more sense to build coalitions of online and off-line empowered organizations to share resources instead of teaching specific individuals new skills?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've no immediate answer to any of these questions, but I do have a very, very deep interest in getting them answered.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234310030517"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3035">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5cee48a918c0f391</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Food"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="funny"/><title type="html">Bus Sign Generator fun</title><published>2009-02-10T23:50:10Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T23:50:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/bus-sign-generator-fun/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m sure somewhere you’ve heard about the silliness about &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7875834.stm?lss"&gt;dueling bus slogans&lt;/a&gt; in Britain and elsewhere. &lt;img title="bus" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/bus.jpg?w=480&amp;amp;h=320" alt="bus" width="480" height="320"&gt;Now someone has created an &lt;a href="http://ruletheweb.co.uk/b3ta/bus/"&gt;online Bus Sign Generator&lt;/a&gt;.  You had ta’ know I’d go there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is "relieving symptoms" to be distinguished from "curing" a disability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest biggy of the biggest biggies is &lt;a href="http://citizenship.typepad.com/blogfordarwin/" title=""&gt;Blog For Darwin&lt;/a&gt; blog swarm - submit your entries &lt;a href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_5674.html" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are some other, smaller initiatives out there.  For instance, &lt;a href="http://happybdaychuck.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;this Darwin Meme&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="http://www.etrilobite.com/?p=644" title=""&gt;Darwinfest haiku contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you are blogging more seriously and sholarly about Darwin's place in history, or his publications, then certainly that would fit into the next &lt;a href="http://ontheshouldersofgiants.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Giant's Shoulders&lt;/a&gt; carnival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, follow and use the &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Darwin" title=""&gt;#Darwin hashtag&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt; Darwin's Legacy: Evolution's Impact on Science and Culture

&lt;p&gt;March 19-21, 2009&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNCW's Evolution Learning Community will be hosting "Darwin's Legacy: Evolution's Impact on Science and Culture," a multidisciplinary student conference on March 19-21, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference will be a unique opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students in the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities and arts who are conducting research or creative endeavors related to evolution to present their research, investigate graduate study opportunities, network, enhance their resumes, and enrich the body of knowledge surrounding evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of the four keynote speakers, all presentations will be made by students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keynote Speakers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Buss, University of Texas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Carruthers, University of Maryland&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Mindell, California Academy of Sciences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Padian, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We all knew that Andrew Wakefield's research was bogus and the link between vaccines and autism was engineered by ideologues who fear vaccines irrationally.  But &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;fabrication of data?&lt;/a&gt;  Sloppy research is one thing, but the need for cranks to be correct, no matter what reality reflects, has resulted in yet another example of egregious dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in line, however, with what we know about cranks.  Mark Crislip recently wrote an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=360"&gt;interesting piece on mathematics crankery&lt;/a&gt; which bears upon just this phenomenon.  Mathematics is a wonderful area to study crankery because as Crislip points out, mathematics is a field in which it is possible to distinguish between the possible and the impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In mathematics there are things that are impossible. Absolutely impossible. No ifs, ands, or buts. Impossible. Can't be done no how no way. In the world of mathematics, things are not only impossible, they are proven truly impossible within the boundaries of the mathematical discipline.

&lt;p&gt;An example of mathematical impossibility is the quadrature of the circle, also called squaring the circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible, using only a straight edge ruler and a compass, to construct a square with the same area as a given circle. It was proved to be impossible in 1882 by Lindeman. Not improbable or unlikely or very, very, very difficult. With in mathematical reality, it is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in his review of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMathematical-Cranks-Spectrum-Underwood-Dudley%2Fdp%2Fsitb-next%2F0883855070&amp;amp;tag=httpsciencc07-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Mathematical Cranks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpsciencc07-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt; he hits upon many of the commonalities between cranks we discussed in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/05/crank_howto.php"&gt;the Crank HOWTO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Crislip's description of the mathematical crank:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;1) They are convinced that their opinion is superior to the accumulated opinion of 2000 years of mathematics and mathematicians. That hundreds of mathematicians have worked for hundreds of years on these problems and found no errors in the proof that it is impossible to square a circle is of no consequence. Despite the accumulated mathematical knowledge of uncounted mathematicians, they are convinced that their solution is the right solution. Everyone else for all of history has been wrong. There is a tinge of megalomania in all the correspondence, and some appear to me to be clinically insane.

&lt;p&gt;2) To accommodate their solutions, they are willing to alter reality to fit their proofs. There are solutions to squaring the circle, but they require a value of pi that is different that 3.14159265... Pi, for those that have forgotten, is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle and is a constant of the universe. For some circle squarers, Pi has a different value and all the mathematics that has confirmed the current value of pi is wrong. Others deny that pi exists or that the definition is meaningless, since they can construct a squared circle with pencil and paper, and send in the (flawed) construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) When errors of math or logic are pointed out, they respond not with understanding, but a redoubling of efforts to prove that their erroneous solution to the problem is actually correct. They are incapable of recognizing flaws in logic, or mathematics, or flaws that are in opposition to mathematical consistency. A crank cannot recognize their error because they cannot recognize that their reality differs from mathematical reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Cranks are impervious to arguments based on mathematical reality. They do not recognize or understand that their solutions are in error because the solution contradicts known mathematical reality. They do not base their solutions on known mathematics, but on their own flawed understanding of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Cranks evidently send their 'solutions' to multiple mathematical departments and rarely receive a reply. This silence from academia is interpreted not that their solution is worthless, but that there is a conspiracy of Professors of Mathematics to keep their solution secret, to the detriment of human kind. Big Math, out to suppress the truth THEY don't not want you to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is obvious to me that no matter what the field, the problem is crankery - the defective thought processes that allow people to believe in nonsense, no matter what obstacles reality throws in their path.  Every description of every crank in every field ultimately boils down to these same factors.  Cranks believe in something contrary to observable reality.  They will do anything to prove it.  When reality gets in their way, they ignore, subvert, lie, cheat, or obfuscate to create confusion.  And when it's proven beyond all doubt they're wrong?  That's when the conspiracies come out.  &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/08/doctor-andrew-wakefield-w_n_165033.html"&gt;The comments on the Huffington Post coverage&lt;/a&gt; of the most recent Wakefield dishonesty are an excellent example of this.  Wakefield is a victim of Big Pharma, being persecuted by Brian Deer, it's all a conspiracy against children by doctors and pharmaceutical companies etc.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more time passes the more I'm convinced that our original thesis on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/04/unified_theory_of_the_crank.php"&gt;cranks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/about.php"&gt;denialism in general&lt;/a&gt; has been confirmed again and again.  No matter what the foolish belief the problem the reality-based community is fighting is a defective pattern of thought, an incompetence in evaluating the quality of evidence that afflicts millions of individuals and ultimately is why so many people believe in such stupid things.  Wakefield, ultimately, is just another in a long line of cranks.  And while biology is never as concrete as mathematics, it is clear that accepting reality was never a part of the the anti-vaccine movement's ideology.  And what do cranks do when reality opposes your world view?  They do what Wakefield did.  Reject reality, and substitute their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after all this time I was surprised they would find outright fabrication in Wakefield's work, but I shouldn't have been.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You remember &lt;a href="http://www.lbc.co.uk/jeni-barnett-3530"&gt;Jeni Barnett&lt;/a&gt;, don't you? She's the U.K. radio host whose ill-informed rants against vaccines Ben Goldacre &lt;a href="http://www.lbc.co.uk/jeni-barnett-3530"&gt;exposed so gloriously&lt;/a&gt; last week. Unfortunately, the price Ben paid consisted of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/help_ben_goldacre.php"&gt;threats of legal action for "copyright infringement"&lt;/a&gt; in the form of his having posted audio of the relevant segment of Barnett's show. Yes, LBC, the radio station on which Barnett's show runs, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-albc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;threatened to sue&lt;/a&gt;, forcing Ben to take down the audio. However, as almost always happens when a blogger is threatened in such a manner, the specter of legal action led to the audio files &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/jeni_barnett_mmr_show_-_full_t.php"&gt;metastasizing to many blogs&lt;/a&gt; and websites and screwed up Barnett's Google juice to the point where the first page of search results on her name is made up mostly of posts about what an antivaccination moron she is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the first failure of the memory hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second failure came after Jeni apparently didn't like all the negative comments that &lt;a href="http://www.jenibarnett.com/2009/02/mmr_and_me.php"&gt;her defense of what she said on the air&lt;/a&gt; brought to her blog. Most of the comments were unrelentingly negative, taking Barnett to task for her ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, ever-vigilant, &lt;em&gt;Le Canard Noir&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/jeni-barnett-have-you-lost-something.html"&gt;preserved Barnett's original post and all of its comments as of February 8&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, as it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/hivaids_denialism_the_ministry_of_truth.php"&gt;did for HIV/AIDS denialists&lt;/a&gt; the memory hole fails in the age of the Internet, and efforts to suppress criticism have massively backfired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When will the cranks ever learn?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/another_failure_of_the_memory_hole_thank.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/JJj2lccteDU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234300805583"><id gr:original-id="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/?p=188">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee688829563e6858</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Ofquack?s Guide For Homeopaths</title><published>2009-02-10T20:02:18Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T20:02:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/ofquacks-guide-for-homeopaths/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]I’ve been reading Ofquack’s criteria for professional registration of CAM practitioners here.

Odsłuchałem dużą część tej tyrady i stężenie dezinformacji tam zawartej faktycznie osiągnęło krytyczny poziom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goldacre ma wielu stałych czytelników i część z nich zaczęła zgłaszać swoje zastrzeżenia, co do treści audycji do &lt;a href="http://www.lbc.co.uk/jeni-barnett-3530"&gt;stacji radiowej LBC&lt;/a&gt; i na blogu Jeni Barnett. I tutaj zaczyna się prawdziwa jazda. Z Goldacrem kontaktują się prawnicy LBC i żądają zdjęcia pliku mp3 z zapisem programu, bo ich zdaniem naruszył prawa autorskie autorów i stacji. Ben w obawie przed pozwem usuwa plik ze swojej strony i &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;opisuje&lt;/a&gt; swoje przygody z prawnikami LBC na blogu i prosi o ewentualną pomoc prawną. W przeciągu kilku następnych dni dochodzi do pospolitego ruszenia naukowej i sceptycznej blogosfery:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;setki blogów opisują całe zdarzenie i na bieżąco relacjonują rozwój sytuacji (patrz agregator &lt;a href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/"&gt;http://www.badscienceblogs.net/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/lbc-mmr-jeni-barnett-an-early-day-motion-the-times-and-er-a-bit-of-stephen-fry/"&gt;wiele blogów i witryn internetiowych&lt;/a&gt;, które są poza zasięgiem jurysdykcji brytyjskiego systemu sprawiedliwości, ponownie zamieszcza całość lub fragmenty programu Jeni Barnett (także na &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Bad_Science:_Jeni_Barnett_MMR_and_vaccination_slot_on_LBC_radio%2C_2009"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt; i &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dRnkmw-_L4&amp;amp;feature=channel_page"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pojawiają się liczne zapisy, słowo w słowo, programu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blog Jeni Barnett, gdzie w dwóch postach probuje bronić swojego programu o szczepieniach, zostaje zapełniony przez krytyczne komentarze&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;o sprawie zaczynają pojawiać się &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article5696902.ece?Submitted=true"&gt;artykuł&lt;/a&gt; w prasie i jest on omawiany przez inne media&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sprawa może zahaczyć o brytyjski parlament&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Na tą chwilę już wiadomo, że Jeni Barnett najpierw &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/jeni-barnett-have-you-lost-something.html"&gt;usunęła wszystkie&lt;/a&gt; komentarze ze swojego bloga, pod postami, w których broniła swojego programu, a następnie usunęła w &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/10/jeni-barnett-and-the-missing-blog-posts-about-mmr-segment-on-lbc-radio/"&gt;całości swoje posty&lt;/a&gt; na ten temat.

Przypadek Jeni Barnett może będzie początkiem ofensywy przeciwko przeciwnikom szczepień, którzy zbyt długo byli potulnie traktowani przez media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sama reakcja blogosfery musi budzić podziw i uznanie.

&lt;p&gt;It’s the times when the news is supposed to be good that I’m not so good.   More specifically, when the news-giver thinks the news is good (”We’re pregnant!”)  and I think it’s not-so-good (”And you’ve already got 3 kids!  And you just got laid off!”)  That where my tiny black heart really shines, and I lose friends because I just can’t lie convincingly enough.  I think the lack of this social grace is disturbing, but I can’t seem to cultivate it, no matter how hard I try.&lt;/p&gt;

That was eight years after Friedrich Nietzsche, in &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/diefrohl7e.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gay Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asked us to imagine exactly such a scenario, in his notion of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return"&gt;eternal return&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if, some day or night, a demon were to steal after you in your loneliest loneliness and say to you: “This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again—and you with it, speck of dust!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of thing you come across when you’re writing a book about time.  Nietzsche wanted to suggest that a well-lived life was one you wouldn’t mind knowing would recur throughout eternity, while the prospect would cause gnashing of teeth for most of us.  Poincaré’s concerns were somewhat different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking up this passage, I stumbled across one of my favorite Nietzsche quotes, just a few aphorisms prior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, my friends, regarding all the moral chatter of some about others it is time to feel nauseous! Sitting in moral judgment should offend our taste! Let us leave such chatter and such bad taste to those who have nothing else to do but drag the past a few steps further through time and who never live in the present,—which is to say the many, the great majority! We, however, &lt;em&gt;want to become who we are&lt;/em&gt;,—the new, unique, incomparable ones, who give themselves their own laws, who create themselves! And to that end we must become the best learners and discoverers of everything that is lawful and necessary in the world: we must become &lt;em&gt;physicists&lt;/em&gt; in order to be able to be &lt;em&gt;creators&lt;/em&gt; in this sense,—while hitherto all valuations and ideals have been based on &lt;em&gt;ignorance&lt;/em&gt; of physics or were constructed so as to contradict it. Therefore: long live physics! And even more so that which &lt;em&gt;compels&lt;/em&gt; us to turn to physics,—our honesty!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quote which engenders, as you might imagine, swift elaborations on the part of &lt;a href="http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/Humanities/Beckman/Nietzsche/reading/Gay.html"&gt;Nietzsche scholars&lt;/a&gt; that he certainly wasn’t talking about what we ordinarily mean by “physics.”  But I’m not so sure.  The substance of physics (experimental results, theoretical understandings) is of no help whatsoever in leading a moral life.  But the method of physics — open-minded hypothesis testing and scrupulous honesty in confronting what Nature has to tell us — is a pretty good model for other aspects of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that physicists are, as a matter of empirical fact, any better at being good human beings on average than anyone else.  Even we physicists could learn to be better physicists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Conyers bill (a.k.a. Fair Copyright in Research Works Act, HR 801), is back. Despite all the debunking it got last time around, and despite the country having more important problems to deal with right now, this regressive bill, completely unchanged word-for-word, is apparently back again. It is the attempt by TA publishers, through lies and distortions, to overturn the NIH open access policy.  Here are some reactions - perhaps Rep.Conyers and colleagues should get an earful from us....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Suber, in &lt;a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/02/comments-on-conyers-bill.html" title=""&gt;Comments on the Conyers bill&lt;/a&gt; provides all the useful links, plus some of the blogospheric responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg Laden: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/02/open_access_under_threat.php" title=""&gt;Open Access Under Threat&lt;/a&gt; (also interesting discussion in the comments):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The publishing industry is dangerous. Why? Because it is big and rich, but it is also in danger. The publishing industry, like the music industry, and like the commercial proprietary software industry, faces structural reorganization of the markets served and uncertainty in the flow of cash into coffers. So we should not be surprised when we see the industry buying off members of congress to get legislation passed that protects the industry from change that is coming. Change the industry does not want to see.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scientist: &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/blog.jsp?type=blog&amp;amp;o_url=blog/display/55403&amp;amp;id=55403" title=""&gt;Anti-open access bill is back&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A bill aimed at undoing the NIH's mandate to make federally-funded research manuscripts freely available on PubMed Central within a year of publication was re-introduced in the US House of Representatives on Tuesday night (Feb. 3).

&lt;p&gt;The legislation claims that the NIH policy breaches existing copyright laws that protect academic publishers. If passed, the bill would stop federal agencies from requiring the transfer of copyright as a stipulation of investigators receiving taxpayer-backed grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Campus Entrepreneurship: &lt;a href="http://campusentrepreneurship.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/monopoly-rights-to-taxpayer-funded-research/" title=""&gt;Monopoly Rights to Taxpayer Funded Research?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This sounds like monopoly rights for publicly funded knowledge. Please contact representative John Conyers (MI) and ask him to stop pushing this bill. His co-sponsors on the bill appear to be Steve Cohen of TN, Trent Franks of AZ, Darrell Issa (CA), and Robert Wexler of FL. (BTW, should anyone representing Michigan be spending their time on this? Dereliction of duty?)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Bruggeman: &lt;a href="http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/prometheus/bill-introduced-to-roll-back-nih-open-access-4938" title=""&gt;Bill Introduced to Roll Back NIH Open Access&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a legislative effort to push back the move toward open access in scientific publishing.  Representative John Conyers, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has introduced a bill to roll back the National Institutes of Health requirement that its grantees provide a copy of their peer-reviewed articles to be published in PubMed Central, a free online database.  The competing interests in this issue (and similar efforts to make federally funded research more available to the public) are the copyright interests of the journals (which are typically assigned them by the authors) and an interest in making research - especially that funded by citizens' tax dollars - more accessible to the public.

&lt;p&gt;I lean toward the latter, but I suspect that journals will be forced to revamp their publication models and business plans long after newspapers do, even though there are some similarities in how online access to information has undercut their respective market advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Eisen: &lt;a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=162" title=""&gt;Conyers reintroduces bill to kill NIH Public Access Policy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As many have pointed out, the whole premise of the bill is absurd. Publishers are arguing that the NIH has taken their copyright. But, of course, if that were true, they would already have protection under federal copyright law, and they would be suing the government. Instead, they are pushing legislation that would actually remove the governments right to distribute work it funds, thereby clearly demonstrating that they believe the government's action is perfectly legal under copyright law.

&lt;p&gt;What is particularly galling is that Conyers held hearings on this bill last year, in which a LOT of important issues were raised about the bill, and there were many on the committee who were skeptical about it. So, what does Conyers do with all that useful feedback? He ignores it, and introduces exactly the same bill in the new Congress. One hopes such an ill-conceived piece of public policy would have no hope when Congress has many more important things on its hands, but one never knows. Let's hope it dies in committee. But just to be safe, let the members know how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's hard to know why Conyers is doing this. He receives some modest contributions from Elsevier and some others in the publishing industry - but it's hard to imagine $4,000 buys a piece of legislation.  Conyers has recently reorganized the House Judiciary Committee in order to take control of intellectual property cases, so maybe this is part of a more broadly orchestrated "defense" of copyright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related - Questionable Authority: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2009/02/way_to_support_science_reed_el.php" title=""&gt;Way To Support Science, Reed Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reed Elsevier is one of the leading - if not the leading - publishers of scientific journals. They make profits on the scale of thousands of dollars a minute selling these journals to libraries so that scientists can read them. They have, I'd suggest, some motivation to keep from pissing scientists off any more than necessary.

&lt;p&gt;Which is why I was almost surprised to discover that Reed Elsevier Inc. gave Senator Inhofe $16,500 in 2008, with $3,000 of that coming right from their own Political Action Committee. It's nice to know that Reed Elsevier is always ready to stand behind scientists. With a knife in their hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/ah_that_conyers_bill_again.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/n-oOTT26-vo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234289882833"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1123">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/89c1104fd4ed5ce8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">Still ahead of his time</title><published>2009-02-10T18:16:10Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T18:16:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1123" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning's NY Times science section is devoted to memorializing  Charles Darwin, and the title of one of the featured articles is: "He was  prescient in 1859, and is still ahead of his time." My first reaction to  this headline was an unreflecting interpretation of it as simply meaning,  'Darwin was ahead of his time and his ideas are still on the cutting  edge.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my second reaction was quite conscious: Wait a minute; this is  an error — perhaps akin to those &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=813"&gt;frequently noted confusions&lt;/a&gt; like  "falling between the cracks" or "No brain damage is too minor to be  ignored."  (If indeed they are properly considered confusions, see  below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been okay to have said &amp;quot;still ahead of the times,&amp;quot;  where &amp;quot;the times&amp;quot; refers, as intended, to the present time, and &amp;quot;still&amp;quot;  serves to relate the present time to Darwin&amp;#39;s time.  But read closely,  either &amp;quot;still ahead of his time&amp;quot; is true simply because he was ahead of  his time when alive, and so the predication would be satisfied in any  situation in which the subject was ahead of his time when alive and so is  utterly uninformative — or it would mean nothing at all.  But my third  thought was provoked by the voice of the tiny angel of common sense that  sits on the shoulder of every academic (or should), who whispered, &amp;quot;Whoa,  even if this is an error in some persnickety sense, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be  cavalierly dismissed as such because the expression works in communicating  its author&amp;#39;s intention and so how it manages to do this while breaking the  normal rules should be a matter of interest.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've thought of two ways to begin to tame this small but toothy linguistic  beast.  They are no more than beginnings. Doubtless other readers can  think of more, or can improve my fumblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First analysis: &amp;quot;Still&amp;quot; in a context like this means something like &amp;#39;up  until now&amp;#39;.  We&amp;#39;ve called the headline an error because saying that  Darwin&amp;#39;s having been ahead of his time is still TRUE is uninformative,  since there&amp;#39;s no earthly reason to suppose it isn&amp;#39;t still true. (&amp;quot;Yes,  George Washington is still dead.&amp;quot; [Please don&amp;#39;t ask me again.])  But if we  make the relatively small jump from TRUE to RELEVANT (and allow by common  metonymy, or even the conventional meaning of the idiom &amp;quot;ahead of his/her  time&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;his&amp;quot; to be read as &amp;#39;his ideas&amp;#39;), we get that Darwin was ahead of  his time in 1859 and his ideas are still relevant now. So that&amp;#39;s one way  to tame the beast. Maybe we have no thoretical warrant to change TRUE to  RELEVANT whenever it just happens to suit our purposes, but — what can I  say? — that&amp;#39;s life, or maybe journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second analysis: This one seems to require a twist, maybe a wrenching, of  what literary critics call "free indirect style" ("style indirect libre",  in the original French), in which indirect reference to speech or thought  (vs. direct quotation) can ignore the normal shifting of time, as in,  "What was she going to do now?" (We note that the word "now" can't  normally refer to a time in the past.) On this analysis we grant ourselves  license to speak of Darwin and his work as existing in the present time,  even though we're not indirectly quoting anybody, and can then assert the  work to be on the cutting edge of this time, while employing the word  "still" to relate it to its original time.  Those more familiar than I am  with the mixing or blending of Gilles Fauconnier's mental spaces can  probably straighten me out on this, perhaps even dispensing entirely  with the reference to free indirect style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not proud of either of these 'analyses' and hope LL readers can do  better, since the small problem posed by the headline seems to me an  interesting one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Paul Kay</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234289851403"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_safety_and_danger_of_police_registries">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c63cc142ac38e03</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Safety and Danger of Police Registries</title><published>2009-02-10T18:14:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T18:14:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_safety_and_danger_of_police_registries" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/166/434033536_89cbb56218_m.jpg" alt="a male police officer is showing a man a piece of paper, it is ambiguous what is happening between them. they are on a street corner in new york city" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;Registries, of any sort, are controversial--there is potential both for the benefits to be enormous, and for the price to be unbearable.  For police registries, the question of whether safety is being ensured or new and worse dangers are being threatened is not entirely clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about police registries a lot the past week.  There there was some good discussion here regarding &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_police_safety_not_just_for_kids"&gt;autism police safety&lt;/a&gt;.  Registries are mentioned in that thread, and in the tone of them being largely a positive thing.  Which of course they can be, and are likely intended to be.  Late last week I also got &lt;a href="http://www.brieflynews.org/briefly/?p=296"&gt;a report from the Oregon Health Forum&lt;/a&gt; regarding "a &lt;a href="http://www.leg.state.or.us/09reg/measures/hb2000.dir/hb2054.intro.html"&gt;proposed bill&lt;/a&gt; that would require the Oregon Department of State Police to create a mental health database."  While the database would be required, inclusion in the database would be voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so much with the tone of a positive thing there, the Oregon Health Forum report is an account of mostly opposing views on the bill, particularly by human and disability rights groups.  These views include concerns about greatly increased risk of discrimination, issues surrounding consent and coercion, lack of inclusion of people with medical or developmental disabilities, loss of privacy, potential for abusing the system by people who do not experience disability, and absence of clear education for police officers (what good is a registry if the information has no real meaning to the people who are to use it?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these issues were raised in the context of police safety registries, they are also applicable to registries for people with disabilities in general, for example the "mandatory autism registries" that are starting to crop up.  This is an enormously complex and controversial issue--on one hand these registries might help with some things like police safety or access to services, but on the other hand they may also serve as platforms for discrimination or exploitation.  And tangentially, fear of registries, legitimate or not, is a reason why some people are afraid to either get a diagnosis or to disclose their diagnosis of autism or other disability.  This can lead to people not getting assistance they may need desperately for survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about police registries a lot this past week too because an application for the &lt;a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/Police/index.cfm?c=43728"&gt;Portland Police Bureau Disability Accommodation Registry&lt;/a&gt; has sat on my desk, blank, waiting for me to fill it out, for at least half a year.  Sometimes I think I haven't filled it out yet because my executive function difficulties remain insurmountable without a support person to prod me into action.  Other times I think I haven't filled it out yet because I myself remain undecided about whether I want my name in that database after all...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police registries for people on the spectrum?  Yay or nay?  Pro or con?  What should we do?  Is there any way to ensure real safety here?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234289306977"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-9184506780075755133">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dbca71a30d2f12b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #107: Winners</title><published>2009-02-10T17:48:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T18:06:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/mondays-molecule-107-winners.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The red arrow points to a lysosome and the blue arrows identify peroxisomes.

[Eller is a cultural anthropologist who wrote the college textbook, &lt;em&gt;Introducing Anthropology of Religion&lt;/em&gt; (Routledge, 2007)]. The book is 468 pages long, well documented, and looks very well argued. I rarely recommend a book before actually reading through it, but this one looks like it's good enough to be an exception. I'll try to write more about it later, but read for yourselves the astounding reviews on amazon to see what others are saying about it. Anyone else read it yet?&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the tradition of Frederick Nietzsche, Eller begins in the introduction with a few aphorisms which sum up some of the arguments throughout his book. Here’s a small representative sample of eight pages of them:&lt;blockquote&gt;An atheist is not a person who knows too little about religion. An atheist is a person who knows too much about religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You say your god is unknowable? But the unknowable and the non-existent are indistinguishable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If atheism is a religion then not collecting stamps is a hobby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best argument against religion is all the other religions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the absence of evidence, the scientist says, “I don’t know,” but the religionist says, “I believe.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One does not have to prove a negative. One must assume a negative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old gods don’t get disproved. They get forgotten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It reads more like a contrarian backlash to all the attention being given to Darwin in this bicentennial of his birth. The author makes three general claims that he thinks justify his call to "kill Darwin".&lt;/p&gt;
        

&lt;p&gt;The first is a reasonable concern, that &amp;quot;equating evolution with Darwin&amp;quot; is misleading and can lead to public misunderstanding…but then Safina charges off into ridiculous hyperbole, that scientists are making Darwin into a &amp;quot;sacred fetish&amp;quot;, and creating a &amp;quot;cult of Darwinism&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s simply not true. I go through this every year, when I&amp;#39;m off to give a talks about Darwin around the time of Darwin Day, and there&amp;#39;s no deification going on anywhere. I talk about the central principles of Darwinism, which are still valid, but I also point out that he got many things wrong (genetics is the most vivid example), and that the science has advanced significantly since his day. I&amp;#39;ve talked to many other scientists who do the same sorts of lectures, and &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; portrays him as Saint Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for equating evolution and Darwin, I deny that, too. I reject the label of &amp;quot;Darwinist&amp;quot; because my interests in the field are so remote and alien from what Darwin did that we really don&amp;#39;t have much in common — I care about evo-devo and molecular phylogenies and gene regulation and signal transduction, none of which invalidate Darwin&amp;#39;s ideas about selection and change and common descent, but which are such distant derivations of 19th century science that if Darwin were handed one of the papers in the field, he would find it incomprehensible. Again, this is a common experience among my colleagues: we respect Darwin as the discoverer of a set of general core principles, principles that have stood the test of time and are still incredibly useful, but we&amp;#39;ve moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safina makes a second and very common error: he claims that Darwin didn't say anything new, anyway. There is a strange historical industry dedicated to finding omens and portents in other people's writings that preceded Darwin, and it is entirely true that ideas like the transmutation of species were bubbling up all over the place in pre-Darwinian Europe. You can also find short passages in the works of virtually unknown authors that even hint at the process of selection. Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus, was known as a bit of a heretic who contemplated the unity of all life, and Robert Chambers published his theory of evolution, &lt;i&gt;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&lt;/i&gt;, in 1844, and of course Wallace was the co-discoverer of the idea of natural selection. If there had been no Darwin, his theory would still have emerged out of the ferment of biological thought going on in that century. But he still deserves full credit. Darwin is the man who realized the grand import of the idea; this was no casual mention of an interesting possibility, but a profound recognition that his explanation for the origin of species was going to have a sweeping effect on science and society, and a determination that he would document it thoroughly and well. Darwin also explained the concept lucidly, and with volumes of evidence, to such a degree that Thomas Huxley would say "How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!" upon learning about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect for Darwin is as much for the disciplined and scientific way he addressed the problem as it is for the discovery itself. When we celebrate Darwin, we are not cheering for a man who got lucky one day, but for someone who represents many of what we consider scientific virtues: curiousity, rigor, discipline, meticulous observation, experiment, and intellectual courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safina&amp;#39;s third complaint is that we&amp;#39;ve discovered so much more since Darwin, that &amp;quot;Almost everything we understand about evolution came after Darwin, not from him&amp;quot;. This is trivially obvious. We could say similar things about Galileo, Newton, Boyle, Dalton, Lavoisier, Dalton, Mendel, any scientist of the past you can name. Mendel, for example, is a fellow I spend a week discussin in my genetics course to explain the simplistic basics…and then I spend the rest of the semester explaining that all of his postulates are so loaded with exceptions that they are often completely false in many real-world genetic situations. Yet at the same time his principles represent a powerful starting point for deciphering the complexities of genetics. Shall we throw Mendel out of the history books because 143 years of progress have reduced his seminal work to a relatively tiny blip in the volumes of evidence since?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safina is taking a deeply anti-historical position, and I would go so far as to call it an anti-scientific one, as well. Science is all about the evidence for what we know, and explaining how we know it; announcing that Darwin must go is to throw out the foundation of our discipline, and teach disrespect rather than appreciation for our origins. It's also damaging to public education: we can explain Darwin's insights to the lay public, but it's almost impossible to explain the details of modern research without relating it to the central questions that Darwin formulated 150 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, obviously, don&amp;#39;t canonize, beatify, or apotheosize Darwin … but don&amp;#39;t throw him out, either.

It reads more like a contrarian backlash to all the attention being given to Darwin in this bicentennial of his birth. The author makes three general claims that he thinks justify his call to "kill Darwin".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a reasonable concern, that &amp;quot;equating evolution with Darwin&amp;quot; is misleading and can lead to public misunderstanding…but then Safina charges off into ridiculous hyperbole, that scientists are making Darwin into a &amp;quot;sacred fetish&amp;quot;, and creating a &amp;quot;cult of Darwinism&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s simply not true. I go through this every year, when I&amp;#39;m off to give a talks about Darwin around the time of Darwin Day, and there&amp;#39;s no deification going on anywhere. I talk about the central principles of Darwinism, which are still valid, but I also point out that he got many things wrong (genetics is the most vivid example), and that the science has advanced significantly since his day. I&amp;#39;ve talked to many other scientists who do the same sorts of lectures, and &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; portrays him as Saint Darwin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for equating evolution and Darwin, I deny that, too. I reject the label of &amp;quot;Darwinist&amp;quot; because my interests in the field are so remote and alien from what Darwin did that we really don&amp;#39;t have much in common — I care about evo-devo and molecular phylogenies and gene regulation and signal transduction, none of which invalidate Darwin&amp;#39;s ideas about selection and change and common descent, but which are such distant derivations of 19th century science that if Darwin were handed one of the papers in the field, he would find it incomprehensible. Again, this is a common experience among my colleagues: we respect Darwin as the discoverer of a set of general core principles, principles that have stood the test of time and are still incredibly useful, but we&amp;#39;ve moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safina makes a second and very common error: he claims that Darwin didn't say anything new, anyway. There is a strange historical industry dedicated to finding omens and portents in other people's writings that preceded Darwin, and it is entirely true that ideas like the transmutation of species were bubbling up all over the place in pre-Darwinian Europe. You can also find short passages in the works of virtually unknown authors that even hint at the process of selection. Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus, was known as a bit of a heretic who contemplated the unity of all life, and Robert Chambers published his theory of evolution, &lt;i&gt;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&lt;/i&gt;, in 1844, and of course Wallace was the co-discoverer of the idea of natural selection. If there had been no Darwin, his theory would still have emerged out of the ferment of biological thought going on in that century. But he still deserves full credit. Darwin is the man who realized the grand import of the idea; this was no casual mention of an interesting possibility, but a profound recognition that his explanation for the origin of species was going to have a sweeping effect on science and society, and a determination that he would document it thoroughly and well. Darwin also explained the concept lucidly, and with volumes of evidence, to such a degree that Thomas Huxley would say "How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!" upon learning about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect for Darwin is as much for the disciplined and scientific way he addressed the problem as it is for the discovery itself. When we celebrate Darwin, we are not cheering for a man who got lucky one day, but for someone who represents many of what we consider scientific virtues: curiousity, rigor, discipline, meticulous observation, experiment, and intellectual courage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safina&amp;#39;s third complaint is that we&amp;#39;ve discovered so much more since Darwin, that &amp;quot;Almost everything we understand about evolution came after Darwin, not from him&amp;quot;. This is trivially obvious. We could say similar things about Galileo, Newton, Boyle, Dalton, Lavoisier, Dalton, Mendel, any scientist of the past you can name.

The bus campaign in the UK is wonderful, and &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3679"&gt;even though Tracy disagrees&lt;/a&gt;, I think the slogan is perfect: “There is probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.” It’s a casual and positive statement, and the campaign itself drew attention to the nation’s many atheists and freethinkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4465"&gt;Donna wrote about the Colorado Coalition for Reason’s billboards&lt;/a&gt;, which featured serene clouds and the slogan, “Don’t believe in God? You are not alone.” That, too, is positive and non-confrontational, making it all the more telling that local Christian groups still made a concerted effort to have them removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Freedom From Religion Foundation – which fights hard to protect the &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/purposes/"&gt;separation of church and state in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; – has also jumped in. Yesterday, press releases announced billboard ads going up around the country, including one in Whitehall, Ohio. The mayor of that town said some ignorant things about freethinkers in response to a request for the town to honor Darwin’s birthday on February 12. From the &lt;a href="http://www.ffrf.org/news/2009/darwin_whitehall.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were so shocked and offended at the statement by Whitehall Mayor John Wolfe to CBNS-TV Channel 10 saying, “We are a Christian nation,” and dismissing a constitutional violation because: ‘They’re atheists, they’re antagonists and they’re a minority,’ ” said Foundation co-president Annie Laurie Gaylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FfRF opted for this billboard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="Praise Darwin?" src="http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/8226/darwinposteroz6.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="145"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous FfRF billboards had the phrase “Imagine no religion,” but this new slogan was created to focus on Darwin in the 150-year anniversary of the publishing of On the Origins of Species. The new slogan has also appeared on billboards in Dover, PA, Dayton, OH, and Madison, WI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking as a copywriter, that billboard appears to be the result of cleverness gone wild. The slogan “Praise Darwin” is in fact clever – the idea behind celebrating Darwin Day is to praise a very intelligent man and his groundbreaking idea, so the phrase can mean that while satirizing the theistic outburst of “Praise Jesus,” in which usage “praise” has a different connotation of blind worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I suspect that’s not what’s going to be conveyed. Instead of people seeing satire and taking the “praise” to mean “celebrate the accomplishments of,” they’re going to see Darwinists worshiping their Atheist religion’s God. They constantly accuse evolutionary scientists of elevating Darwin to a god-like status, blindly believing in his theories without question and finding data to support the conclusion. Nothing could be further from the truth, but good luck convincing them of that when they bring up this billboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the FfRF does a wonderful job of protecting our rights and encouraging discourse, even inspiring freethinkers to take action and contact their politicians when it really matters. In this case, though, I think they screwed up.&lt;/p&gt;

Her abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;One aspect of the relationship between meaning and interaction is explored here by taking the English particle &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt;, which is characterized by flexibility of syntactic position, and investigating its use in a range of interactional contexts. Syntactic alternatives in the form of clause-initial or clause-final placement are found to be selected by reference to interactional exigencies. The temporally situated, contingent accomplishment of utterances in turns and their component turn-constructional units shows the emergence of meaning across a conversational sequence; it reveals syntactic flexibility as both a resource to be exploited for interactional ends and a constraint on that interaction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She cites a detailed subdivision of possible positions, from Karin Aijmer's 1986 paper "Why is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; so popular in spoken English?" (Tottie and Backlund, eds., &lt;em&gt;English in speech and writing&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Aijmer1986.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In principle, this ought to allow &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; to exhibit the subtle exuberance of &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt;, as in this example from a paper by Muffy Siegel that I &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000141.html"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; a few years go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;She isn't, like, really crazy or anything, but her and her, like, five buddies did, like, paint their hair a really fake-looking, like, purple color.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've only managed to find on the net a few embryonic examples on the web, all combining initial &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; with another one somewhere in the pre-verbal aux string (Google will give you the sources of these):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;actually she might have actually been her&lt;br&gt;
actually, erik actually got the rotate 0 bug licked&lt;br&gt;
Actually, she didn't actually run with the bulls.&lt;br&gt;
actually I never actually did care, either way, about things like that&lt;br&gt;
Well, actually, he's actually come out and substantiated it and said that was him and he was drunk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And unlike the cited multiple-&lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; example, these are all cases where the two instances of &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; have different functions. Of course, examples of multiple-actually with shared function are not hard to find — here the three instances of &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; are all intensifiers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Nathaniel Hawkins (one of the loveliest, funniest stylists ever to touch Paris Hilton's head) says the most important thing to getting an actually straight, actually unfrizzy, actually long-lasting blowout is that you MUST GET YOUR HAIR ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY, TOTALLY DRY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also not hard to find paired instances of &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; in subordinate and main clauses (full or small):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;…a strategy that might have actually worked had he actually done it once things got going.&lt;br&gt;
…do you think he might have actually spent some resources actually investigating the book&amp;#39;s claims…&lt;br&gt;
…you might have actually cooked something that actually tastes like food…&lt;br&gt;
…they might have actually found time to actually prove/disprove that subluxations exist…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There ought to be plenty of examples of final &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; combined with one in a medial position, or even multiple medial instances, e.g. "It was was not actually as enjoyable as it actually might have been, actually". No doubt some of you will be able to find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We intend for the peer-review web to do for scientific publishing what the world wide web has done for media publishing. As it becomes increasingly practical to evaluate researchers based on the reviews of their peers, the need for centralized big-name journals begins to diminish. The power is returned to those most qualified to give meaningful reviews: the peers. As long as big journals provide a useful service, this tool will only enhance their effectiveness. But the more they take months to review our publications, and the more they give unqualified reviews, and the more they force us to clear irrelevant hurdles prior to publication, and the more they lock up our works behind fees and copyright transfers, the more this tool will provide an alternative to their services. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;to endorse dialogue between different academic orientations;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to provide an innovative environment for concentrated study;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to encourage theoretical and methodological reflection in research;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to promote international visibility of Finnish research and interaction between scholars from all over the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year the Collegium offers a number of researcher positions concentrated on interdisciplinary work. Helsinki is the fifth closest university to where I live, and so I have applied a few times. I just received their reply to my most recent application. No luck so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To people who plan to apply for a job at the Collegium for Advanced Studies, some stats may be of interest. This year, 375 people applied for the 15 jobs. This means that, everything else being equal, your chance of getting a job is 4%, or less than half of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/10/research_council_grants_announ.php"&gt;chance of getting funding&lt;/a&gt; for research in the humanities from the Swedish Research Council. My project proposal got a decent grade from the reviewers, but in order to reach the top 4% you must of course score extremely high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I note with some sadness that neither of my two reviewers appears to have been an archaeologist. One opines that a project of interest only to scholars in Finland and the Nordic countries would have an "uncertain wider significance". This, of course, pretty much kills all archaeology practiced in the countries in question, since archaeology is at heart strongly regional. The other reviewer asks, with a real sense of curiosity, "Is metal detector survey a good method in archaeology?". Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my current knowledge no scholar in Scandinavian archaeology has ever got a job with the Collegium for Advanced Studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/helsinki_collegium_for_advance.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/ycqYFqKs_Nk" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234278469250"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-1646671176598388963">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bcf99ba1facb75be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Darwin" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">What Darwin didn't know.</title><published>2009-02-10T12:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-11T11:37:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/PdGMulKfet8/what-darwin-didnt-know.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=1646671176598388963" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/what-darwin-didnt-know.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">As you may know, I have be (re-)reading the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/span&gt; as part of a small discussion group made up of students from my most recent evolution course.  I am always struck by how much Darwin knew, not only in terms of his enormous collation of specific facts, but also of the concepts that he introduced that are still easily recognizable.  Read Chapters 3 and 4 of the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;, and you will encounter not only natural selection, but the basics of what we now call competitive exclusion, coevolution, r- and K-selection, succession, phylogenies, gene flow (minus the genes), and many others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, there is a lot (read: a LOT) that Darwin didn't, and couldn't, know.  How inheritance works, for example.  Not surprisingly, evolutionary theory has advanced enormously since Darwin's time, and many of his more specific ideas have been expanded, supplanted, or simply rejected.  For this reason, it is quite inaccurate to use "evolutionary biology" and "Darwinism" interchangeably, even without the fact that anti-evolutionists use the latter term for rhetorical purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While some have used the (obvious and inevitable) incompleteness of Darwin's early ideas &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-scientist-takes-hype-road.html"&gt;to sell magazines through sensationalism&lt;/a&gt;, I am nonetheless glad to see that others have taken a more measured approach in reminding readers that science has come a long way since 1859.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some examples...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/02/darwin-legacy/ridley-text"&gt;Modern Darwins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;by M.

It isn't necessary to remove Darwin from the picture, and it certainly remains appropriate to celebrate his 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;On the Origin of Species &lt;/span&gt;this year.   One excellent way of doing this is to actually read the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Origin &lt;/span&gt;and to take note both of what Darwin knew and what we have learned in the subsequent 150 years.&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/PdGMulKfet8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234277325258"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/other_people_get_email_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f7fa2d6b6b0d6bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">Other people get email</title><published>2009-02-10T13:06:07Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T13:06:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/eIpFU6uhtzI/other_people_get_email_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/other_people_get_email_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a bit jealous — I didn&amp;#39;t get &lt;a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/2009/02/from-the-mailbag-2.html"&gt;this amazing email&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for myself, I believe that science has proved that there has to be a creator (The best mathematicians, physicists, biologists, astronomers,etc all admit they cannot explain how the DNA data gets into each cell/gene and can only be put there by intelligent design. But a campaign of disinformation from the atheist scientific communtity was exposed on British TV (I have the documentary), that proves that even the atheists admitted in secret scientific unpublished journals that all organic life in the universe had to come from a designer creator, and cannot appear randomly. The documentary exposed these findings and carried the atheist scientists through to their final statement and conclusion (which was pretty weak) that all artificial intelligence can appear randomly, but they admit that all organic life has to have a creator. THAT WAS THE COVER UP! THIS WAS EXPOSED AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY WERE INFILTRATED BY OCCULT SECRET SOCIETIES AND PAID TO NOT PUBLISH THEIR FINDINGS. (MOSTLY HIGH RANKING FREEMASONS, ROSICRUCIANS, ORDER TEMPLAR ORIENTALIS,ETC). tHE DOCUMENTARY PART 2 STATES THAT 90% OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY DO NOT BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION BUT AGREE WITH CHRISTIANS SCIENTISTS THAT NATURAL SELECTION IS A CORRECT THESIS, BUT THEY CANNOT ADMIT THIS, BECAUSE THEIR FUNDS WILL BE STOPPED BY POWERFUL INSTITUTES CONTROLLED BY THESE OCCULT FREEMASONS/BUSINESSMEN WHO OWN MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is impressive, a classic kook-rant that hits all the high points: paranoia ("secret scientific unpublished journals"); conspiracy ("freemasons, rosicrucians, order templar orientalis"); delusions that a majority secretly agrees with them ("90% of the scientific community do not believe in evolution"); and of course, everything is completely made up. And the sudden ramp up into all-caps hysteria is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to have to add something to my to-do list, though: contact the freemasons and find out what happened to my checks. I've got about 30 years of outspoken evolutionism that I've been giving out for free, and they owe me big time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/other_people_get_email_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/eIpFU6uhtzI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234277121031"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5931">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7958bee391b084b1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 2.10</title><published>2009-02-10T14:22:33Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T14:22:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5931" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

This is a good one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, an astrologer has cast a horoscope for Randi and found he makes a good skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, &lt;em&gt;what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, this sort of thing has a potential for causing a catastrophic collapse of the space-irony continuum, but, assuming this is not satire, then prepare yourself for what must be the absolute, 100%, guaranteed rock-solid &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUXic3IKQEU"&gt;most ridiculous thing ever to have been attempted&lt;/a&gt; ever in the history of our Universe or any other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A synopsis &lt;a href="http://cindirenes.com/society/religion/horoscope-of-james-randi/" rel="nofollow"&gt;can be found here&lt;/a&gt;, too. But you might want to keep all sharp objects far away, and anything that might shatter when you start screaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, his basic synopsis is that Randi makes a good skeptic. Shocker, eh? So you see the problem: the astrologer knows about Randi, &lt;strong&gt;so he’s actually &lt;em&gt;predicting&lt;/em&gt; nothing!&lt;/strong&gt; He researches Randi &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; casting the horoscope, and then lo! Astrology predicted everything he found!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flZXJ-Ewsn4"&gt;Randi has a rebuttal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horoscope part starts about 5 minutes in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when things get really weird: turns out, &lt;em&gt;the astrologer was using the wrong birthdate for Randi!&lt;/em&gt; He was off by 20 days and an entire sun sign. So Randi gave him the actual birthdate, and the astrologer &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWjiSDnWK40"&gt;recast the horoscope with the new date and new sign&lt;/a&gt;. And guess what? Go on, guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He predicts Randi makes a good skeptic! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing (so to speak). Is that what you guessed? Astrology must be more powerful than I thought. All you have to do is already know everything about a person, and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; make your conclusions. My obvious mistake was putting all that emphasis on the whole &amp;quot;pre&amp;quot; part of the word &amp;quot;prediction&amp;quot;. I suppose it’s not so hard to make a prediction after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what have we learned here? Like the astrologer, we haven’t learned anything we didn’t already know. But maybe we do have more evidence for one thing…&lt;/p&gt;

Although this story is about Holocaust denial, the questions raised by it are applicable not only to history and Holocaust denial, but to any area of science or history subject to crankery. In other words, this story brought up questions that to me apply not just to the skeptical evaluation of Holocaust denial, but to skepticism and science in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To recap, that story is about &lt;a href="http://dinoscopus.blogspot.com/"&gt;Bishop Richard Williamson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four rogue bishops whose excommunication Pope Benedict XVI &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99878449"&gt;rescinded a couple of weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, opening the way, or so Benedict seemed to hope, to a reconciliation between the Catholic Church and the &lt;em&gt;über&lt;/em&gt;-conservative breakaway sect known as the &lt;a href="http://www.sspx.org/"&gt;Society of Saint Pius X&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, Benedict not only neglected to demand that these four bishops publicly acknowledge the legitimacy of the Second Vatican Council and its teachings and accept the authority of the Pope &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reversing their excommunication, but he and his vetters overlooked a rather glaring problem with Bishop Williamson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They overlooked that he has been an utterly anti-Semitic loon of a Holocaust denier for at least the last 20 years, so much so that he's &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/4388048/David-Irving-finds-a-kindred-spirit-in-Holocaust-questioning-bishop.html"&gt;buddies with David Irving&lt;/a&gt;. They even overlooked that Williamson had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/holocaust-denying_conservative_bishop.php"&gt;given an interview on Swedish television&lt;/a&gt; in November that &lt;a href="http://lipstadt.blogspot.com/2009/01/williamson-rebuttal-and-resource-sheet.html"&gt;demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt&lt;/a&gt; that he is an utterly anti-Semitic loon of a Holocaust denier. This interview probably would have faded into well-deserved obscurity along with most other verbal emissions of little-known cranks had it not been for timing most unfortunate (for him and the Pope). It turns out that Williamson's interview aired the &lt;a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,606422,00.html"&gt;same day that the the Pope signed the decree&lt;/a&gt; rescinding the four bishops' excommunications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D'oh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When last I wrote&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/better_late_than_never_the_vatican_demands.php"&gt; about this saga, Pope Benedict had demanded that Williamson publixly&lt;/a&gt; recant his Holocaust denial. Yesterday, it appears that Williamson is too anti-Semitic even for the SSPX, whose writings on its website drip with anti-Semitism. Apparently, however, Holocaust denial is just too &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,489784,00.html"&gt;much even for the SSPX&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/bishop_richard_williamson_holocaust_deni.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/bishop_richard_williamson_holocaust_deni.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/uLpSJpu5mcw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234272443708"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1121">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/419eb24383067b16</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Syntax"/><title type="html">Dentist fear girl?</title><published>2009-02-10T13:17:35Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T13:17:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1121" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A headline in today's &lt;i&gt;Metro&lt;/i&gt; (a UK free newspaper) looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dentist fear girl&lt;br&gt;starved to death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback: it looked decidedly ungrammatical for quite a few seconds.  And another reader, from Glasgow, has already mailed me to say the same thing.  What is wrong with the headline?  Or can it be parsed as grammatical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is not that &lt;i&gt;dentist&lt;/i&gt; is the subject of a clause in which &lt;i&gt;fear&lt;/i&gt; is the verb.  There is no way to account for the lack of either a 3rd person present tense ending &lt;i&gt;-s&lt;/i&gt; or a preterite tense ending &lt;i&gt;-ed&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;fear&lt;/i&gt; in that case. And there is no way to read &lt;i&gt;dentist&lt;/i&gt; as plural.  So it is not about dentists (or a dentist) fearing that a girl starved.  That is a wrong turning up the garden path.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is that &lt;i&gt;dentist fear&lt;/i&gt; is a compound noun (meaning "fear of dentists") that is being used as an attributive modifier to another noun, &lt;i&gt;girl&lt;/i&gt;.  The only ungrammaticality (and it's fine in the context of a headline) is the lack of a determiner on the resultant singular noun phrase.  The verb of the clause is &lt;i&gt;starved&lt;/i&gt;. The story is about a young girl who developed a pathological fear of dentists (hence she could be referred to in headlinese as the dentist fear girl) and refused to open her mouth at all after an operation to remove her milk teeth.  She wouldn't eat; the parents' entreaties for medical help or advice went unheeded; and she died of malnutrition. A very sad story given what modern medicine is capable of.  But the headline describing it, once you get the right parse, is fully grammatical.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Unlike many physicists, I’m not a big skier, or a hiker, preferring to get my exercise through ball sports and in the gym, and so I don’t love Aspen in the way that many people do. But I do really like the Center, and I always have great physics conversations there, learn a lot, and am able to actually get work done. So I had been looking forward to our workshop for a while, and I wasn’t disappointed at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference spanned five days. We flew in on Sunday in time to register and have dinner, and then got started properly on the Monday morning. At many conferences, academic and otherwise, the day is full of sessions, and then the evenings are free. At Aspen, in the winter, this is modified somewhat, with the mornings, late afternoons and evenings full of sessions, and the middle part of the day free so that people can ski if they want to. We spend the same amount of time working as at a regular conference, but the time is just distributed differently. This last week, it was good that I don’t ski, since I had let a number of important deadlines slip to the point that I had to work each afternoon. I did have a great view while I was doing it though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our speakers covered a wide range of topics, experimental, observational and theoretical, covering dark matter and cosmic acceleration separately, as well as the possible interactions between them. I can’t possibly discuss all of the topic or talks here (but you can take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~rbean/Aspen/AspenSchedule.pdf"&gt;a slightly outdated program&lt;/a&gt;), but let me pick out one talk that particularly caught my attention, and one event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first morning we kicked off with a very nice talk by &lt;a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dfinkbei/"&gt;Doug Finkbeiner&lt;/a&gt; (Harvard), discussing his (and others’) &lt;a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/0810.0713"&gt;recent work&lt;/a&gt; constructing a particle physics model of dark matter that is designed to account for the &lt;a href="http://pamela.roma2.infn.it/index.php"&gt;PAMELA&lt;/a&gt; and ATIC results. This was followed by later theoretical talks on related topics by &lt;a href="http://home.fnal.gov/~dhooper/"&gt;Dan Hooper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://physics.uoregon.edu/physics/faculty/kribs.html"&gt;Graham Kribs&lt;/a&gt;.The PAMELA results were a recurring theme at the workshop, and there were plenty of discussions in the free time and over dinner about the results themselves, their interpretation, and the models that a number of groups have constructed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One talk that I particularly enjoyed was by &lt;a href="https://editweb.lsa.umich.edu/umich/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=23d93453fd616110VgnVCM1000009db1d38dRCRD&amp;amp;vgnextchannel=350e6b0ae62fd110VgnVCM100000a3b1d38dRCRD"&gt;Greg Tarle&lt;/a&gt; (Michigan), who gave an (originally unplanned) talk on the immense challenge of making the precise measurements that these quite beautiful experiments claim. From my perspective what was wonderful about Greg’s talk was that although he presented quite a few experimental details in the latter half, he constructed the first half in such a way as to get across some of the key things for theorists to keep in mind while they are rightfully getting excited by the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I took away from it (although any mistakes here are naturally due to me, and not to Greg) is that, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/04/looking-for-dark-matter-in-all-the-wrong-places/"&gt;as we’ve discussed before&lt;/a&gt;, the big deal for PAMELA (and the earlier HEAT experiment) is an accurate measurement of the flux of cosmic ray positrons. The single largest challenge in measuring these is discriminating against the vast proton background, since protons have the same charge as positrons and are copious in cosmic rays. Ideally one needs to be able to reject the proton signal at the 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; level. If this is done completely reliably and the dramatic rise of the spectrum at high energies persists, then we may indeed be seeing a signature of dark matter annihilation, or something more mundane, like nearby pulsars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it is possible that the signal is due to protons leaking in. Obviously, the key to figuring this out is particle identification. One point of caution Greg pointed out is that on PAMELA, the particle ID is solely dependent on calorimetry. Greg certainly wasn’t saying that he believes that the PAMELA signal is contaminated, but he did want to point out how a possible contamination might lead to an erroneous result. In his talk, to demonstrate this, he showed how to reproduce the observed effect (at high energies) with a model of proton contamination at the 3×10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; level. Note though, that PAMELA claims proton rejection at the 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; level, but one can at least get a simple idea of what a small error might yield. Again, I as a theorist can’t comment on this at all, and my understanding is that the PAMELA experiment is an excellent one. Still, it is nice to have a feeling for the possible issues involved. All should be settled by &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/main/index.html"&gt;FERMI&lt;/a&gt; (GLAST) hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Tuesday evening we had a couple of public events as part of the workshop. In the first, &lt;a href="http://home.fnal.gov/~dhooper/"&gt;Dan Hooper&lt;/a&gt;, particle phenomenologist, dark matter expert and &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1221023426/ref=sr_nr_n_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;rs=1000&amp;amp;bbn=75&amp;amp;rnid=1000&amp;amp;rh=i%3Astripbooks%2Cp%5F27%3ADan%20Hooper%2Cn%3A75"&gt;author extraordinaire&lt;/a&gt;, teamed up with me to conduct a &lt;a href="http://aspensciencecenter.org/asc/physics-cafes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physics Cafe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the mezzanine of the Wheeler Opera House. I’m awful at estimating numbers, but I’d say somewhere between fifty and a hundred people, members of the public who either live in or were visiting Aspen, turned up to ask us any kinds of questions they liked about particle physics and cosmology. This was terrific fun, and we got some wonderful questions, my personal favorite of which was “What does entropy have to do with gravity?” Not something to which one can give a full answer (in public or professionally), but a great chance to talk about the general issues that gravity raises for thermodynamics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I participate in a lot of events like these, and one thing that never ceases to surprise me is the general perception that scientists treat theories like general relativity as received wisdom, about which one should not ask questions. Dan and I had to go out of our way to explain that science is, in fact, about challenging ideas, and forcing them to stand up to evidence and scrutiny. This is not the fault of the audience, of course, but reflects the way in which I think science is often taught and portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly after this, also at the &lt;a href="http://www.wheeleroperahouse.com/wheeler/"&gt;Wheeler Opera House&lt;/a&gt;, my new colleague &lt;a href="http://www.physics.upenn.edu/people/b.jain.html"&gt;Bhuvnesh Jain&lt;/a&gt; gave a wonderful public lecture on &lt;em&gt;Einstein Rings and Giant Arcs: Mapping Dark Matter with Gravitational Lensing&lt;/em&gt; to a large and lively audience. Bhuv has some great animations and movies, plus some fun props - &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2007/03/31/lensing-in-the-laboratory/"&gt;optical lenses that are machined to reproduce the effects of gravitational lenses&lt;/a&gt; - and he did an admirable job of the lecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own talk at the workshop was as part of a trio of talks, the other two of which were delivered by my collaborator &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~rbean/"&gt;Rachel Bean&lt;/a&gt; and her student &lt;a href="http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/~laszloi/"&gt;Istvan Laszlo&lt;/a&gt;. I spoke about work with Rachel and &lt;a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/~flanagan/"&gt;Eanna Flanagan&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/spires/find/hep/www?rawcmd=FIND+A+TRODDEN+AND+A+FLANAGAN+and+not+a+laszlo&amp;amp;FORMAT=www&amp;amp;SEQUENCE="&gt;adiabatic instabilities in coupled dark matter-dark energy models&lt;/a&gt;, and Istvan and Rachel covered different parts of &lt;a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/0808.1105"&gt;a longer paper&lt;/a&gt; the three of us co-authored with Flanagan a few months ago, mapping out general constraints on such couplings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I have a seminar at &lt;a href="http://www.phys.psu.edu/"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; to give on this topic on Wednesday, and I should probably get to finishing that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundamentalists Exploit Catastrophe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia has been in shock since the Victorian bushfires in early February, resulting in the destruction of almost one thousand homes and the deaths of hundreds of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some offer practical relief in the form of food and clothing donations, others look for someone to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catch the Fire Ministries (CTFM) in Dandenong, Victoria, published a media release today, blaming a new Australian law for the devastating bushfires, and further claim that the fires were foretold in a spiritual vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTFM leader, Pastor Danny Nalliah, announced that he had predicted the bushfires in a dream he had in October 2008. In this dream, he had a prophesy that the fires would occur, as divine retribution for an abortion decriminalisation bill that passed in Victoria in 2008. Nalliah calls Victoria the “baby killing state of Australia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/dannynalliah420-420x0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="dannynalliah420-420x0" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/dannynalliah420-420x0-300x190.jpg" alt="Danny Nalliah" width="300" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny Nalliah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ministry’s response is to petition God for forgiveness, and to commence a seven day prayer and fasting campaign. “In our prayer and fasting campaign, we are particularly repenting for the passing of the “Decriminalization of Abortion Laws of Victoria” in addition to other unrighteous, ungodly, and unjust laws and practices which have seen a holocaust of some of the most helpless members of the human race, the unborn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can we stop the fires? Yes we can! But it will take God’s children to rally together and repent and cry unto Him as in 2 Chronicles 7:14 (The Holy Bible). We at CTFM have seen this happen several times in the past in Australia, which was also covered by many mainstream media outlets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CTFM website calls upon the “Australian Bible-believing God-fearing Christians to repent and call upon the Lord Jesus Christ for His mercy and protection over Australia once again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the CTFM &lt;a href="http://catchthefire.com.au/blog/2009/02/10/media-release-abortion-laws-to-blame-for-bush-fires/#comment-259305"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; can comment on the media release. However, skeptical replies are immediately deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the Australian Skeptics condemn the Catch the Fire Ministry for their uncritical, discriminatory beliefs and exploitation of the tragic events to promote their ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footnote: Pastor Danny Nalliah claims he had this dream on October 21st. Any reason why he didn’t warn us?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few highlights from an &lt;a href="http://www.esa.org/pao/policyNews/pn2009/02052009.php"&gt;Ecological Society of America Press Release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;em&gt;The bill would establish a new risk assessment process in which the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) would evaluate the risk posed by nonnative species before allowing them into the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;H.R. 669 therefore represents a key shift from reactive to proactive policy, allowing FWS to stop nonnative species invasions in many cases before they begin. &lt;/strong&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to know more about the costs and impacts of invasive species, The ESA issued a position paper  in 2006 (&lt;a href="http://www.esa.org/pao/policyStatements/pdfDocuments/bioIvasions2006.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;).  Listing the thousands of invasive species that cost an estimated $138 Billion/year in control and damage would take too long–I’ll just invite you to surf around and note how many pests were imported as &lt;a href="http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/aquatics/snakehead.shtml"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Burmese python" href="http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1875"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/bittersweet.shtml"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/chintallow.shtml"&gt;ornamentals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly predictably, &lt;a href="http://acaforum.com/index.php?act=Print&amp;amp;client=printer&amp;amp;f=40&amp;amp;t=3448"&gt;owners&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.geckoforums.net/showthread.php?p=320108"&gt;exotic pets&lt;/a&gt; are (again) &lt;a href="http://moreliaviridis.yuku.com/topic/10166"&gt;sounding&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href="http://www.dendroboard.com/forum/general-discussion/36681-would-bad.html"&gt;alarm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stated last time: This law will regulate &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; introductions of species. Not species that are already established here in the US. It also calls for a “white list” of already introduced exotics that may be continued to be imported, since they are judged to not be harmful, or have potential to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one will come and grab your snake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exotic plants and animals are interesting, beautiful creatures, and lots of fun to own. But they can also, despite our best intentions, &lt;a title="lionfish" href="http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/aquatics/lionfish.shtml"&gt;escape&lt;/a&gt; and become &lt;a title="clawed frogs" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=5529272"&gt;terribly destructive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the stimulus Kerfuffle is over, I encourage you to contact your Representatives and get this bill on the House floor and passed to the Senate.  Don’t let the pet industry kill it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;I was working with &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Saunders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on layout of the next issue of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; magazine when Richard gasped so loudly that I was sure he’d found out that I once slept with John Edward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;Then I found out what really happened, and it was much, much worse…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;img title="wwwabccomau" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wwwabccomau.jpg?w=252&amp;amp;h=168" alt="wwwabccomau" width="252" height="168"&gt;Heard about the current &lt;a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/latest/5312864/death-toll-approaching-200-1000-homes-destroyed/"&gt;bushfires&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Australia&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;A group of Christian Fundamentalists, aptly named &lt;a href="http://catchthefire.com.au"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catch the Fire Ministries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, posted a media release on their site, wherein they &lt;em&gt;irrationally blame a new pro-choice abortion law for the bushfires&lt;/em&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;Not arsonists, not summer, not extremely high temperatures, but a law that allows abortion in the state of Victoria, where the fires are occurring…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;Tragically, almost one thousand houses have burned to the ground, hundreds of people have died…and these assholes think that abortion is to blame, that the fires are God’s punishment, and that prayer is the answer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;This reminded me of those who blamed &lt;a href="http://www.nola.com/katrina/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurricane Katrina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the licentiousness and debauchery of &lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;I promptly issued the following press release to a range of sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christians Exploit Catastrophe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Australia has been in shock  since the Victorian bushfires in early February, resulting in the destruction of  almost one thousand homes and the deaths of hundreds of people. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;While some offer practical  relief in the form of food and clothing donations, others look for someone to  blame. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catch the Fire Ministries&lt;/strong&gt; (CTFM)  in Dandenong, Victoria, published a &lt;a href="http://catchthefire.com.au/blog/2009/02/10/media-release-abortion-laws-to-blame-for-bush-fires/"&gt;media release&lt;/a&gt; today, blaming a new  Australian law for the devastating bushfires, and further claim that the fires  were foretold in a spiritual vision. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CTFM leader, &lt;strong&gt;Pastor Danny  Nalliah&lt;/strong&gt;, announced that he had predicted the bushfires in a dream he had in  October 2008. In this dream, he had a prophesy that the fires would occur, as  divine retribution for an abortion decriminalization bill that passed in  Victoria in 2008. Nalliah calls Victoria the “baby killing state of Australia.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ministry’s response is to petition God for forgiveness, and to commence a  seven day prayer and fasting campaign. “In our prayer and fasting campaign, we  are particularly repenting for the passing of the “Decriminalization of Abortion  Laws of Victoria” in addition to other unrighteous, ungodly, and unjust laws and  practices which have seen a holocaust of some of the most helpless members of  the human race, the unborn.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Can we stop the fires? Yes we can! But it will take God’s children to rally  together and repent and cry unto Him as in 2 Chronicles 7:14 (The Holy Bible).  We at CTFM have seen this happen several times in the past in Australia, which  was also covered by many mainstream media outlets.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CTFM website calls upon the  “Australian Bible-believing God-fearing Christians to repent and call upon the  Lord Jesus Christ for His mercy and protection over Australia once again.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visitors to the CTFM website&lt;a href="http://catchthefire.com.au/blog/2009/02/10/media-release-abortion-laws-to-blame-for-bush-fires/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can comment on the media release. However, skeptical replies are immediately  deleted. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Representatives of the  Australian Skeptics condemn the Catch the Fire Ministry for their uncritical,  discriminatory beliefs and exploitation of the tragic events to promote their  ministry. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;Richard and I spent the afternoon submitting comments to their site, which were promptly censored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin:0 0 10pt"&gt;So we started spreading the news…&lt;/p&gt;

He is very long on rhetoric and very short on facts and logic.  He does not raise any new points that have not already been demolished many times over (hence the title of this post). But, this week I want to blog about creation and evolution since it is the 150th anniversary of the publication of Origin of Species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the comment, posted under the name “truthseeker” but who blogs under John Andrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Egnor addresses you guys as “Darwinists” because there’s no better name for you. Darwinists are really atheists who justify their atheism by attributing everything but the kitchen sink to Darwin. What other explanation could there be for the manic pursuit of a dogma that is attributed to a mere human being. Darwin was not a god, yet he is revered as such by you guys. As a mere man, he erred. Yet you geniuses seem unwilling to acknowledge that as a possibility. You are unreasonable, and unreasoning. You are incapable of respectful dialogue with those who have differing views. There’s a saying that if you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Could that be the reason the evidence SEEMS to stack up in your favor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a scientist, but I have read a bit, and I am very much interested in evaluating all ideas according to their merit. I have uncovered questions and challenges to the scientist/naturalist/atheist/whateveryouwanttocallyourself dogma. I wrote a series on my blog, and I was challenged a few times. Yet each time I responded with calm reason, asking questions that seemed to challenge Darwinian dogma, my challengers simply disengaged. All they seemed interested in was yelling, cursing, deriding and name-calling. Once I challenged them to defend their positions rationally, they simply disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop on by and take a look. See if you can answer my questions in the spirit of truth-seeking. That means reason with me. If you think I don’t get it, explain it to me. &lt;a href="http://andj4613.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://andj4613.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always be suspicious of those who try to grab the mantle of “truth.”  It seems to be a reliable red flag for nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get to some of the meat of  John’s claims, I want to point out his hysterical propaganda above. He claims that he is only interested in a calm and respectful dialogue, but that those who leave comments on his blog just want to rant and then disappear when challenged. Reading the blog and comments, however, leaves me with the impression that John’s confirmation bias is bordering on delusional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very content of his comment here is not calm and rational. He spends most of his time constructing pathetic straw men against which to rant. To him scientists who accept the overwhelming evidence for evolution are dogmatic, worship Darwin (for whatever reason) and are just desperately trying to justify their atheism. He does not appear to have made any attempt to understand evolution, its history, or the arguments for it. This is not the comment of someone who wants a serious dialogue with those who understand evolution, and who seeks the “truth” whatever it might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The points that he thinks are so devastating against evolution and from which “Darwinists” run are just recycled old arguments that have already been exposed. In fact, just yesterday I &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/02/09/ten-major-flaws-of-evolution-a-refutation/"&gt;reposted at SkepticBlog&lt;/a&gt; an updated version of my answers to “Ten Major Flaws of Evolution.” John’s points are mostly covered here - and John does not seem to be aware that his points have already been refuted, and he has no answer to those refutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to cover yet again the points I addressed yesterday - that post will serve as part of my response to John. For example he repeats (this one never ceases to amaze me) the claim that there are no transitional fossils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did want to focus on two points - the first is the Cambrian Explosion (because this is not covered in my other post). &lt;a href="http://andj4613.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/what-darwin-got-wrong/#comments"&gt;John says on his blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infamous “Cambrian Explosion” shows large numbers of new and much more complex species appearing within a very short period of time, seemingly out of nowhere.  And it was accompanied by a major diversification of other organisms, including animals, phytoplankton, and calcimicrobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John does not say what a “very short period of time” is. When talking about something that happened 540 million years ago, and about evidence that exists in the geological record, a little clarification is in order. The Cambrian “explosion” was only sudden in geological time scales. It lasted from 10-50 million years, depending upon how you break it up. But even at the low estimate - 10 million years - that’s a long time, sufficient to allow substantial evolutionary change. But by using the term “short period of time” without any context or clarification, John attempted to create a false impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the Cambrian really represents is the first appearance of hard parts that can fossilize in multicellular life. This is consistent with what we expect - multicellular life arose at some point from single-celled ancestors. Those first multicellular creatures would not have fossilized well. When the adaptation of shells and other hard elements occurred, then such creatures start to appear in the fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we would then predict that there might be trace evidence of pre-Cambrian multicellular life, before hard parts appeared. And in fact there is - coprolites, worm casings, and other secondary trace evidence has been found. Just last week, in fact, &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUKTRE5135FA20090204"&gt;scientists published evidence&lt;/a&gt; of chemical traces of multicellular life from 635 million years ago. Again - this is what we would expect - multicellular life was evolving for tens of millions of years before they evolved hard parts that can fossilize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point I want to cover is that of common descent. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal common descent was a &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;huge leap of faith&lt;/span&gt; he (Darwin) made that connected two other observations - that species seemed to appear in the fossil record without explanation, and that species tended to become more complex over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much wrong with this. From a historical point of view, common descent did not originate with Darwin.  It was recognized long before Darwin that life seemed to fit into a tree of relatedness. Lamarck spent his career trying to discern the structure of that tree, starting with the hypothesis that it would show a directional trend revealing the inherent force driving evolution. What he found, rather, was a chaotic tree of branching descent with no direction - just adaptation to local environments. To his great credit he changed his thinking in response to this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Darwin the evidence for common descent has only grown, and is now overwhelming. It is perhaps the most supported scientific fact there is (it’s at least one of the most supported). Multiple independent lines of evidence, from anatomy, the fossil record, geology, developmental biology, and genetics - not only support common descent, but the same picture of common descent. This is a remarkable consilience of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these independent lines of evidence the genetic and molecular evidence is the strongest, because it is the most statistically rigorous. In fact daedalus2u (a frequent commenter on this blog as well) pointed this out in the comments to John’s blog - in direct contradiction to John’s own characterization above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize the main points - proteins are chains of amino acids. There are many different possible arrangements of amino acids that can result in a functionally identical protein, because many amino acids (out of the 20 that make up life) are interchangeable. In addition, there is a redundant genetic code - three base pairs code for each amino acid, and there are several 3-base pair combinations for each amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, what this means is that there are potential differences in the sequence of base pairs and in the sequence of amino acids that make absolutely no difference to the final protein -none, zipp, nada.  Combine this with the fact that point mutations (changes in a single base pair) happen at a roughly regular rate over evolutionary time. Those mutations that do not make any functional difference are invisible to natural selection - they cannot be selected against. Therefore they should randomly accumulate over evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution makes a specific prediction about what we would therefore see when we look at protein and genetic information in various species. If common descent is correct then we would expect to see that the closer two species appear to be (by morphology, fossil record, etc.) the fewer random mutations they will display between related proteins. The hemoglobin in a chimp should be more similar to the hemoglobin in a human than a gorilla’s, which will be more similar than a horse’s, which will be more similar than a lizard’s, which will be more similar than a fish - etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should therefore be able to reconstruct the tree of life from looking at any protein that is broadly distributed. Also, you should construct the same tree of life no matter what protein you look at. This is exactly what we find - and this represents overwhelmingly powerful confirmation of common descent. This pattern could not have occurred by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John does not seem to understand this argument. He writes in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to say, first of all, that I appreciate the calm, instructive tone you took. As a non-scientist, I admit I did not fully appreciate much of your comment, but it seems that you attribute the similarity of DNA design to common descent. Although that seems possible, you have not addressed whether those same design features could have been attributed to a common designer, rather than a common ancestor - or whether they descended from a common ancestor which itself was created by a single designer. Could they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John’s question is the common response to the evidence for common descent - how do we know life does not look similar because of the common designer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this misses the point (and even though daedalus2u explains it further, John never gives any evidence of grasping this evidence).  It’s not just that the proteins look similar - the pattern of similarity reveals branching descent - and the same branching descent for every protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a designer created species roughly as they are, what would be the pattern of differences in genes and proteins? Creationists don’t have an answer for this, and that is why creationism and ID are not testable - they refuse to put their nickle down on any prediction that can falsify their beliefs.  But that point aside, what might we predict from a designer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, once a designer created a functional hemoglobin there would not be any reason to change it, so we might expect that every species with hemoglobin would have the exact same amino acid and base pair sequence as every other. Remember, you cannot say that this is necessary for function - we are talking about changes that have no effect on function. We do not see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you might say that they would be nearly identical, but that point mutations since creation have created differences. In this case, however, every species would be just as different as every other species. If you compared any two species you would find roughly the same number of mutations different between them - since all species are the same distance from creation. We do not see this pattern, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you could say that the designer wanted to give each species their own special version of hemoglobin, and that is why they are all slightly different. But then there would be absolutely no reason for there to be any relationship between the apparent degree of evolutionary relatedness and the degree of molecular relatedness. In some protein horses might be more similar to humans than chimps, while in others humans might be closer to the puffer fish. But we don’t see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we see is a pattern of relatedness that is exquisitely evolutionary. It is only compatible with common descent. The only other logical possibility is that a designer specifically varied every gene and protein to create the impression of common descent - an unfalsifiable and therefore unscientific proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, either creation makes no prediction (not science), or it makes predictions that have been falsified (in which case it is simply wrong, which is a step up from not being science at all). Meanwhile, evolution makes specific predictions that have been validated to such a degree that to deny it would be perverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In John’s fantasy world - which is distressingly similar to most creationists I have encountered - I and scientists in general accept evolution because we dogmatically and mindlessly worship Darwin. Never mind that scientists have thoughtfully debated every angle, brought up numerous objections, and searched for highly detailed evidence that could have falsified evolution many times over. Never mind that on this very blog I have constructed many detailed and evidence-based arguments for exactly why I accept evolution as the best theory to date to explain life.  To John and his ilk he can dismiss it all as “dogma”, while simultaneously whining about the dismissive attitude of “Darwinists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say that I am picking on some random creationist blogger (ignoring the fact that he came to my blog to challenge me) and his views are not representative of the best creationists have to offer. However, this is simply not true. John’s arguments are retreads of the same arguments the creationist community - including the best and brightest among them - have been harping on for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is an open challenge to John (and any other creationist). Set aside your self-serving rhetoric about dogma, and answer the evidence I have just laid before you.  I say this is a home-run for common descent. I challenge you to demonstrate that you understand the evidence and offer another viable scientific explanation for it other than common descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either that or admit, at least as far as the scientific evidence is concerned, common descent is the only currently viable conclusion. Then we can move on from there.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study published in the February 9th online edition of the &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt; reports that mice with mutations in two genes, &lt;a href="http://www.geneticsandhealth.com/2006/05/04/pten-gene-and-autism/"&gt;PTEN&lt;/a&gt; and the serotonin transporter gene, both of which are "autism susceptibility genes," presented with more severe autism-like symptoms than did mice with only a single mutation, as noted in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2009/02/09/2-genes-implicated-in-autism.html"&gt;US News &amp;amp; World Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/08/AR2009020801853.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; considers the role of "nature vs. nurture" in child development in an article on &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/08/AR2009020801853.html?sid=ST2009020801877&amp;amp;s_pos="&gt;in vitro fertilization&lt;/a&gt; based on research published in the February 2nd &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/02/02/0808798106.full.pdf+html?sid=7f44c659-2c70-4c64-a93b-c820b95fdc2b"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.  An accompanying &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/02/06/DI2009020602919.html"&gt;Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/a&gt; with Washington Post staff writer Rob Stein and one of the authors of the study, &lt;a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/"&gt;Cardiff University&lt;/a&gt; researcher Frances Rice, contains the following exchange about autism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Gabriel, Calif.:&lt;/em&gt; Does nature or nurture play a dominant role in explaining the 4 to 1 ratio of autism in male children vs. female children? In other words, what explains the occurrence of autism at a much higher incidence in male children than in female children? Anything to do with mothering patterns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frances Rice:&lt;/em&gt; This is an interesting question as you rightly say, boys are much more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls. This increased prevalence in males is also true for other neurodevelopmental problems as well as for autism . It is difficult to say whether nature or nurture is more important. Clearly, inherited factors are important in autism - twin studies show that it is highly heritable but other factors contribute. Researchers in Cambridge, UK have a theory that the amount of &lt;a href="http://autismresearchcentre.com/research/project.asp?id=13"&gt;testosterone that babies are exposed to in the womb&lt;/a&gt; may be important. However, this is currently a theory and even if it is found that early exposure to testosterone is important in explaining the gender difference, it does not rule out the importance of nature - because if could be that babies who later develop autism are more sensitive to the effects of testosterone in the womb. Other research involves looking at the sex chromosomes to see if differences there can account for the gender difference. Howevever, mothering patterns do not seem to be important with respect to the causes of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm curious to know more of where the commenter from San Gabriel was coming from in asking her or his question. While the nature/nurture question is often framed as "genetics vs. the environment" in discusssions of autism causation, in the not so distant past, the question of "nurture" and autism pointed to the "&lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/remembering-refrigerator-mothers-on-mothers-day/"&gt;refrigerator mother&lt;/a&gt;" theory of autism. According to this altogether discredited theory, a child became autistic because her or his parents, and her or his mother in particular, were emotionally reserved and "frigid," and failed to bond. The result was a child who withdrew into her or himself and appeared to lack all affect and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/02/02/0808798106.full.pdf+html?sid=7f44c659-2c70-4c64-a93b-c820b95fdc2b"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that prompted the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/08/AR2009020801853.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; article looks specifically at children conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF) to see if children whose mothers smoked while they were pregnant were at an increased risk of developing behavior problems because of the "toxic effects of smoking," or because "their mothers passed on a genetic predisposition to antisocial behavior."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurture, or nature?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/08/AR2009020801853.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; notes that Rice and colleagues&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;......came up with the idea of studying babies born to women undergoing IVF. In some cases, such women are genetically related to their babies because they use their own eggs to create embryos with their husband's sperm. But others have babies who are not genetically related to them because they use eggs or embryos donated by unrelated women. In both cases, the women carry the developing children in their wombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thapar and her colleagues studied 779 children, ages 4 to 10, including about 533 who were genetically related to their mothers and 195 who were not. The researchers examined whether those whose mothers smoked were more likely to have been born underweight and whether they developed behavioral problems, such as temper tantrums or frequent fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If it's the cigarette smoke having a toxic effect on the brain, it shouldn't matter -- you'd see the relationship with the child's behavior regardless of whether the child is related or unrelated to the mothers who smoke," [Anita] Thapar [professor of &lt;a href="http://www.caerdydd.ac.uk/medic/aboutus/departments/psychologicalmedicine/psychiatryspecialties/childpsychiatry/index.html"&gt;child and adolescent psychiatry at Cardiff University&lt;/a&gt;] said. "But it's not random whether mothers smoke or not. There are a lot of contributing factors, including mothers' personalities. What if it's those factors that are contributing to the behaviors and not the actual smoking?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the babies whose mothers smoked were much more likely to be born underweight, regardless of whether they were genetically related to the mothers, the researchers reported last week in the &lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/02/02/0808798106.full.pdf+html?sid=7f44c659-2c70-4c64-a93b-c820b95fdc2b"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. That shows a clear biological effect of smoking on birth weight, regardless of genetics. But antisocial behavior was more common only in children who were genetically related to mothers who smoked, indicating that a genetic influence was at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, researchers at the &lt;a href="http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/"&gt;UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://marbles.ucdavis.edu/"&gt;MARBLES Project&lt;/a&gt; are studying &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/looking-for-autisms-causes-at-home/"&gt;possible pre-natal and post-partum environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; that may "contribute to the development of autism." Researchers are collecting blood, urine, hair, saliva, and breast milk (if the mother is breast feeding), as well as dust from participants’ houses, and interviewing mothers of autistic children who are expecting another child, or who are planning to have another child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if (speculating here and emphasizing that I'm no scientist) rates of autism or other developmental delays were tracked in children born to mothers who they were genetically related to, and in children born to mothers who they were not genetically related to.......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this still leaves the deeper question hanging, namely, why does it seem so important, so crucial, so pressing, for some to emphasize and state that autism "happened" to them as the result of some external force? Why such a search to locate autism's causes outside and beyond the parents? To say that one's autistic child is totally and utterly &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; from one; that autism is some anomaly----even an  "un-natural" occurrence?&lt;/p&gt;

Billboards, signs on the sides of buses, chiropractic victims’ organizations, and lawsuits are telling the world that chiropractic neck adjustments can cause strokes. The risk is very small, but it is very real. We have addressed the subject before on this blog &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=94"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=152"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=170"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiropractors are in denial and are trying to shift the blame elsewhere. A correspondent sent me copies of a pamphlet and a “distribution kit” that the &lt;a href="http://www.fcer.org/"&gt;FCER (Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research)&lt;/a&gt; is selling to chiropractors so they can inform the public about cervical artery dissection (CAD). It is advertised as a campaign to help the public recognize warning signs of stroke; but in my opinion, it amounts to a cynical, self-serving ploy to divert attention away from neck manipulation and to spread biased information about the recent study in &lt;em&gt;Spine&lt;/em&gt; by Cassidy et al. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=170"&gt;Dr. Crislip has already eviscerated the Cassidy study &lt;/a&gt;so I will only describe it briefly here. It compared patients who had had a vertebral artery stroke to controls and looked at health billing records to see if they had visited a doctor or a chiropractor in the previous year. Patients with strokes were more likely than controls to have seen a provider but they were not more likely to have seen a chiropractor than to have seen a doctor before their hospitalization. They concluded “The increased risks of VBA [vertebrobasilar artery] stroke associated with chiropractic and PCP [primary care provider] visits is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from VBA dissection seeking care before their stroke.” This is nothing but speculation and is not supported in any way by the data in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cassidy study did not even try to determine whether patients who saw chiropractors had their necks manipulated. It was not designed to answer the real question: whether rapid thrust neck adjustments can cause strokes in patients who would not otherwise have strokes. The answer to that question is clearly “yes.” We have plenty of “smoking gun” case reports of patients who had no symptoms of stroke until their neck was rapidly manipulated by a chiropractor and who were subsequently found to have tears in the vertebral artery, often bilaterally. There is a plausible mechanism related to the anatomy and the way the artery is tethered between two bony restrictions and stretched by rotation/extension. When a healthy asymptomatic young person collapses on the chiropractor’s table immediately after a neck adjustment and is found to have torn arteries, there can be little doubt about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that chiropractic strokes are under-reported: &lt;a href="http://www.chirobase.org/08Legal/nette.html"&gt;Sandra Nette’s class action suit&lt;/a&gt; is being joined by victims who had not previously reported their experiences, and one of my neighbors recently had a mild stroke after a chiropractic neck adjustment and will never see a chiropractor again but he did not sue and his case was not reported in any medical journal. I don’t think he even went back to tell the chiropractor what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCER kit includes a patient template letter, an attorney template, an MD template, and a media release template designed to be personalized with the individual chiropractor’s name and printed on his letterhead and sent out with a copy of the pamphlet. They say the chiropractic profession [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] is trying to reduce the incidence of stroke from treatment by educating practitioners and patients about the warning signs of CAD and that both medical and chiropractic treatment (spread the blame!) of neck and head pain “can make the problem worse” when those symptoms are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are logically inconsistent: they say they are trying to reduce the incidence of stroke “from treatment,” but at the same time they are saying a vertebral artery dissection (essentially a stroke in progress) was already present before treatment and symptoms of head and neck pain from stroke were the reason patients sought treatment. They seem to be admitting that neck adjustments can cause strokes but at the same time they are implying that the beginnings of the stroke preceded the treatment, so the treatment isn’t really responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research in the journal &lt;em&gt;Spine&lt;/em&gt;, which showed that patients seeking inappropriate treatment for CAD – regardless of whether treatment was delivered by a medical or chiropractic doctor – were are [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] at risk for stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a complete misrepresentation of the study, which did not differentiate between strokes due to CAD and strokes caused by other mechanisms, did not present any evidence that patients who sought care already had CAD, and did not even record what symptoms led patients to seek care or what treatments were given. And of course it couldn’t show that patients were “seeking inappropriate treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, &lt;em&gt;Spine&lt;/em&gt; would issue a statement that their study was being mis-represented and mis-used. &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/1/1"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; has done in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pamphlet has a handy table contrasting the symptoms of CAD, migraine, tension headache and neck pain. CAD is characterized not by head or neck pain, but by dizziness, double vision, difficulty swallowing, speaking or walking, intense nausea or vomiting, numbness and confusion. We have no way of knowing whether the patients in the Cassidy study had these symptoms or had CAD when they sought treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If CAD was already present, but the patient only had head or neck pain without these neurologic symptoms, there would be no reason to suspect CAD and neither the patient nor the chiropractor would see any contraindication to neck manipulation. Manipulation could be expected to produce further tearing, bleeding, and completed stroke, and might well kill the patient. In the absence of neurologic symptoms, there is no reliable way to predict which patients are at risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the usual neurologic symptoms of CAD were present, any health care provider should have been able to recognize the warning signs of an emergency and send the patient directly to a hospital rather than trying any outpatient treatments. Neck manipulation is clearly contraindicated in these cases. It is good to educate patients, but I don’t see any need for this campaign to “educate practitioners.” If there are chiropractors or MDs out there who can’t already recognize the warning signs of stroke, they should lose their licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the patients who present for care with no symptoms of CAD and without even complaining of head or neck pain? Stroke victims are clearly NOT just patients who went to a chiropractor with head or neck pain. Some were being treated for things like low back pain or shoulder pain. Some patients like Sandra Nette had no pain at all: she had a catastrophic stroke after neck manipulation done simply for health maintenance purposes. Laurie Jean Mathiason, a 20 year old woman, received 186 manipulations of her neck over a 6 month period when her original complaint was lower back pain. The 186th one killed her. 186 treatments in 6 months? I can’t help but ask: how many treatments does it take before you realize that they aren’t working?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pamphlet resorts to the fallacious “death by medicine” tu quoque argument, saying that the risk associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is much greater than the risk of injury from neck adjustments. At least there is evidence that NSAIDs relieve pain; there is no evidence that neck adjustments relieve low back pain, shoulder pain or pain elsewhere in the body that is commonly treated with neck adjustments. There is no evidence that neck adjustments maintain health. There is evidence that neck adjustments relieve certain types of neck and head pain, but there is no evidence that the presumably more dangerous rapid thrusts are any more effective than gentle mobilization methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their own arguments undermine their position. The pamphlet says the risk of stroke with neck adjustments is estimated at anywhere from one in 4 million to one in 400,000, and it also says “ANY risk of injury is too big” - so isn’t that a reason to avoid neck adjustment entirely? And it says providers should choose “the treatment that is likely to provide the greatest benefit compared to risk.” Since chiropractic has not given us any evidence that rapid thrust neck adjustments offer any significant benefit, doesn’t that rule them out as a viable option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They list all the other factors that have been associated with CAD, such as hanging out the laundry, sitting in a barber’s chair, turning the neck while driving, Tai Chi, watching aircraft… anything that extends and rotates the neck. The unspoken implication is that the stroke would have happened anyway even if the patient hadn’t seen a chiropractor, and that chiropractic manipulation is no more traumatic than watching airplanes. That’s clearly wrong, because more force is exerted when a chiropractor rapidly twists a relaxed neck than when someone extends his own neck to look at the sky. When someone turns his neck himself, his muscles actively stabilize the neck and protect it from injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If chiropractors really wanted to understand the risks and minimize them, here’s what they could do. They could establish a database of every patient who received neck manipulations, listing their presenting symptoms, specifying exactly which type of neck manipulations were done, and following each patient up with phone calls to determine whether symptoms of stroke had developed after treatment. That would (1) establish the true incidence of stroke following neck adjustments, (2) determine whether strokes were more common with certain specific types of adjustments, and (3) determine whether patients were seeking “inappropriate” care for pre-existing symptoms of CAD. This could be done at little expense and would answer clinically significant questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This FCER public information campaign is a disgrace. It misinterprets the Cassidy study and it fails to address the real issues. It’s marketing, not public service. And it’s not science. If chiropractors really want to reduce the risk of stroke, this is not the way to go about it. I can only echo Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh, “Pathetic,” he said. “That’s what it is. Pathetic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum: Coincidentally, just as I was writing this I received this e-mail anecdote from a reader: “I had been physically assaulted several days earlier and just wanted to be looked over. I wasn’t in any pain, no physical problems whatsoever, just a cut on my head… The chiropractor twisted my neck really hard, and for a whole year now I’ve been having neck pains on a daily basis.” Not a stroke, but an example of a patient who had NO symptoms before neck adjustment and who had them afterward. Whether or not you believe the treatment caused his chronic neck pain, it is clear that there was NO indication for neck manipulation in this patient. Even if the risk is less than one in 4 million, what benefit would have justified the risk for this patient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fatuity of the Jeni Barnett woman’s manner - her blend of self-righteousness and stupidity, her simply quite staggering inability to grasp, pursue or appreciate a sequence of logical steps - all these are signature characteristics of Britain these days. The lamentable truth is that most of the population wouldn’t really understand why we get so angry at this assault on reason, logic and sense. But we have to keep hammering away at these people and their superstitious inanities. We have to. Well done you and well done all you supporting. I’ve tweeted this site to my followers. I hope they all do their best to support you. Publish and be damned. We’ll fight them and fight them and fight them in the name of empricism, reason, double blind random testing and all that matter.&lt;br&gt;

But Switzerland’s getting it worst of all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland has been affected by measles outbreaks more than other European countries in recent years because of the relatively low level of vaccinations and the presence of educational and religious communities that decline vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak described here indicates that anthroposophic communities are an at-risk group, because many parents in these groups choose not to vaccinate their children with the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine. Anthroposophy, based on the writings of the social philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), combines human development with an investigation of the divine spark found in all of nature. Anthroposophical doctors emphasize nature-based therapies that support the body’s innate healing wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Jenny McCarthy and her cohorts must be stopped!&lt;/p&gt;

Well, it’s partly because I followed the many claims of the global warming “skeptics,” and although their arguments had been debunked numerous times by experts (for example, read RealClimate’s &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/index/"&gt;Responses to common contrarian arguments&lt;/a&gt;), the so-called skeptics kept repeating the already debunked arguments.  After a while you just start thinking, “but that’s been explained already,” and stop taking those people seriously.  So that would be my initial reason.  But the other main reason would have been the thousands of articles published every year in peer reviewed scientific journals, virtually all of them supporting the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) hypothesis.  And it’s also because of the denier tactics employed by the “skeptics”. (More on this later.) Nova writes back that this is argument from authority, and that it’s intellectually lazy to argue this way. Well, I disagree. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Argument From Authority&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It isn’t necessarily fallacious to consider that thousands of climate scientists writing in peer reviewed journals might know more than you do about such a complex subject. Of course, this one is a little tricky for newbies, and I’m sure I got it wrong myself initially. Nizkor is one of the many sites that &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/appeal-to-authority.html"&gt;tries to explain it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…a person who is a legitimate expert is more likely to be right than wrong when making considered claims within her area of expertise. In a sense, the claim is being accepted because it is reasonable to believe that the expert has tested the claim and found it to be reliable. So, if the expert has found it to be reliable, then it is reasonable to accept it as being true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we have here is &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; in the scientific method. And we trust it because we have reason to believe it works – just look around you. (You’re reading this on a computer aren’t you?) And on a blog that promotes science and the scientific method, I’d have to be pretty perverse, or have a very good reason, to oppose thousands of peer reviewed scientific papers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that what we should have is &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; in science. This is not the same as &lt;em&gt;faith&lt;/em&gt;, which is what Nova claimed I have. Faith is belief without evidence, while trust is acceptance of something based on what we have experienced before – ie what has worked and what has been right. In other words, trust of the scientific method is based on evidence that it works.  Claiming that trust and faith are the same thing is the fallacy of &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2006/06/equivocation.html"&gt;equivocation&lt;/a&gt; that I have written about before. The fallacy is to use the same word in different meanings in an argument, implying that the word means the same each time.  Implying that trust is the same as faith is actually the classic example I gave two years ago to explain the fallacy.  Hilariously, Nova responded to this point with dictionary definitions of trust, that I think were supposed to show that trust can be defined in the same way as faith. But duh, that’s the point. They can be defined in the same way. But they can also be defined differently.  And employing these ambiguous definitions s how they can be used to make a fallacious argument. Just because a dictionary gives definitions of the two words, and some of the definitions are similar, that doesn’t mean that trust in the scientific method is the same as faith. Nova even debunked her own point by writing &lt;em&gt;“Planes don&amp;#39;t fly on &amp;quot;trust&amp;quot;. They fly on physics.”&lt;/em&gt; Yes.  But I don’t need to understand the physics to get on a plane. I get on a plane because I trust that planes fly – and that trust is based on what we see in the real world (all those planes in the sky) not on faith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, trusting experts isn’t the same as Michael Egnor listing dead philosophers and scientists who he claims agreed with his views on Dualism.  Science has moved on since the days of Galileo and Newton, and who knows what they might think now?  It also isn’t the same as a certain commenter we all remember suggesting that since he studied plant breeding 30 years ago, his arguments on genetic engineering must be correct and everyone else’s wrong now.  Those were fallacious appeals to authority because the people quoted were not necessarily experts.  That would be the actual argument from authority fallacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not intellectually lazy either to accept the majority peer reviewed science on a topic in which I’m not an expert.  I don’t have any obligation to research and become an expert on every subject under the sun to determine whether to accept or reject a claim; I’ll study in detail only the subjects I feel an interest or a need to study, and no more.  So sometimes I will rely on experts.  Of course, relying on experts is weaker than understanding the evidence in detail, no one would deny that.  And this would be a problem if I were writing a blog on global warming, or even writing posts on the details of global warming.  But I’m not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nova replies that in that case, I shouldn’t refer to the AGW “Skeptics” as “deniers.”  Again, I disagree.  I refer to them as deniers because they also rely on denier &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Denier Tactics&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I said, one reason I gave up with the global warming (so called) skeptics, was because of the denier tactics they clearly relied on.  Here I think it would be useful to refer to Denialism Blog and their explanation of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/about.php"&gt;What is Denialism&lt;/a&gt;, because why reinvent the wheel?  They talk about five general tactics used by denialists, namely:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Conspiracy &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Selectivity (cherry-picking) &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Fake experts &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Impossible expectations (also known as moving goalposts) &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;General fallacies of logic. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;I would add a sixth, namely continuing to repeat arguments long after they have been debunked.  Climate denialists like Nova rely on many of these techniques, as I will show using this email exchange and her own web page.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Selectivity (Cherry Picking)&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denialism Blog explains &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/05/selectivity_cherry_picking_1.php"&gt;Selectivity (Cherry Picking)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denialists tend to cite single papers supporting their idea&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bingo.  Nova claimed AGW had been “falsified” by David Evans’s &lt;a href="http://www.sciencespeak.com/MissingSignature.pdf"&gt;The Missing Greenhouse Signature&lt;/a&gt; paper (which is not a peer reviewed paper as far as I can tell, despite what Nova claimed).  This paper starts with: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each possible cause of global warming has a different pattern of where in the planet the warming occurs first and the most. The signature of an increased greenhouse effect is a hotspot about 10 km up in the atmosphere over the tropics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read the second sentence in that piece again.  It’s presented as a fact that, if falsified, falsifies the whole of AGW.  The problem is, as far as I can tell, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/wiki/index.php?title=David_Evans"&gt;it’s not true&lt;/a&gt;.  For example, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2008/07/the_australians_war_on_science_16.php"&gt;Tim Lambert writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This couldn&amp;#39;t be more wrong. Study the graphs below (from RealClimate). The left one shows the pattern predicted for doubling CO2, while the right one shows the pattern for a 2% increase in solar output.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both patterns include a hot spot. The difference between the two graphs is that the CO2 one shows cooling in the stratosphere, while the right one does not, so the &amp;quot;greenhouse signature&amp;quot; is stratospheric cooling. And guess what, &lt;a href="http://www.atmosphere.mpg.de/enid/20c.html"&gt;that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s been happening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then there is Chris Colose at &lt;a href="http://chriscolose.wordpress.com/2008/12/20/skepticsdenialists-part-2-hotspots-and-repetition/"&gt;Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tropospheric warming in the tropics is a signature of greenhouse warming, but it is more accurate to say that it is not a unique signature (i.e., you get this “hotspot” with all types of forcings).    &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And :&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on many recent papers, such as &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2007GL029875.shtml"&gt;Tropical vertical temperature trends: A real discrepancy? by Thorne et al&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://earth.geology.yale.edu/%7Esherwood/sondeanal.pdf"&gt;Robust tropospheric warming revealed by iteratively homogenized radiosonde data, by Sherwood et al&lt;/a&gt;, and the recent &lt;a href="https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2008/NR-08-10-05-article.pdf"&gt;Santer et al.&lt;/a&gt; paper, it is not obvious a real model-observation discrepancy exists, so to ignore these papers and the uncertainty in the data is not going to get Evans very far. Realclimate has a much more thorough discussion of those, and more papers on this topic &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/12/tropical-troposphere-trends/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/tropical-tropopshere-ii/"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/10/tropical-tropopshere-iii/langswitch_lang/im"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It looks to me as though experts disagree with Evans.  Certainly few if any of them take seriously this unpublished and non peer reviewed essay.  Of course, experts can be wrong, but clearly this paper does not “falsify” AGW as Nova claimed.  The point is, Nova citing this paper as &lt;em&gt;“showing that the theory has been falsified”&lt;/em&gt; is as clear an example of cherry picking as it is possible to make.  The idea that the whole of AGW – thousands of peer reviewed scientific papers and evidence – is falsified by this one article on a web site, is just absurd.  And a standard denialist / crank tactic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Fake Experts &lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Denialism Blog’s section on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/05/fake_experts.php"&gt;Fake Experts&lt;/a&gt;, they state that:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[real] experts have experience in their field, and they can provide answers that are consistent with the state of knowledge in that field&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…a fake expert is usually somebody who is relied upon for their credentials rather than any real experience in the field at issue, who will promote arguments that are inconsistent with the literature, aren&amp;#39;t generally accepted by those who study the field in question, and/or whose theories aren&amp;#39;t consistent with established epistemological requirements for scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So who does Nova write about excitedly on her blog?  &lt;a href="http://joannenova.com.au/2009/01/28/the-turning-point%E2%80%94its-becoming-chic-to-be-a-skeptic/"&gt;John Theon&lt;/a&gt;, who was supposedly James Hansen’s supervisor at NASA but who now disagrees that global warming is man made.  Of course we know that &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/01/warm-reception-to-antarctic-warming-story/#comment-110819"&gt;Theon wasn’t actually Hansen’s “boss”,&lt;/a&gt; and that he &lt;a href="http://bigcitylib.blogspot.com/2009/01/john-s-theon-new-elderly-denier-on.html"&gt;retired from NASA in 1994&lt;/a&gt;.  Theon seems like the archetypal fake expert – someone with credentials but who hasn’t worked in the field for a long while – too long to be taken seriously over current experts to be sure.  Nova adopts standard denialist tactics by writing about this as though it is meaningful, just as she also appeals to &lt;a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Files.View&amp;amp;FileStore_id=83947f5d-d84a-4a84-ad5d-6e2d71db52d9"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; of 650 supposed experts who dispute AGW, although we know this list is padded with TV weathermen, economists, non-climate experts, and a number who are actually not AGW “skeptics” anyway.  In fact &lt;a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/DutchS/PSEUDOSC/650Skeptics.HTM"&gt;58% of the &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; quoted have no credentials in climate research and only 16% have top-notch credentials&lt;/a&gt;.  Also see &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/2008/12/11/inhofe-morano-recycles-long-debunked-denier-talking-points-will-the-media-be-fooled-again/"&gt;another debunking&lt;/a&gt; of this list.  Compare these 650 (really less than 100) &amp;quot;skeptics&amp;quot; with the &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/about/"&gt;American Geophysical Union&lt;/a&gt; (AGU) which has 50,000 members, most of whom really are earth scientists.  Only a few dozen AGU members are on this latest denier list.  Again, standard denier techniques from Nova.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Impossible Expectations and Moving Goalposts&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denialism Blog defines &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/05/impossible_expectations_and_mo.php"&gt;Impossible expectations (and moving goalposts)&lt;/a&gt; as “the use, by denialists, of the absence of complete and absolute knowledge of a subject to prevent implementation of sound policies, or acceptance of an idea or a theory.”  And guess what, the example they give is of global warming deniers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;One finds that they harp endlessly about models, how much models suck, how you can&amp;#39;t model anything, on and on and on. True, models are hard, anything designed to prognosticate such a large set of variables as those involved in climate is going to be highly complex, and I&amp;#39;ll admit, I don&amp;#39;t understand them worth a damn. Climate science in general is beyond me, and I read the papers in Science and Nature that come out, blink a few times, and then read the editors description to see why I should care. But with or without models, which I do trust the scientists and peer-reviewers involved to test adequately, that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that actual measurement of global mean temperature is possible, and is showing an alarmingly steep increase post-industrialization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t need to add much to that, except to state that (unsurprisingly) Nova doesn’t believe climate models are empirical evidence.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add the list of debunked AGW skeptic arguments that the AGW “skeptics” keep repeating, and you have quite a litany of denialism.  Cherry picking one non peer reviewed and unpublished paper that few if any climate scientists take seriously and claiming in all seriousness that it falsifies the whole of AGW.  Reporting on lists of “skeptics” as though this actually means anything.  Claiming models aren’t science.  Calling logical fallacies that aren’t while relying on them herself.  After this exchange I’m even more convinced of the science behind AGW.  I describe the AGW skeptics as deniers because they employ denier &lt;em&gt;tactics&lt;/em&gt;.  Employ denier tactics, you’re a denier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Evidence for AGW&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nova claims there is none.  For those interested, here is some.  The links are not direct to peer reviewed papers (although there are links in some of the articles to peer reviewed work).  Obviously it’s not comprehensive.  But it’s a good place to start and you certainly can’t claim there is “none.”  Unless you’re a denier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/start-here/"&gt;RealClimate&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start.  Also see their site &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/index/"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coby on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2006/03/models-are-unproven.php"&gt;The Models are Unproven&lt;/a&gt; which includes a list of significant predictions of enhanced greenhouse gas warming that have been made and confirmed.   Also &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2008/07/how_to_talk_to_a_sceptic.php"&gt;How to Talk to a Climate Sceptic&lt;/a&gt; which also explains denier tactics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-syr.htm"&gt;IPCC Fourth Assessment Report&lt;/a&gt;.  Note: the IPCC collates research published by scientists and institutions across the world – that’s thousands of peer reviewed climate science &lt;em&gt;papers&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change"&gt;Scientific opinion on climate change&lt;/a&gt; – an article that documents scientific opinion as given by synthesis reports, scientific bodies of national or international standing, and surveys of opinion among climate scientists.  Agreed it’s a Wikipedia page, but there are 90 links to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

We know the cause: a drought that dried tons of brush to tinder, lightning strikes, and deplorably, apparently a number of arsonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that's what I would say were the causes. But then, I'm one of those materialists. Danny Nalliah, pastor of one of those cheesy evangelical organizations, &lt;a href="http://catchthefire.com.au/blog/2009/02/10/media-release-abortion-laws-to-blame-for-bush-fires/"&gt;has a different idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CTFM leader, Pastor Danny Nalliah said he would spearhead an effort to provide every assistance to devastated communities, although he was not surprised by the bush fires due to a dream he had last October relating to consequences of the abortion laws passed in Victoria.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He said these bushfires have come as a result of the incendiary abortion laws which decimate life in the womb. Besides providing material assistance, CTFM will commence a seven day prayer and fasting campaign for the nation of Australia tomorrow Wednesday the 11th February.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
CTFM has called upon all Australian Bible-believing God-fearing Christians to repent and call upon the Lord Jesus Christ for His mercy and protection over Australia once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a simple word for people like Danny Nalliah:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ghoul.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sees a catastrophe, pain, and loss of life as an opportunity to proselytize for his idiotic religion. His faith is a parasite that feeds on death and destruction and fear. That's all he's got. This is just more of the same from this wretched ghoul: before the fires, &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/pastors-abortion-dream-inflames-bushfire-tragedy-20090210-832f.html"&gt;he was making similar accusations of blame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had previously said drought and the world financial crisis could be partly blamed on human sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people are useless lunatics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/australias_current_afflictions.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/c4prdtdqgIo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234241319982"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/lets_meet_in_new_york_city_nex.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e64d7329cdfe3a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Practice"/><title type="html">Let's meet in New York City next week</title><published>2009-02-10T03:09:01Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T03:09:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/JigTGpGLRaY/lets_meet_in_new_york_city_nex.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/lets_meet_in_new_york_city_nex.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I will be on a panel, &lt;a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/news/exhibitions/2009/2009-02-03.scholarly_comm.html" title=""&gt;Open Science: Good For Research, Good For Researchers?&lt;/a&gt; next week, February 19th (3:00 to 5:00 pm EST at Columbia University, Morningside Campus, Shapiro CEPSR Building, Davis Auditorium). I am sure my hosts will organize something for us that day before and/or after the event, but Mrs.Coturnix and I will be there a couple of days longer. So, I think we should have a meetup - for Overlords, SciBlings, Nature Networkers, independent bloggers, readers and fans ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Friday evening a good time for this?  Or is Saturday better? Let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can follow the panel on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ScholarlyComm" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/event.php?eid=52588835843" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (I am not sure, but the panel may be recorded in some way and subsequently made available online - will check on that), or, if you can, show up in person. More information can be found &lt;a href="http://scholcomm.columbia.edu/open-science-good-research-good-researchers" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Open science refers to information-sharing among researchers, and encompasses a number of initiatives to remove access barriers to data and published papers and to use digital technology to more efficiently disseminate research results. Advocates for this approach argue that openly sharing information among researchers is fundamental to good science, speeds the progress of research, and increases recognition of researchers. The panel will discuss frequently raised questions such as "Can open science practices work for researchers who need to establish priority of publication to advance their careers?" and "Is open science compatible with peer review?"&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/lets_meet_in_new_york_city_nex.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/JigTGpGLRaY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234241319982"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_121.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/760c9d7894bdbee3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-02-10T02:58:08Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T02:58:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/6o1p2hz422E/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_121.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_121.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=2&amp;amp;day=9&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;15 new articles&lt;/a&gt; published Friday night and &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=2&amp;amp;day=10&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;15 new articles&lt;/a&gt; published tonight in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004400" title=""&gt;Impact of Climate Change on the Relict Tropical Fish Fauna of Central Sahara: Threat for the Survival of Adrar Mountains Fishes, Mauritania&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Four central Sahara mountainous massifs provide habitats for relict populations of fish. In the Adrar of Mauritania all available data on the presence and distribution of fish come from pre-1960 surveys where five fish species were reported: Barbus pobeguini, Barbus macrops, Barbus mirei, Sarotherodon galilaeus, and Clarias anguillaris. Since 1970, drought has had a severe impact in the Adrar where rainfall decreased by 35%. To investigate whether the relict populations of fish have survived the continuing drought, a study was carried out from 2004 to 2008. An inventory of perennial bodies of water was drawn up using a literature review and analysis of topographical and hydrological maps. Field surveys were carried out in order to locate the bodies of water described in the literature, identify the presence of fish, determine which species were present and estimate their abundance. The thirteen sites where the presence of fish was observed in the 1950s -Ksar Torchane, Ilij, Molomhar, Agueni, Tachot, Hamdoun, Terjit, Toungad, El Berbera, Timagazine, Dâyet el Mbârek, Dâyet et-Tefla, Nkedeï- were located and surveyed. The Ksar Torchane spring -type locality and the only known locality of B. mirei- has dried up at the height of the drought in 1984, and any fish populations have since become extinct there. The Timagazine, Dâyet el Mbârek and Dâyet et-Tefla pools have become ephemeral. The Hamdoun guelta appears to be highly endangered. The fish populations at the other sites remain unchanged. Four perennial pools which are home to populations of B. pobeguini are newly recorded. The tropical relict fish populations of the Adrar mountains of Mauritania appear to be highly endangered. Of thirteen previously recorded populations, four have become extinct since the beginning of the drought period. New fish population extinctions may occur should low levels of annual rainfall be repeated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004360" title=""&gt;Social Distance Evaluation in Human Parietal Cortex&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Across cultures, social relationships are often thought of, described, and acted out in terms of physical space (e.g. "close friends" "high lord"). Does this cognitive mapping of social concepts arise from shared brain resources for processing social and physical relationships? Using fMRI, we found that the tasks of evaluating social compatibility and of evaluating physical distances engage a common brain substrate in the parietal cortex. The present study shows the possibility of an analytic brain mechanism to process and represent complex networks of social relationships. Given parietal cortex's known role in constructing egocentric maps of physical space, our present findings may help to explain the linguistic, psychological and behavioural links between social and physical space.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004377" title=""&gt;Metabolic and Behavioral Compensations in Response to Caloric Restriction: Implications for the Maintenance of Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Metabolic and behavioral adaptations to caloric restriction (CR) in free-living conditions have not yet been objectively measured. Forty-eight (36.8±1.0 y), overweight (BMI 27.8±0.7 kg/m2) participants were randomized to four groups for 6-months; Control: energy intake at 100% of energy requirements; CR: 25% calorie restriction; CR+EX: 12.5% CR plus 12.5% increase in energy expenditure by structured exercise; LCD: low calorie diet (890 kcal/d) until 15% weight reduction followed by weight maintenance. Body composition (DXA) and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) over 14-days by doubly labeled water (DLW) and activity related energy activity (AREE) were measured after 3 (M3) and 6 (M6) months of intervention. Weight changes at M6 were −1.0±1.1% (Control), −10.4±0.9% (CR), −10.0±0.8% (CR+EX) and −13.9±0.8% (LCD). At M3, absolute TDEE was significantly reduced in CR (−454±76 kcal/d) and LCD (−633±66 kcal/d) but not in CR+EX or controls. At M6 the reduction in TDEE remained lower than baseline in CR (−316±118 kcal/d) and LCD (−389±124 kcal/d) but reached significance only when CR and LCD were combined (−351±83 kcal/d). In response to caloric restriction (CR/LCD combined), TDEE adjusted for body composition, was significantly lower by −431±51 and −240±83 kcal/d at M3 and M6, respectively, indicating a metabolic adaptation. Likewise, physical activity (TDEE adjusted for sleeping metabolic rate) was significantly reduced from baseline at both time points. For control and CR+EX, adjusted TDEE (body composition or sleeping metabolic rate) was not changed at either M3 or M6. For the first time we show that in free-living conditions, CR results in a metabolic adaptation and a behavioral adaptation with decreased physical activity levels. These data also suggest potential mechanisms by which CR causes large inter-individual variability in the rates of weight loss and how exercise may influence weight loss and weight loss maintenance.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_121.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/6o1p2hz422E" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234241202299"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-20494433.post-1332569550405491588">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4813322cf042265a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="navel-gazing" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Books" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rhetoric" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Literature" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Election '08" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Communication" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">On Interpretation</title><published>2009-02-10T04:17:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T04:44:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2009/02/on-interpretation.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/1332569550405491588/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=20494433&amp;postID=1332569550405491588" title="10 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SZEF7aSgHMI/AAAAAAAAA68/8kT_39OgFKk/s1600-h/ror1.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:320px;height:216px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_kYu2r3RVPhY/SZEF7aSgHMI/AAAAAAAAA68/8kT_39OgFKk/s320/ror1.JPG" border="0" title="I see an old lady!--No, wait, a young girl!--No, I mean, two faces eating a candlestick!" alt="I see an old lady!--No, wait, a young girl!--No, I mean, two faces eating a candlestick!" hspace="5" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I thought I'd talked about this before on the blog, but apparently I've managed to go this long without really tackling the issue of interpretation. Consequently, you might notice some of the themes and points in this post getting repeated in my next big article, since writing that was what alerted me to my omission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't generally like absolute statements, since they so rarely are, but I think this one works: &lt;b&gt;there is no reading without interpretation&lt;/b&gt;. In fact, I could go a step further and say there's no &lt;i&gt;communication&lt;/i&gt; without interpretation, but reading is the most obvious and pertinent example. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each person is different, the product of a unique set of circumstances, experiences, knowledge, and so forth. Consequently, each person approaches each and every text with different baggage, and a different framework. When they read the text, it gets filtered through and informed by those experiences, that knowledge, and that framework. This process influences the way the reader understands the text. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gah, that's way too general. Let's try this again: I saw the first couple of Harry Potter movies before I started reading the books; consequently, I came to the books with the knowledge of the movie cast, and I interpreted the books through that framework--not intentionally, mind you, it's just that the images the text produced in my mind included Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape. However, I plowed through the series faster than the moviemakers have. The descriptions in the books (and the illustrations) informed my mental images of other characters, so when I saw "Order of the Phoenix," I found the casting decision for Dolores Umbridge quite at odds with my interpretation of the character, who was less frou-frou and more frog-frog. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've all faced this kind of thing: our prior experiences inform our future interpretations. I imagine most people picking up an Ian Fleming novel have a particular Bond playing the role in their mental movies. There was quite a bit of tizzy over the character designs in "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" movie, from Marvin's stature and shape to the odd placement of Zaphod's second head, to Ford Prefect's skin color. I hear &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175834/"&gt;Kevin Conroy&lt;/a&gt;'s voice when I read Batman dialogue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This process is a subset of the larger linguistic process of accumulating connotation. As &lt;a href="http://ferretcage.blogspot.com/2008/11/defintions-and-connotations-why-we-need.html"&gt;King of Ferrets&lt;/a&gt; fairly recently noted, words are more than just their definitions; they gather additional meaning through the accumulation of connotations--auxiliary meaning attached to the world through the forces of history and experience. Often, these connotations are widespread. For example, check out how the word "Socialist" got thrown around during the election. There's nothing in the definition of the word that makes it the damning insult it's supposed to be, but thanks to the Cold War and the USSR, people interpret the word to mean more than just "someone who believes in collective ownership of the means of production." Nothing about "natural" means "good and healthy," yet that's how it's perceived; nothing about "atheist" means "immoral and selfish," nor does it mean "rational and scientific," but depending on who you say it around, it may carry either of those auxiliary meanings. Words are, when it comes right down to it, symbols of whatever objects or concepts they represent, and like any symbols (crosses, six-pointed stars, bright red 'A's, Confederate flags, swastikas, etc.), they take on meanings in the minds of the people beyond what they were intended to represent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This process isn't just a social one; it happens on a personal level, too. We all attach some connotations and additional meanings to words and other symbols based on our own personal experiences. I'm sure we all have this on some level; we've all had a private little chuckle when some otherwise innocuous word or phrase reminds us of some inside joke--and we've also all had that sinking feeling as we've tried to explain the joke to someone who isn't familiar with our private connotations. I know one group of people who would likely snicker if I said "gravy pipe," while others would just scratch their heads; I know another group of people who would find the phrase "I've got a boat" &lt;i&gt;hilarious&lt;/i&gt;, but everyone else is going to be lost. I could explain, but even if you understood, you wouldn't find it funny, and you almost certainly wouldn't be reminded of my story next time you heard the word "gravy." Words like "doppelganger" and "ubiquitous" are funny to me because of the significance I've attached to them through the personal process of connotation-building. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this is where it's kind of key to be aware of your audience. If you're going to communicate effectively with your audience, you need to have some understanding of this process. In order to communicate effectively, I need to recognize that not everyone will burst into laughter if I say "mass media" or "ice dragon," because not everyone shares the significance that I've privately attached to those phrases. Communication is only effective where the speaker and listener share a common language; this simple fact requires the speaker to know what connotations he and his audience are likely to share. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately or unfortunately, we're not telepathic. What this means is that we cannot know with certainty how any given audience will interpret what we say. We might guess to a high degree of accuracy, depending on how well we know our audience, but there's &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; going to be some uncertainty involved. That ambiguity of meaning is present in nearly every word, no matter how simple, no matter how apparently direct, because of the way we naturally attach and interpret meaning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the example I generally like to use: take the word "DOG." It's a very simple word with a fairly straightforward definition, yet it's going to be interpreted slightly differently by everyone who reads or hears it. I imagine that everyone, reading the word, has formed a particular picture in their heads of some particular dog from their own experience. Some people are associating the word with smells, sounds, feelings, other words, sensations, and events in their lives. Some small number of people might be thinking of a certain TV bounty hunter. The point is that the word, while defined specifically, includes a large amount of ambiguity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's constrain the ambiguity, then. Take the phrase "BLACK DOG." Now, I've closed off some possibilities: people's mental pictures are no longer of golden retrievers and dalmatians. I've closed off some possibilities that the term "DOG" leaves open, moving to the included subset of black dogs. There's still ambiguity, though: is it a little basket-dwelling dog like Toto, or a big German Shepherd? Long hair or short hair? What kind of collar? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there's an added wrinkle here. When I put the word "BLACK" in there, I brought in the ambiguity associated with &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; word as well. Is the dog all black, or mostly black with some other colors, like a doberman? What shade of black are we talking about? Is it matte or glossy? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's further ambiguity arising from the specific word combination. When I say "BLACK DOG," I may mean a dark-colored canine, or I may mean that "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dog_(song)"&gt;I gotta roll, can't stand still, got a flamin' heart, can't get my fill&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that's just connotational ambiguity; there's definitional ambiguity as well. The word "period" is a great example of this. Definitionally, it means something very different to a geologist, an astronomer, a physicist, a historian, a geneticist, a chemist, a musician, an editor, a hockey player, and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_You_There_God%3F_It&amp;#39;s_Me,_Margaret"&gt;Margaret Simon&lt;/a&gt;. Connotationally, it's going to mean something very different to ten-year-old Margaret Simon lagging behind her classmates and 25-year-old Margaret Simon on the first day of her Hawaiian honeymoon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People, I think, are aware of these ambiguities on some level; the vast majority of verbal humor relies on them to some degree. Our language has built-in mechanisms to alleviate it. In speaking, we augment the words with gestures, inflections, and expressions. If I say "BLACK DOG" while pointing at a black dog, or at the radio playing a distinctive guitar riff, my meaning is more clear. The tone of my voice as I say "BLACK DOG" will likely give some indication as to my general (or specific) feelings about black dogs, or that black dog in particular. Writing lacks these abilities, but punctuation, capitalization, and font modification (such as bold and italics) are able to accomplish some of the same goals, and other ones besides. Whether I'm talking about the canine or the song would be immediately apparent in print, as the difference between "black dog" and "'Black Dog.'" In both venues, one of the most common ways to combat linguistic ambiguity is to &lt;i&gt;add more words&lt;/i&gt;. Whether it's writing "black dog, a Labrador Retriever, with floppy ears and a cold nose and the nicest temperament..." or saying "black dog, that black dog, the one over there by the flagpole..." we use words (generally in conjunction with the other tools of the communication medium) to clarify other words. None of these methods, however, can completely eliminate the ambiguity in communication, and they all have the potential to add further ambiguity to the communication by adding information as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To kind of summarize all that in a slightly more entertaining way, look at the phrase "JANE LOVES DICK." It might be a sincere assessment of Jane's affection for Richard, or it might be a crude explanation of Jane's affinity for male genitals. Or, depending on how you define terms, it might be both. Textually, we can change it to "Jane loves Dick" or "Jane loves dick," and that largely clarifies the point. Verbally, we'd probably use wildly different gestures and inflections to talk about Jane's office crush and her organ preference. And in either case, we can say something like "Jane--Jane Sniegowski, from Accounting--loves Dick Travers, the executive assistant. Mostly, she loves his dick." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The net result of all this is that in any communication, there is some loss of information, of specificity, between the speaker and the listener (or the writer and the reader). I have some specific interpretation of the ideas I want to communicate, I approximate that with words (and often the approximation is very close), and my audience interprets those words through their own individual framework. Hopefully, the resulting idea in my audience's mind bears a close resemblance to the idea in mine; the closer they are, the more effective the communication. But perfect communication--loss-free transmission of ideas from one mind to another--is impossible given how language and our brains work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't really think any of this is controversial; in fact, I think it's generally pretty obvious. Any good writer or speaker knows to anticipate their audience's reactions and interpretations, specifically because what the audience hears might be wildly different from what the communicator says (or is trying to say). Part of why I've been perhaps overly explanatory and meticulous in this post is that I know talking about language can get very quickly confusing, and I'm hoping to make my points particularly clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's one other wrinkle here, which is a function of the timeless nature of things like written communication. What I'm writing here in the Midwestern United States in the early 21st Century might look as foreign to the readers of the 25th as the works of Shakespeare look to us. I can feel fairly confident that my current audience--especially the people who I know well who read this blog--will understand what I've said here, but I have no way of accurately anticipating the interpretive frameworks of future audiences. I can imagine the word "dick" losing its bawdy definition sometime in the next fifty years, so it'll end up with a little definition footnote when this gets printed in the Norton Anthology of Blogging Literature. Meanwhile, "ambiguity" will take on an ancillary definition referring to the sex organs of virtual prostitutes, so those same students will be snickering throughout this passage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't know what words will lose their current definitions and take on other meanings or fall out of language entirely, so I can't knowledgeably write for that audience. If those future audiences are to understand what I'm trying to communicate, then they're going to have to read my writing in the context of my current definitions, connotations, idioms, and culture. Of course, even footnotes can only take you so far--in many cases, it's going to be like reading an in-joke that's been explained to you; you'll kind of get the idea, but not the impact. The greater the difference between the culture of the communicator and the culture of the audience, the more difficulty the audience will have in accurately and completely interpreting the communicator's ideas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great problems can arise when we forget about all these factors that go into communication and interpretation. We might mistakenly assume that everyone is familiar with the idioms we use, and thus open ourselves up to criticism (e.g., "lipstick on a pig" in the 2008 election); we might mistakenly assume that no one else is familiar with the terms we use, and again open ourselves up to criticism (e.g., "macaca" in the 2006 election). We might misjudge our audience's knowledge and either baffle or condescend to them. We might forget the individuality of interpretation and presume that all audience members interpret things the same way, or that our interpretation is precisely what the speaker meant and all others have missed the point. We would all do well to remember that communication is a &lt;i&gt;complicated&lt;/i&gt; thing, and that those complexities do have real-world consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-1332569550405491588?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234240839638"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-8630561036569366906">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/24cdad71036bc32b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Google Earth for The Tree of Life</title><published>2009-02-10T03:13:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T03:17:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/google-earth-for-tree-of-life.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=8630561036569366906" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Head over to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/02/09/google-earth-for-the-tree-of-life/"&gt;The Loom&lt;/a&gt; and see Carl Zimmer's &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt; article on &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/science/10tree.html"&gt;Crunching the data for the tree of life&lt;/a&gt;.

This is what I’ve been saying for years. There’s a difference between traffic and profit, and when it comes to business the latter makes a much better scoreboard than the former.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already I’m seeing comments pop up that “this will be the death of the Times”. No, it won’t. Not doing this will, their results over the last couple years have essentially proven that. Selling content online may not save them either, but it may, and if it doesn’t it won’t be what killed them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem in many people’s thinking is the belief that there’s always a magic business model lurking around the corner that will circumvent the normal laws of capitalism just because the internet’s involved. There isn’t. Reducing marginal costs certainly opens up a few doors to businesses, but it doesn’t mean that any product can suddenly be profitably supported by advertising alone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s find a way to do Class A journalism on such a low budget that we can profit off of advertising” might just be equivalent to “Let’s find a way to have an online shoe store where we give the shoes away and make money off of advertising.” It may not be possible, and a lot of the people I know in the tech world really need to open their minds to that. I’m not saying I’m certain for news in particular, though the evidence is certainly pointing in that direction, but there’s some chance that the expense of providing high quality journalism (for which there is always high demand) or video or social networking or whatever else is simply greater than the reward for any business model other than charging customers directly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I’m right and it’s not possible, then what’s going to happen is one by one every free content site that tries to go the quality route (rather than the blog-style breaking news with little or no real insight one) is going to shut down. NYT realizes this, and that their quality comes with a price tag that ensures they’d be among the first. So they’re trying something different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray for us that it works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234237463852"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1397">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/347194b986b2fb91</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Food"/><category term="Humor/ Fun Stuff"/><title type="html">Out of the frying pan</title><published>2009-02-10T03:42:16Z</published><updated>2009-02-10T03:42:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/out-of-the-frying-pan/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">Totally light-weight news here, while I take care of tonnes of paperwork and finish another post:

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been watching a cool show on &lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/"&gt;National Geographic TV&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s called &lt;em&gt;Morphed&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s all about evolution. There are three episodes so far. I’m not sure if it’s going to be a longer series or not, but these three are worth seeing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Whales had Legs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Dinosaur to Turkey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before They were Bears&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/morphed/all/Overview"&gt;&lt;img src="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/staticfiles/NGC/StaticFiles/Series/Morphed/Images/morphed-overview.jpg" alt="" width="532" height="440"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with evolution, there’s probably not much new here. But it’s all explained in an easy-to-understand format with good graphics and animations. And two of the three episodes are about my favorite animals: dinosaurs and whales. All I could think of after watching these is, “Anyone who thinks there are no ‘transitional fossils’ and who doesn’t believe in evolution is clearly wearing blinders.” That’s just how I always felt watching the hippos at the San Diego Zoo, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/morphed/all/Overview"&gt;Check out the website&lt;/a&gt;. There are some great videos and interactive animations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For some reason, collectively humans seem to have a hard time seeing around corners to anticipate the shape our future will take.  Of those of us who remember email as a newish thing, I suspect most of us had no idea how much of our waking lives would come to be consumed by it.  And surely I am not the only one who attended a lab meeting in which a visiting scholar mentioned a speculative project to build something called the World Wide Web and wondered aloud whether anything would come of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the realm of foreign conflicts, our shared expectations also seem to land some distance from reality, as missions that are declared "accomplished" (or all but) stretch on with no clear end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Wired for War&lt;/i&gt;, Brookings Institution senior fellow P.W. SInger asks us to try to peer around some important corners to anticipate the future of robotics in our conflicts and in our lives more broadly.

&lt;p&gt;Reports drifting around the internet say she has now &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/jeni-barnett-have-you-lost-something.html"&gt;deleted derogatory comments from her blog&lt;/a&gt;. Also the entire debacle has recently caught the attention of Mr Stephen Fry who twittered about the fuss this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;IMHO this chap needs out support http://tinyurl.com/btokam Vaccination scares are SO bloody irresponsible, espesh this sort. Kids have died.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These comments also from Stephen appear on Ben Goldacre’s Bad Science site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fatuity of the Jeni Barnett woman’s manner - her blend of self-righteousness and stupidity, her simply quite staggering inability to grasp, pursue or appreciate a sequence of logical steps - all these are signature characteristics of Britain these days. The lamentable truth is that most of the population wouldn’t really understand why we get so angry at this assault on reason, logic and sense. But we have to keep hammering away at these people and their superstitious inanities. We have to. Well done you and well done all you supporting. I’ve tweeted this site to my followers. I hope they all do their best to support you. Publish and be damned. We’ll fight them and fight them and fight them in the name of empricism, reason, double blind random testing and all that matters.&lt;br&gt;
Love&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen xxx&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Only about 20% of people with disabilities are currently employed, compared to 65% of people without disabilities.  To get at some of the "whys" of this, &lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/odep/categories/research/index.htm"&gt;Department of Labor research&lt;/a&gt; has released a new report &lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/odep/documents/survey_report_jan_09.doc"&gt;Survey of Employer Perspectives on the Employment of People with Disabilities (MS Word format)&lt;/a&gt;.  From that report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP), conducted the 2008 Survey of Employer Perspectives on the Employment of People with Disabilities. The objective of this nationally representative survey was to inform the development and promotion of policy and practice by comparing employer perspectives across various industries and within companies of varying sizes. ODEP will use the data from this survey to formulate targeted strategies and policies for increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. This survey emphasized current attitudes and practices of employers in 12 industry sectors, including some high growth industries as projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some barriers to hiring employees with disabilities were found to be employer shyness about the ability of workers to do their jobs, worries about the cost of accommodations, and fears about the cost of health care and other benefits for employees.  These perceptions by employers exist beyond mere figures on a report page: Friday ABFH &lt;a href="http://autisticbfh.blogspot.com/2009/02/employers-think-before-you-discriminate.html"&gt;reported in her blog&lt;/a&gt; about a current court case involving a woman who "was illegally terminated based on her employer's perception that she was substantially limited in the major life activities of working and thinking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year in Chicago, &lt;a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/jan/28/business/chi-mon_disability_0128jan28"&gt;a smaller study&lt;/a&gt; asked the question, is there a basis for some of these fears?  Are people with disabilities crappy workers?  Are special accommodations costly and complicated?  Do the costs outweigh the benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the study can't necessarily be generalized beyond what it was, it did find that workers with disabilities had comparable performance records to employees without disabilities, and accommodations were inexpensive (if they cost anything at all).  For employees surveyed, a number of employees without disabilities reported also receiving workplace accommodations (i.e. accommodations are not always all that special, and are simply good for workers in general).  To read the Chicago report: &lt;a href="http://news.change.org/www.disabilityworks.org/downloads/disabilityworksDePaulStudyExecutiveSummary.pdf"&gt;executive summary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://news.change.org/www.disabilityworks.org/downloads/disabilityworksDePaulStudyComprehensiveResults.pdf"&gt;comprehensive results&lt;/a&gt;, both PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will it take to dispel the myths surrounding employees with disabilities?  How will DoL "formulate targeted strategies and policies for increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showing companies how hiring employees with disabilities will affect (or rather really not affect) their "bottom line," like the Chicago study did, is one strategy to use.  It seems to me that no matter what else, a lot of education is clearly needed.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living in the dark ages, for all the superstition and myth that surrounds how the mainstream views people like me.  It's time employers modernized their conception of people with disabilities, methinks!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234224184788"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3013">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/57facb053b62239e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random"/><category term="advice"/><category term="career"/><category term="internships"/><category term="jobs"/><category term="parents"/><title type="html">Dear Parent….</title><published>2009-02-09T22:55:32Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T22:55:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/02/09/dear-parent/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you email me about an internship I’ve posted, and tell me YOU are looking for an internship for your son/daughter, that pretty much puts the kibosh on me ever hiring your kid right there.  (BTW, It’s &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; not helpful if you use the words “lost”, “adrift”, or “confused” to describe your child.)&lt;/p&gt;

Following a meeting of technical experts and the leadership in Chamonix, France last wee, the CERN Directorate has issued a press release with the new plan for LHC restart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CERN Management today confirmed the restart schedule for the Large Hadron Collider resulting from the recommendations from the Chamonix workshop. The new schedule foresees first beams in the LHC at the end of September this year, with collisions following in late October.  A short technical stop has also been foreseen over the Christmas period. The LHC will then run through to autumn next year, ensuring that the experiments have adequate data to carry out their first new physics analyses and have results to announce in 2010. The new schedule also permits the possible collisions of lead ions in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new schedule represents a delay of 6 weeks with respect to the previous schedule which foresaw LHC “cold at the beginning of July”. The cause of this delay is due to several factors such as implementation of a new enhanced protection system for the busbar and magnet splices, installation of new pressure relief valves to reduce the collateral damage in case of a repeat incident, application of more stringent safety constraints, and scheduling constraints associated with helium transfer and storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Chamonix there was consensus among all the technical specialists that the new schedule is tight but realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhanced protection system measures the electrical resistance in the cable joints (splices) and is much more sensitive than the system existing on 19 September.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new pressure relief system has been designed in two phases.  The first phase involves installation of relief valves on existing vacuum ports in the whole ring. Calculations have shown that in an incident similar to that of 19 September, the collateral damage (to the interconnects and super-insulation) would be minor with this first phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase involves adding additional relief valves on all the dipole magnets and would guarantee minor collateral damage (to the interconnects and super-insulation) in all worst cases over the life of the LHC. One of the questions discussed in Chamonix was whether to warm up the whole LHC machine in 2009 so as to complete the installation of these new pressure relief valves or to perform these modifications on sectors that were warmed up for other reasons. The Management has decided for 2009 to install relief valves on the four sectors that were already foreseen to be warmed up. The dipoles in the remaining four sectors will be equipped in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/lhc-dipoles-1.jpg" title="LHC Dipole design"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/02/lhc-dipoles-1.jpg" width="350" alt="LHC Dipole design"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the delay would be a year, in total, was not unanticipated given the magnitude of the incident, and the good news here is that the root cause is now believed to be understood.  The retrofit to the quench detection and pressure relief systems should prevent this from happening or causing such great damage in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this was the worst of the birth pangs of the LHC!  With such a complex and enormous machine, however, it would be overly optimistic to hope that it will be the last.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment I work on, &lt;a href="http://cms.cern.ch/"&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt;, is open now and in March we are going to remove the innermost detectors, the forward pixels, do minor repairs, and reinstall them by mid-April.  We are taking advantage of the fact that so far, anyway, the detectors have not become radioactive from high intensity beam, after which any work on them will be far more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we are preparing to do the physics once we do get data.  The extra year, though painful, gave us extra time to refine our approaches, and physics will emerge faster as a result, I believe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, the economy's been in the crapper for several months now. Things are bad and getting worse, with the bottom not yet in sight. So who could prosper in this environment, except for repo men and liquor stores?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/wayoflife/02/05/psychics.economy/index.html"&gt;Psychics, of course&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK (CNN) --&lt;/strong&gt; The housing crisis will deepen, the country could fall into a depression and laid-off workers may need to start their own business.

&lt;p&gt;New York psychic Roxanne Usleman says the bad economy had been good for her business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like the advice of a financial planner or an economist, think again. It's a reading from psychic medium Roxanne Usleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the economy tanks, Usleman's business is booming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's more types of people I have never seen before," says Usleman. "Men in the business world, high-powered jobs, stock market, Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since last fall, she says she began to see a new type of client -- a "logical, [A-type] of personality." Many of them are "just completely lost," says Usleman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relationship advice, typically the bread and butter of the psychic business, has been supplanted by something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Should I merge with this company? Should I bring in a partner to my company," are the kind of questions Usleman gets from her clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn't realized that the desperation had gotten that bad. On the other hand, given how badly these guys' decisions have turned out and how the Wall Street class, through their shortsightedness and greed have managed to plunge the world into the worst recession since World War II, the wag in me can't resist wondering if their following the advice of a psychic could be any worse. I do, however, have to acknowledge one person quoted in the story as an early frontrunner for the award of Understatement of the Year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Financial adviser Ryan Mack says adding the cost of a psychic reading into an already stretched budget is not a good investment.

Joshua Tree National Park by Wendy L" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/301513681_25bda02686_m.jpg" height="240" alt="" width="180"&gt;There's been a lot of discussion about teacher Wendy Portillo and if &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/should_wendy_portillo_still_be_teaching"&gt;she should still be teaching&lt;/a&gt;: Last year, Portillo had her kindergarten class &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/different_you_dont_have_our_vote"&gt;vote out one of their classmates&lt;/a&gt;, then 5-year-old Alex Barton. The incident attracted national attention and discussion about teaching students with disabilities, the training of teachers, and much more. Portillo recently appealed her one-year-suspension and termination of her tenure. You can sign a pledge &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/make_wendy_portillo_accountable_of_emotional_abuse"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about making &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/make_wendy_portillo_accountable_of_emotional_abuse"&gt;Wendy Portillo accountable for emotional abuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about Alex's future?  Even if the incident had not been picked up by the national news media, I can't but think that there would not be some after-effects on him, after being "voted out" by his fellow students, with a teacher authorizing the vote. In the February 7th &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/feb/07/alex-tiegen-whats-next-alex-barton/"&gt;Palm Beach post&lt;/a&gt;, Alex Tiegen, who freelances for Scripps Treasure Coast Newspapers and other news organizations, writes about &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/feb/07/alex-tiegen-whats-next-alex-barton/"&gt;What's next for Alex Barton?&lt;/a&gt;. Tiegen notes that he himself has Asperger's Syndrome, undiagnosed when he was a child:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know Alex, and I don’t know how high-functioning he is. But I do know children with autism have long memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every time I speak to someone, my inner censor forces me to question whether what I’m saying or doing is appropriate. Not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine how loud and often my inner censor would scream if the majority of my peers had told me my behavior was wrong in a public forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the damage is done. Authorities are addressing the question of blame. The questions everyone should be asking now are: Will this one incident be allowed to define or shape Alex’s future? And upon whose shoulders does the responsibility for that future fall?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody involved in Alex’s story gets off the hook for what happens next. Not the school system. Not Alex’s next teacher. Not Alex’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not Alex himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will any teachers be able to teach Alex without fearing being blamed or excessively scrutinized? what choices will Melissa Barton, Alex's mother, have to make about his schooling? As Tiegen writes, the hardest tasks lie ahead for Alex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;.....the biggest burden will fall on Alex’s shoulders. It will be up to Alex to know when to trust others, and when to be wary. It’s up to him to understand the community’s expectations of him and to decide whether it’s in his best interests to satisfy those expectations or to create his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when all eyes are on Alex, if, when he starts attending a new school, whether public or private?  It's a huge question and I hope that teachers and educators and others can move beyond what happened in his kindergarten classroom and simply teach Alex, and provide him with the education and opportunities that he deserves as all students do. There's a long road ahead of him and all of us as we seek to answer these and other questions and to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;div style="width:100px;float:right;text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/singularly_silly_singularity/" title="Originally posted to Pharyngula, 21 September 2005"&gt;&lt;img alt="old pharyngula" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/images/old_pharyngula.gif" width="100" height="140" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_09/007172.php"&gt;Kevin Drum picks at Kurzweil&lt;/a&gt;—a very good thing, I think—and expresses bafflement at this graph (another version is &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/PPTParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.jpg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but it's no better):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/kurzweil_bad_graph.jpg.jpeg" width="400" height="304" alt="kurzweil_bad_graph.jpg.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Another try: here's a cleaner scan of the chart.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/singularity_lg.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/02/singularity.jpeg" width="425" height="390" alt="singularity.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, Kurzweil is predicting that the accelerating pace of technological development is going to lead to a revolutionary event called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"&gt;the Singularity&lt;/a&gt; in our lifetimes. Drum has extended his graph (the pink areas) to show that, if it were correct, these changes ought to be occurring at a still faster rate now…something we aren&amp;#39;t seeing. There&amp;#39;s something wrong in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I peered at that graph myself, and the flaws go even deeper. It's bogus through and through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil cheats. The most obvious flaw is the way he lumps multiple events together as one to keep the distribution linear. For example, one "event" is "Genus &lt;i&gt;Homo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt;, specialized stone tools", and another is "Printing, experimental method" and "Writing, wheel". If those were treated as separate events, they would have inserted major downward deflections in his chart a million years ago, and about 500 to a few thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biology is fudged, too. Other "events" are "Class &lt;i&gt;Mammalia&lt;/i&gt;", "Superfamily &lt;i&gt;Hominoidea&lt;/i&gt;", "Family &lt;i&gt;Hominidae&lt;/i&gt;", the species "&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;", and the subspecies "&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens sapiens&lt;/i&gt;". Think about it. If the formation of a species, let alone a subspecies, is a major event about a million years ago, why isn't each species back to the Cambrian awarded equivalent significance? Because it wouldn't fit his line, of course. As he goes back farther in time, he's using larger and larger artificial taxonomic distinctions to inflate the time between taxa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also simplifying the complex. "Spoken language" is treated as a discrete event, one little dot with a specific point of origin, as if it just poofed into existence. However, it was almost certainly a long-drawn-out, gradual process stretched out over hundreds of thousands of years. Primates communicate with vocalizations; why not smear that "spoken language" point into a fuzzy blur stretching back another million years or so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another problem: cows. If you&amp;#39;re going to use basic biology as milestones in the countdown to singularity, we can find similar taxonomic divisions in the cow lineage, so they were tracking along with us primates all through the first few billion years of this chart. Were they on course to the Singularity? Are they still? If not, why has the cow curve flattened out, and doesn&amp;#39;t that suggest that the continued linearity of the human curve is not an ineluctable trend? This objection also applies to every single species on the planet—ants, monkeys, and banana plants all exhibit a &amp;quot;trend&amp;quot; if you look backwards on it (a phenomenon Gould called &amp;quot;retrospective coronation&amp;quot;), and you can even pretend it is an accelerating trend if you gin it up by using larger and larger taxonomic divisions the farther back you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the technologies are selectively presented. Don't the Oldowan, Acheulian, and Mousterian stone tool technologies represent major advances? Why isn't the Levallois flake in the chart as a major event, comparable to agriculture or the Industrial Revolution? Copper and iron smelting? How about hygiene or vaccination? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll tell you why. Because not only is the chart an artificial and perhaps even conscious attempt to fit the data to a predetermined conclusion, but what it actually represents is the &lt;em&gt;proximity of the familiar&lt;/em&gt;. We are much more aware of innovations in our current time and environment, and the farther back we look, the blurrier the distinctions get. We may think it&amp;#39;s a grand step forward to have these fancy cell phones that don&amp;#39;t tie you to a cord coming from the wall, but there was also a time when people thought it was radical to be using this new bow &amp;amp; arrow thingie, instead of the good ol&amp;#39; atlatl. We just lump that prior event into a &amp;quot;flinging pointy things&amp;quot; category and don&amp;#39;t think much of it. When Kurzweil reifies biases that way, he gets garbage, like this graph, out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I do think that human culture has allowed and encouraged greater rates of change than are possible without active, intelligent engagement—but this techno-mystical crap is just kookery, plain and simple, and the rationale is disgracefully bad. One thing I will say for &lt;a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/"&gt;Kurzweil&lt;/a&gt;, though, is that he seems to be a first-rate bullshit artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think he'll be sending me a copy of his book to review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got one thing wrong in my original article: he &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; send me a copy of his book, &lt;i&gt;The Singularity is Near&lt;/i&gt;! I even read it. It was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of it was exactly like the example above: Kurzweil tosses a bunch of things into a graph, shows a curve that goes upward, and gets all misty-eyed and spiritual over our Bold Future. Some places it's OK, when he's actually looking at something measurable, like processor speed over time. In other places, where he puts bacteria and monkeys on the Y-axis and pontificates about the future of evolution, it's absurd. I am completely baffled by Kurzweil's popularity, and in particular the respect he gets in some circles, since his claims simply do not hold up to even casually critical examination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually am optimistic about technological progress, and I think some of the things he talks about (nanotechnology, AI, etc.) will come to pass. But I do not believe in the Singularity at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nanotech is overhyped, though. They seem to be aspiring to build little machines that do exactly what bacteria and viruses do right now…and don&amp;#39;t seem to appreciate the compromises and restrictions that are a natural consequence of multifunctional systems. I also don&amp;#39;t believe in the gray goo nightmare scenario: we&amp;#39;re already surrounded by a cloud of miniscule replicating machines that want to break our bodies down into their constituent molecules. We seem to cope, usually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we will develop amazing new technologies, and they will affect human evolution, but it will be nothing like what Kurzweil imagines. We have already experienced a &amp;#39;singularity&amp;#39; — the combination of agriculture, urbanization, and literacy transformed our species, but did not result in a speciation event, nor did it have quite the abrupt change an Iron Age Kurzweil might have predicted. Probably the most radical evolutionary changes would be found in our immune systems as we adapted to new diets and pathogens, but people are still people, and we can find cultures living a neolithic life style and an information age lifestyle, and they can still communicate and even interbreed. Maybe this information age will have as dramatic and as important an effect on humanity as the invention of writing, but even if it does, don&amp;#39;t expect a nerd rapture to come of it. Just more cool stuff, and a bigger, shinier, fancier playground for humanity to gambol about in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Darwin and Beyond: How Evolution Is Evolving"

&lt;p&gt;February 12, 2009&lt;br&gt;
6:30 pm - 7:30 pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us for a Darwin Day presentation by Carl Zimmer.  Mr. Zimmer is well known for his popular science writing, particularly his work on evolution.  He has published several books including Soul Made Flesh, a history of the brain, Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea, At the Water's Edge, a book about major transitions in the history of life, The Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins; and his latest book Microcosm: E. coli and the New Science of Life.  Mr. Zimmer contributes to the New York Times, National Geographic, Discover, Scientific American, Science, and Popular Science.  He also maintains an award winning blog The Loom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event is free, but the museum requests participants pre-register.  Register for the talk by sending an email to museum.reservations@ncmail.net. Please include your name, your email address and mention that this is in reference to Carl Zimmer's talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk Overview: Charles Darwin launched the modern science of evolution, but he hardly had the last word. In fact, today scientists are discovering that evolution works in ways Darwin himself could not have imagined. In my talk I will celebrate Darwin's achievements by looking at the newest discoveries about evolution, from the emergence of life to the dawn of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can't make it to the seminar? UNC-TV's North Carolina Now will broadcast an interview with Carl Zimmer Feb. 12, 7:30 pm.  The seminar will also be posted on this website in March, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk, Carl will meet with the local scientists, journalists, bloggers, people still under the influence of ScienceOnline09 and the ubiquitous traveling fan troupe at the &lt;a href="http://www.tylerstaproom.com/" title=""&gt;Tyler&amp;#39;s Restaurant &amp;amp; Taproom&lt;/a&gt; at 324 Blackwell St Durham, NC 27701 (&lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?num=100&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;newwindow=1&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;q=tyler%27s%20tavern%20durham%20map&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wl" title=""&gt;Map&lt;/a&gt;) starting at around 8:30pm (until kicked out by the bartenders at closing time, at least those of us with the most stamina who can stay up that long).  Please join us for the talk and the meetup if you can.&lt;/p&gt;

people making really sleazy arguments about the current financial stimulus 
package working its way through congress, and those arguments are a perfect
example of one of the classic ways of abusing statistics. I keep mentioning metric errors - this is another kind of metric error. The difference between this and some of the other examples that I've shown is that this is deliberately dishonest - that is, instead of accidentally using the wrong metric to get a wrong answer, in this case, we've got someone deliberately taking one metric, and pretending that it's an entirely different metric in order to produce a desired result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As I said, this case involves the current financial stimulus package that's working its way through congress. I want to put politics aside here: when it comes to things like this financial stimulus, there's plenty of room for disagreement. 
Economic crises like the one we're dealing with right now are really uncharted territory - they're very rare, and the ones that we have records of have each had enough unique properties that we don't have a very good collection of evidence
to use to draw solid conclusions about recoveries from them work. This isn't like
physics, where we tend to have tons and tons of data from repeatable experiments; we're looking at a realm where there are a lot of reasonable theories, and there isn't enough evidence to say, conclusively, which (if any) of them is correct. There are multiple good-faith arguments that propose vastly different ways of trying
to dig us out of this disastrous hole that we're currently stuck in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Of course, it's also possible to argue in &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; faith, by 
creating phony arguments. And that's the subject of this post: a bad-faith
argument that presents real statistics in misleading ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campaign has an ad that’s a bit edgy. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZPEUFsTu3E&amp;amp;fmt=18"&gt;I’ve embedded it below&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s probably NSFW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s pretty funny in a horrifying way (the look of shock and horror on the faces of the guys watching was OK, but nothing will ever beat the prison scene in &amp;quot;Hancock&amp;quot; for a reaction shot like that; you can search YouTube for it). I’d love to see the US gummint putting out ads like this, especially with measles outbreaks popping up around the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. S-CHIP was signed into law on Wednesday February 4!  Many of you wrote to your congress folks about SCHIP this past month, and took action right here in this space.  Whoot!  Not only did S-CHIP pass, but the event was attended by 6 national disability advocacy organizations--including the &lt;a href="http://change.org/autisticadvocacy"&gt;Autistic Self Advocacy Network&lt;/a&gt;.  Something about us &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; us!  Double-whoot!  A  &lt;a href="http://www.cspan.org/Watch/watch.aspx?MediaId=HP-A-15118"&gt;video of the signing&lt;/a&gt; is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. NEW ACTION: Our work on the stimulus package is still not over yet.  The senate is looking to cut out a lot of the disability-related funding that was passed in the house.  If you live in the U.S., please take a moment to tell Washington to &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/autisticadvocacy/actions/view/support_a_disability-friendly_stimulus"&gt;Support a Disability Friendly Stimulus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Because I love art and painting, and maybe some of you do too, Christian Parrotta does not need words to &lt;a href="http://www.acorn-online.com/joomla15/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=19512:exhibit-highlights-talents-of-autistic-teen&amp;amp;catid=10:greenwich-local&amp;amp;Itemid=1092"&gt;communicate his vision&lt;/a&gt;.  This article nicely let Christian's talent be his talent, no "despite" or "overcoming."  I quite enjoyed both Christian's art and the entire tone of the article itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Kristina has written about synaestesia a few times, and I must confess synaestesia is also a favorite topic of mine (I have sound as image/sensation primarily, and less strongly letters, numbers, weekdays, and months as color/shape/textures).  New Scientist reports a new genetics study which &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/55401/"&gt;claims to have found some of the regions in the genome responsible&lt;/a&gt; for sound as image synaestesia, and they are in some of the same regions that have been linked to autism and dyslexia.  This research has also shown that synaestesia is passable from fathers to sons (previously it was thought to be passed with the X chromosome).  I've not read the actual study so take the science reporting with a bit of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a clip from the Johnny Cash show in 1970, less than a year before Armstrong died.  It’s great to see these two performers together, but Armstrong’s playing is pretty restrained.  Here he is with Dizzie Gillespie, doing “Umbrella Man.”&lt;/p&gt;

This is a technical paper in philosophical semantics (it&amp;#39;s philosophy, not linguistics; and let me say that I do not necessarily endorse the view that it defends).  Hom outlines its aim on his website thus:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racial epithets are derogatory expressions, understood to convey contempt toward their targets.  But what do they actually mean, if anything?  While the prevailing view is that epithets are to be explained pragmatically, I argue that a careful consideration of the data strongly supports a particular semantic theory.  I call this view Combinatorial Externalism (CE).  CE holds that epithets express complex properties that are determined by the discriminatory practices and stereotypes of their corresponding racist institutions.  Depending on the character of the institution, the complex semantic value can be composed of a variety of components.  The account has significant implications on theoretical, as well as, practical dimensions, providing new arguments against radical contextualism, and for the exclusion of certain epithets from First Amendment speech protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Hom is offering a reasoned case that it is best to see the denigratory character of racial epithets as built into their actual conventional meanings, and not just as a possible concomitant of some of their occasional uses.  (Many of commenters seem to align with this view, though they tend to just assert it and call any other views absurd, rather than present arguments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the paper, Hom sets out his aims thus:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are two competing strategies for explaining how epithets work, one semantic and the other pragmatic. According to the semantic strategy, their derogatory content is fundamentally part of their literal meaning, and thus gets expressed in every context of utterance. This strategy honors the intuition that epithets literally say bad things, regardless of how they are used. According to the pragmatic strategy, their derogatory content is fundamentally part of how they are used, and results from features of the individual contexts surrounding their utterance. This strategy honors the intuition that epithets can be used for a variety of purposes, and that this complexity surrounding epithets precludes a univocal, context-independent explanation for how they work. Neither view is without difficulty, although to many the pragmatic strategy is prima facie more attractive. I shall argue, however, that the semantic strategy actually fares better on a number of criteria. In doing so, I shall motivate a particular semantic account of epithets that I call &lt;i&gt;combinatorial externalism&lt;/i&gt;. The account has significant implications on theoretical, as well as, practical dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In something of a departure for Language Log, which generally deals with material less technical than Hom's paper, I open the comments space below for use by &lt;b&gt;people who have read the paper&lt;/b&gt;, please, not just for opinions stimulated by the above summary, or (pretty please!) random observations about racism or nasty words.  I'll enforce the policy to the extent that time permits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Using soap stars and aging singers, most notably Dionne Warwick, to sell their “psychic” consultations for $3.99/minute on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, actress Vivica A. Fox recorded a spot for The Psychic Friends Network that never aired, &lt;a href="http://www.blackvoices.com/blogs/2009/02/03/buzz-exclusive-vivica-a-fox-talks-about-the-psychic-friends-ne/"&gt;until last week&lt;/a&gt;. Now Vivica is pissed, saying that the clip “is using her unauthorized likeness, footage, voice and photographs as an endorsement of their service.” She’s asking that The Psychic Friends Network “cease and desist immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things, here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Good luck getting the INTERNET to cease and desist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Why did she record the bit if she didn’t want to endorse their services?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Can you sue a company that went bankrupt in 1998?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Is psychicfriendsnetwork.net a different company entirely? It’s hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Didn’t she ask the Psychic Friends if something like this might happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Was she being held hostage by someone with a gun off-camera?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m totally serious about that last one. Watch the clip below and tell me she’s not acting very, very nervous, looking off to the side as if to say, “Is he still watching? Can I make a break for it? Can I encode a clever call for help that my family might recognize?” Here it is. Judge for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

And talk radio is hard work, so please knock it off with the challenging questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a scientist, I would not claim to be a scientist. When tested on the contents of the MMR vaccine I told the truth. I did not have the facts to hand. Was I ill informed? Yes.As a responsible broadcaster I should have been better prepared as a parent, however, I can fight my corner. I don’t know everything that goes into cigarettes but I do know they are harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do not accept that my position, as a radio broadcaster, is irresponsible if I should choose to share my own personal dilemma. I would like some of my critics to try and run a three hour programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “I am not a scientist” canard is a favorite among the vaccine illiterati. It frames the issue as “us against them.”  Instead of presenting science as a way of thinking that has served our species well over the last 400 years or so, the S-word becomes a stand-in for all the people Barnett disagrees with. So much easier to knock down straw men than actual facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnett could give her flagging confidence a boost if she took time to learn how science works. Fortunately, some of the comments on Barnett’s site address this very topic. Here are some of the very best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4 - Richard Thomsett:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence and “common sense” often lead us to wrong conclusions. That’s the whole point of the scientific method - we often spot patterns that aren’t really there, for example, and the scientific method helps us eliminate errors like these. This is why scientists can be so passionate about the results of their studies: they’ve performed incredibly in-depth, scrupulous research using the scientific method, and it can be very frustrating when people favour anecdotes or their uninformed gut feeling over this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#6 - David:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are not a liar, but, there is a difference between the truth and your opinion (one is based on unequivocal facts and the other is based on interpretation of facts and knowledge etc). In this case the scientific research shows that the jab is safe and the scientist who created the stir about autism has science been discredited and his work rubbished as inaccurate. Secondly, you mention cigarettes. I believe, like you, that they are not good for your health, but, why do you accept this research and not the MMR reasearch which shows that the jab is safe ?. Unfortunately, your minor celebrity status has given you extra weight behind scientific arguments that you have no grasp over with the public at large. How did you come to your conclusions, why do you believe one scientist against the many in one case and the reverse in another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#8 - Simon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike a scientist, it appears you have already made up your mind what you believe before looking at the evidence. You have also decided that ‘others’ (I assume you mean those that accept conventional scientific theories and evidence-based medicine) aren’t interested, or are somehow suppressing, alternative medicines. In fact, many alternative medicines (for example St John’s Wort) have been extensively investigated and are realised to be efficacious. One final point. I completely agree, you should be allowed to voice an opinion (as does everyone) but surely you understand that your opinion is not as valid as, for example, the professional opinion of a doctor? You crave a debate, yet when people (with perhaps a slightly greater understanding of the evidence than you) disagree with your opinion, you describe them as ‘vicious.’ If everyone agrees, then it isn’t a debate is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s encouraging to see the commune rising up against the old media overlords. &lt;em&gt;Vive la resistance&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

In 2003, at age 22, he published a Swedish translation of the Baal cycle and other Canaanite mythological matter for the lay reader. In the five years since then, he's done the Enuma Elish, the Chaldaean oracles, an essay collection on ancient languages, a popular introduction to Indo-europan studies and a historical mystery novel co-written with his dad. His PhD thesis on the relationship between certain themes in Ugaritic and Old Testament mythology is due in 2011. In his spare time he &lt;a href="http://ola-wikander.blogspot.com/"&gt;blogs in Swedish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://necrolinguist.blogspot.com/"&gt;English&lt;/a&gt; (Ola, I can't find a blog in Ugaritic!) and translates manga for his girlfriend. We're dealing with a hugely talented young scholar with a keen interest in popularisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikander's talk at the Classical Society's annual meeting was lively, interesting and entertaining. He spoke on the subject of his thesis, looking at the fascinating relationship between texts about Jahwe in the Old Testament and others about Baal from several centuries before. Essentially, within the context of mythology they're the same guy: a storm god called "the Lord" who kicks the Sea Monster's ass. Yet much of the Old Testament chronicles the struggle between Jahwe's and Baal's priesthoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This all brought some old thoughts of mine back to the fore. How do we know if two fictional characters are separate or identical? Me and Ola Wikander are not the same person. He's younger, shorter, has different eye and hair colours, and tens of people saw us talking to each other the other night. But nobody ever sees Jahwe and Baal chatting. In fact, all we have about them is mythological reports on what they are like. And these reports are uncannily similar, as they recycle a lot of generic mythological tropes about storm gods that were knocking about promiscuously in the Near East in the Bronze Age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Norse mythology, Odinn shows up under a load of different identities. Snorri lists many names for this character, one of them being "The Masked One". Scholars of religion will quite happily say about a character in a text that "this is most likely Odinn in disguise". What do they mean by that? Sometimes they mean that the author of the text intends us to identify the mysterious stranger as Odinn the Masked One. But in other cases, they mean that there was once a group of people who believed that it was Odinn, but that by the time the myth in question was codified, this knowledge had been lost. Likewise with the heroes of the Mabinogion: textual notes inform the reader that "this guy is probably the god Lugh though the writer of the text is not aware of it". And conversely, famously, with the many avatars of the Hindu gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ambiguity of "ontological status" really bothers me when I read about mythology. I understand that it's a convenient shorthand to speak of gods being this and doing that just in the same way that Ola Wikander &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a talented philologist and &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; give good lectures. But I'd like the verb "to be" to mean the same thing throughout a text. Saturday, when I suggested that the distinction between Jahwe and Baal is redundant, Wikander replied that "No, they are two gods competing for the same mythological material". I don't agree. Jahwe and Baal exist only as mythological material, and if the two sets of writings are closely similar, then the two are indistinguishable, comparable to two entries on Snorri's list of Odinn's names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am however willing to concede that Jahwe/Baal is not identical to Mickey Mouse, because I met him once at Disney World and he was nothing like the god of the Old Testament.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/02/ola_wikander_and_fictional_bei.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/S-w1vwgXtzE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234193869171"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7497030302979537400">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6092961912555ce1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #107</title><published>2009-02-09T15:24:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T15:36:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/02/mondays-molecule-107.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html">  This Monday&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;molecule&amp;quot; looks a lot like an electron micrograph of a cell instead of a molecule.

Here's a &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/questions-darwinism-cannot-answer/2009/02/08/1234027847281.html"&gt;regrettable example of an ignorant opinion piece&lt;/a&gt;, one so egregiously stupid that even &lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2009/02/sheer-stupdity.html"&gt;Ian Musgrave is reduced to indignant spluttering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem I face is weariness with science-based dialogue partners like Richard Dawkins. It surprises me he is not chided for his innate scientific conservatism and metaphysical complacency. He won't take his depiction of Darwinism to logical conclusions. A dedicated Darwinian would welcome imperialism, genocide, mass deportation, ethnic cleansing, eugenics, euthanasia, forced sterilisations and infanticide. Publicly, he advocates none of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think that, since Darwin himself did not consider any of those actions to be either commendable or a consequence of his theory, &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; someone would realize that perhaps those aren't logical conclusions of "Darwinism". You would &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; that somebody would consider that, while Newton described the acceleration of falling bodies accurately, it does not imply in any way that he he advocated pushing people off of tall buildings.  Rational people might be able to see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author of the piece is a professor of theology, though, so we ought to have lower expectations. I'm pretty sure he is probably capable of eating with a fork without putting his eye out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/the_other_side_of_the_coin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/un9zLGJqC8Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234193069405"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/if_only_more_journalists_had_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28c0ac9670b0c7e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History"/><title type="html">If only more journalists had this attitude…</title><published>2009-02-09T13:29:41Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T13:29:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/I4FtDrua354/if_only_more_journalists_had_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/if_only_more_journalists_had_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I must recommend an &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/feb/09/charles-darwin-anniversary"&gt;excellent editorial in the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Somebody there gets it; all the "he said she said" journalism that we get is a failure of the media to get to the basic truth of a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There can be no such equivocation in the week of a survey which showed that only around half of all Britons accept that Darwin's theory of evolution is either true or probably true. In a democracy, citizens should respect each other's beliefs; and citizens have a right to express their beliefs. But in a democracy, a newspaper has an obligation to what is right. The truth is that Darwin's reasoning has in the last 150 years been supported overwhelmingly by discoveries in biology, geology, medicine and space science. The details will keep scientists arguing for another 200 years, but the big picture has not changed. All life is linked by common ancestry, including human life. The shameful lesson of this 200th anniversary of his birth is that Darwin's contemporaries understood more clearly than many modern Britons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's the lesson to be taught in this week, at the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth. There is a hard core of fact to science, and all the waffling about to negate the ideas of common descent and natural selection is driven by ideology, not evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/if_only_more_journalists_had_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/I4FtDrua354" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234191599240"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/stephdau-you-should-know-by-n/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f7802ee99e075877</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">@stephdau you should know by n…</title><published>2009-02-09T14:49:50Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T14:49:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/02/stephdau-you-should-know-by-n/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;@stephdau you should know by now, @mricon is ungrokable&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234191503376"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_595.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9fa66f1eb484118b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-09T13:54:58Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T13:54:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/xCDDzz919kE/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_595.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_595.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_595.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_595.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/xCDDzz919kE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234191072539"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/09/measles-on-the-rise-in-australia-and-switzerland-too/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09fc97d69a9e8ce2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Measles on the rise in Australia and Switzerland, too</title><published>2009-02-09T14:11:23Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T14:11:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/09/measles-on-the-rise-in-australia-and-switzerland-too/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At what point do start to hold antivaxxers responsible? I ask, because &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/warning-over-biggest-measles-outbreak-in-years-20090204-7xjl.html"&gt;we’re on the verge of a record year for measles in Australia&lt;/a&gt;: in Victoria, 11 cases have been reported in 2009 so far. That’s far more more than in 2006 and 2007 combined, and under extrapolation is as bad as an outbreak in 1999 where over 100 cases were reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that weren’t enough, &lt;a href="http://genevalunch.com/2009/02/05/vaud-measles-outbreak-unprecedented/"&gt;Switzerland has had 22 cases reported&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in two days&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is antivax rhetoric to blame here? The Australian article doesn’t say how many of these people were not vaccinated; several were adults, so they should have been vaccinated well before this craze of linking vaccines to health problems started up. But some kids were on that list, and I wonder if they were vaccinated, and if not, why not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for the outbreak in Switzerland, &lt;a href="http://www.promedmail.org/pls/otn/f?p=2400:1001:1499995194585538::NO::F2400_P1001_BACK_PAGE,F2400_P1001_PUB_MAIL_ID:1000,76009"&gt;it does look like antivaccination insanity is to blame&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switzerland has been affected by measles outbreaks more than other European countries in recent years because of the relatively low level of vaccinations and the presence of educational and religious communities that decline vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak described here indicates that anthroposophic communities are an at-risk group, because many parents in these groups choose not to vaccinate their children with the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine. Anthroposophy, based on the writings of the social philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), combines human development with an investigation of the divine spark found in all of nature. Anthroposophical doctors emphasize nature-based therapies that&lt;br&gt;
support the body’s innate healing wisdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antivaxxers. For whatever reasons they believe what they do, &lt;strong&gt;they’re wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.lenouvelliste.ch/fr/news/flash_info/index.php?idIndex=468&amp;amp;idContent=129815"&gt;A previously healthy 12-year-old girl died of measles-induced encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; in a Geneva hospital last week. In 2008, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/24/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-from-a-preventable-disease/"&gt;a child in Minnesota died&lt;/a&gt; due to a disease that was preventable through a vaccine. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/06/uk-in-trouble-measles-antivax-garbage-on-the-rise/"&gt;Measles is on the rise in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. And some people are all too happy to spread the lie that the vaccines are causing all sorts of health problems, &lt;a href="http://www.pkids.org/im_vs_mmr.php"&gt;when it’s been shown pretty conclusively that they aren’t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pernicious bit of antiscience has a body count. &lt;em&gt;Kids are dying&lt;/em&gt;. And they will continue to do so unless we make ourselves heard. Vaccines do have a health risk, but it’s minuscule compared to the very real threat of measles, rubella, mumps, Hib, and many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctors. Do the research. Jenny McCarthy and her followers are wrong. How many children will get sick, how many will die, before everyone understands that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, “balanced treatment” and “equal time” bills for “creation science” led to the 1987 SCOTUS decision in &lt;em&gt;Edwards v. Aguillard&lt;/em&gt; that ruled “creation science” as unconstitutional. Wise’s bill, if worded as stated in the article, is likely to provide a complementary court case for “intelligent design”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(See the &lt;a href="http://www.flascience.org/wp/?p=895" rel="external "&gt;Florida Citizens for Science&lt;/a&gt; post on this, and the original post at the &lt;a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2009/02/08/florida-reliving-the-past/" rel="external "&gt;Austringer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wise said that if the Legislature passes the bill, he wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a legal challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You just never know. They use the courts all the time. I guess if they have enough money they can get it in the courts,” he said. “Someplace along the line you’ve got to be able to make a value judgment of what it is you think is the appropriate thing.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sen. Wise, just a note… if “intelligent design” creationism were able to make a convincing case to the scientific community, there wouldn’t be any issue about it being suitable as accountable science content for the public school science classrooms. But IDC is clearly religious antievolution, a narrow sectarian viewpoint without scientific standing or accountability, that you are inappropriately trying to insert by the political process rather than having it demonstrate its merit. People end up using the courts because of the bad behavior of people like you. It is where they can get redress for what you’ve done. It is not unseemly behavior on their part to take up the only route for redress that you have left open to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it comes to it, I hope to render my assistance to those who will oppose you in court, much as I did in 2005 for the &lt;em&gt;Kitzmiller v. DASD&lt;/em&gt; case in Pennsylvania.

Tym razem padło na &lt;a href="http://www.teluk.net/"&gt;Tomasza Teluka&lt;/a&gt; z libertariańskiego &lt;a href="http://www.globalizacja.org/"&gt;Instytutu Globalizacji&lt;/a&gt;. Do tej samej organizacji należy inny pan, który wystąpił w &lt;a href="http://modnebzdury.blogspot.com/2009/01/antyterrorysta-amator.html"&gt;programie&lt;/a&gt; Bronisława Wildsteina o "ekoterroryzmie". Sam Teluk jest autorem niedawno wydanej książki pt. &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.globalizacja.org/mitologia.php"&gt;"Mitologia efektu cieplarnianego&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;. Patronat medialny nad tym tytułem objęła właśnie &lt;span&gt;Rzeczpospolita&lt;/span&gt;, która - jak mniemam - uznała, że jest to pozycja wartościowa. Po &lt;a href="http://www.rp.pl/artykul/132583,258445_Ekologiczny_biznes_zada_ofiar_z_ludzi_.html"&gt;lekturze wywiadu&lt;/a&gt; z Telukiem mam pewne wątpliwości czy redaktorzy tego dziennika dokonali właściwej decyzji. Być może uznali, że skoro ideowo Teluk jest im bliski (libertarianin i katolik starej szkoły), to część merytoryczna nie jest już tak istotna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Na wstępie muszę znaznaczyć, iż nie wiadomo o czym tak naprawdę jest ten wywiad. O złych ekologach, którzy chcą ratować ukochane drzewa kosztem ludzi? O klimacie? O nauce?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Na pewno nie o nauce. W całym wywiadzie nie pada ani razu słowo "nauka". Trochę to dziwne, że w rozmowie, która przynajmniej częściowo traktuje o zmianach klimatycznych (a więc siłą rzeczy musi opierać się na wynikach badań klimatologicznych) z taką determinacją unika się odwołań do klimatologii. Mam na ten temat swoją hipotezę. Jak wiadomo, nauka nadal cieszy się dość dużym szacunkiem i każdy, kto kontestuje twierdzenia ekspertów jest w dość trudnej sytuacji, gdy chce przekonać do swoich racji laików. Teluk doskonale zdaje sobie z tego sprawę, więc celowo unika jakichkolwiek odwołań do nauki i próbuje stworzyć wrażenie, że jedyną grupą, która mówi o zmianach klimatycznych są ekolodzy. A kto by się przejmował, co mówią XXI-wieczni luddyści? Po co czytać specjalistyczne raporty i prace naukowe, a następnie próbowac z  nimi polemizować, skoro można po prostu stwierdzieć, że to tylko wymysł "zielonych", którzy coś tam sobie wydumali? Sprytnie rozegrany ruch! Niekoniecznie uczciwy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zabawy językiem i próby uniknięcia dyskusji o skomplikowanych kwestiach klimatologii to jedynie wstęp do rozprawy z "mitem efektu cieplarnianego". Teluk przywołuje na obronę swojego stanowiska kilka twierdzeń. Zajmijmy się ich oceną merytoryczną.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twierdzenie pierwsze:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Gdyby nie ocieplenie klimatu, to trwanie życia na Ziemi nie byłoby możliwe&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Mielibyśmy warunki marsjańskie, gdzie różnica temperatury pomiędzy dniem a nocą może wynosić kilkaset stopni.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Telukowi chodzi być może o &lt;a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacja%C5%82"&gt;interglacjał&lt;/a&gt; czyli:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(...) okres międzylodowcowy to okres między dwoma glacjałami, w którym wskutek ocieplenia czyli wzrostu temperatury powierzchnia lodowca cofa się lub ustępuje z danego obszaru (deglacjacja).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Problem w tym, że naukowcy (i ekolodzy), gdy mówią o antropogenicznym ociepleniu klimatu mówią o &lt;span&gt;czymś innym &lt;/span&gt;niż o okresie międzylodowcowym&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Teluk popełnia tutaj &lt;a href="http://www.slownik-online.pl/kopalinski/7A9AECCA5EC4A591C12565BD0057FAD5.php"&gt;błąd ekwiwokacji&lt;/a&gt;. Używa &lt;span&gt;jednego&lt;/span&gt; terminu "ocieplenie klimatu" na określenie &lt;span&gt;dwóch różnych&lt;/span&gt; zjawisk. Oczywiście, że gdyby nie obecny interglacjał, to życie na Ziemii wyglądałoby inaczej, ale przecież nikt z tym nie dyskutuje, więc po co o tym pisać? Nikt przecież nie twierdzi, że Ziemia powinna być skuta lodem albo przypominać Marsa. Z kim Teluk tutaj w ogóle dyskutuje?  &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twierdzenie drugie:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Już dzieci w podstawówce się uczą, że CO2 jest gazem życiodajnym. Zawdzięczamy mu wzrost zielonej roślinności, która w procesie fotosyntezy wytwarza tlen, którym oddychamy. Tymczasem ekolodzy wmawiają ludziom, że to jest trucizna zagrażająca planecie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Zgadza się, już dzieci wiedzą, że CO2 jest gazem życiodajnym (we właściwej ilości i obok setek innych związków chemicznych). Natomiast CO2 może też być &lt;a href="http://mediweb.pl/firstaid/wyswietl_vad.php?id=60"&gt;trucizną&lt;/a&gt; i jego nadmiar w atmosferze może mieć negatywne skutki dla biosfery. Te dwie rzeczy się nie wykluczają. Teluk albo nie wie, albo udaje, że nie wie, że co za dużo to niezdrowo. Znowu, nikt nie przeczy, że CO2 jest niezbędny do życia, problemem jest jego &lt;span&gt;nadmiar&lt;/span&gt; w atmosferze. &lt;span&gt;Telukowskie&lt;/span&gt; "ekolodzy wmawiają ludziom, że to jest trucizna zagrażająca planecie" to nic innego jak zwykła "słomiana kukła" aka &lt;a href="http://www.logic.amu.edu.pl/images/3/34/Semlogzim07.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;straw man fallacy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ("wypaczenie myśli oponenta i przedstawienie jego argumentu w taki sposób, aby łatwo sie było z nim rozprawić").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teluk najwidoczniej kopiuje &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/05/thank-you-for-emitting/"&gt;taktykę&lt;/a&gt; amerykańskich think tanków libertariańskich, które w swojej desperacji posunęły się do PR'owskich haseł typu: "'CO2: they call it pollution, we call it &lt;span&gt;Life!&lt;/span&gt;'". Niektórzy sceptycy lubią też twierdzić, że więcej CO2 doprowadzi większego rozrostu roślinności (w tym także żywności), co polepszy, a nie pogorszy stan środowiska i los człowieka. Ten zdroworozsądkowy argument ma tą wadę, że jest... oparty na zdrowym rozsądku, który niewiele ma wspólnego z metodą naukową. Niestety &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/11/co_2-fertilization/"&gt;badania&lt;/a&gt;, które przeprowadzono &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11655"&gt;nie potwierdzają&lt;/a&gt; tej hipotezy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twierdzenie trzecie:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Obecny poziom gazów cieplarnianych jest bliski czasom rewolucji przemysłowej.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Natural_and_anthropogenic"&gt;Nieprawda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twierdzenie czwarte:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Człowiek swoją działalnością generuje niewielkie ilości tych gazów. Za 98 proc. emisji odpowiedzialne są morza i oceany, które w procesie parowania oddają CO2 do atmosfery. Idąc tropem logiki ekologów, należałoby stwierdzić, że to naturalne zbiorniki wodne są naszym wrogiem. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pokazując, że człowiek w porównaniu do oceanów i biosfery emituje mało CO2 Teluk stara się nas przekonać, człowiek że nie może negatywnie wpływać na klimat. Problem w tym, że jego rozumowanie jest błędne, choć jego porównanie ilości emitowanego CO2 jest prawdziwe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oceany i biosfera rzeczywiście produkują więcej CO2 niż człowiek, ale istnieje naturalny cykl, w którym natura radzi sobie z absoropcją CO2, który sama wyprodukuje. Problem polega na tym, że te&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11638"&gt; dodatkowe 2% CO2 emitowane przez człowieka zaburza naturalny cykl&lt;/a&gt; powodując zmiany klimatyczne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rozumiem oburzenie na wypowiedź Jonathona Porritta, który "nawołuje do wprowadzenia limitu na rodzenie dzieci, dotowania aborcji i antykoncepcji, a także zaprzestania leczenia ludzi śmiertelnie chorych". Ale czy naprawdę muszą za tym iść mocno zużyte klisze klimatycznych sceptyków? Po raz kolejny okazuje się, że dla wielu ideowców, w tym przypadku libertartian, ważniejsze od dokładności i prawdziwości wypowiadanych twierdzeń, jest wierność swoim przekonaniom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>Modne Bzdury</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234184796466"><id gr:original-id="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/?p=185">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a85f9cd2fa1edc82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Jeni Barnett Does Not Get It</title><published>2009-02-08T17:37:58Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T17:37:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jaycueaitch.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/jeni-barnett-does-not-get-it/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]Jeni Barnett is excusing herself on her blog.

&lt;p&gt;For example, hair analysis (see &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2008/12/23/woo-woo-jumps-on-the-hair-analysis-drug-testing-bandwagon/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/science-under-siege-the-deliberate-hijacking-of-real-science-by-alternative-medicine/"&gt;and here&lt;/a&gt;) proponents who claim to able to cure all manner of incurable illnesses by identifying food allergies with magic machines are particularly offensive to me. Advice such as, “Just cut out tomatoes and walnuts, drink gin but not wine and your terminal cancer will magically go away” are just about the lowest of lows in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I heard about a new scam artist on the prowl in Sydney. His name is Brad Paxton, a man with no medical or scientific training but who claims to have invented or discovered an organic formula to cure AIDS, cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure. A report by &lt;a href="http://www.starobserver.com.au/author/harley"&gt;Harley Dennett&lt;/a&gt; detailing these claims appeared in the &lt;a href="http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/2009/02/04/aids-cure-scam-alarm/4072"&gt;Sydney Star Observer&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday February 5 th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report states the man, who runs a skylight installation business on the Northern beaches “produced magnified pictures of blood cells to justify his cure claim” (which sounds suspiciously like &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2008/10/09/live-blood-analysis-hocus-pocus/"&gt;live blood analysis&lt;/a&gt; to me..). According to the report, he would not let the Star Observer retain the photos for examination claiming; &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve got the negatives but I’d rather keep those in a top secret facility”. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The pharmaceuticals don’t want this getting out, so I’m trying to keep it low profile with like-minded people I can trust”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Star Observer reports Paxton has previously been investigated by the &lt;a href="http://www.tga.gov.au/"&gt;Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;/a&gt; (TGA). On this occasion, Paxton has allegedly been soliciting for donations to fund a backyard trial for his top secret cure-all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Sean Emery from the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research said anyone claiming a cure or asking for money should set off alarm bells. “Often people who peddle these things say there’s a conspiracy against them, that the drug companies don’t want you to know about their treatments”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soliciting donations for a dubious clinical trial is not illegal in Australia but the government’s &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/scamwatch.gov.au"&gt;SCAMwatch&lt;/a&gt; website advises victims to report cases to authorities via SCAMwatch or directly to the &lt;a href="http://www.tgacrp.com.au/index.cfm"&gt;TGA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/</id><title type="html">The Skeptics&amp;#39; Book of Pooh-Pooh</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234183857581"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/autism_quackery_invades_my_hometown_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d69255a985f20ab0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment/culture"/><title type="html">Autism quackery invades my hometown, part II</title><published>2009-02-09T12:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T12:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/rrWe0MN2EC0/autism_quackery_invades_my_hometown_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/autism_quackery_invades_my_hometown_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no way of knowing if the media in my hometown happen to be more credulous when it comes to pseudoscience than average, but, given the number of stories referred to me emanating from Detroit and its surrounding suburbs, you'll forgive me if I'm very depressed right now. For instance, we have "investigative reporter" &lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/content/about7/bios/story/Steve-Wilson-7-Action-News-Reporter-Chief/sMG-Tcbw1UK_W-2iuqTRrQ.cspx"&gt;Steve Wilson of WXYZ Channel 7 Action News&lt;/a&gt;, who, although claiming the title of "Chief Investigator" for that station, clearly couldn't investigate his way out of a paper bag--at least when it comes to medical stories--given that he is known for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/investigative_reporter_steve_wilson_of_w.php"&gt;routinely parroting pseudoscience and antivaccine misinformation about thimerosal-containing vaccines&lt;/a&gt; that even the mercury militia &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/05/even_the_zealots_cant_defend_this_hypoth.php"&gt;has abandoned as being too discredited&lt;/a&gt;. They've moved on to various other dubious hypotheses, such as other "toxins" in vaccines and the claim that children are getting "too many too soon," both of which have the advantage for the antivaccine movement that they are much more difficult to falsify scientifically than the thimerosal hypothesis--if they are falsifiable at all. Indeed, Wilson's "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/07/antivax_lies_from_a_local_repo.php"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt;" in this issue was so...2005. Then we have the same station (although not Steve Wilson this time) &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/07/the_stupid_contuines_at_channe.php"&gt;reporting misinformation about Gardasil&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, it's not just about autism and vaccines, either. About a year ago, there was an unbelievably, mind-numbingly credulously idiotic &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_orbs_invade_the.php"&gt;story on the local news about orbs&lt;/a&gt;. It was so bad that I did an installment of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, in some of the local newspapers, particularly the &lt;a href="http://www.hometownlife.com/"&gt;Observer-Eccentric&lt;/a&gt; group, whose combined newspapers cover a large swath of the Detroit suburbs, there are similar problems. For example, as I described in Part I of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/autism_quackery_invades_my_hometown.php"&gt;Autism quackery invades my hometown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Plymouth Observer&lt;/em&gt; published a puff piece about a mother of an autistic child named Val McFarland, whose charity &lt;a href="http://www.celebritiesagainstautism.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Celebrities Against Autism&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with &lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;. Neither McFarlane nor the reporter who wrote that article, seem aware that Generation Rescue is not a benign "autism charity" nor is Jenny McCarthy doing good work as a celebrity supporter of autism research, but rather GR is virulently antivaccine and arguably the wealthiest and most famous propaganda organ for the antivaccine movement. Indeed, Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey have become its celebrity spokespeople, spreading the antivax gospel far and wide, with a resurgence of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_jenny_mccarthy.php"&gt;vaccine-preventable infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; following in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I've discovered through my contacts that the &lt;em&gt;Plymouth Observer&lt;/em&gt; has done it again. Actually, the entire &lt;em&gt;Observer-Eccentric&lt;/em&gt; group of newspapers has done it again. That&amp;#39;s because all of its papers are in essence versions of one main newspaper with features that appear globally in every newspaper, but with each newspaper customized with local news and views specific to the community in which it is distributed. Apparently, the Health &amp;amp; Fitness section appears in all these papers, which gives it a wide distribution in the Detroit suburbs. Behold an example of truly bad journalism entitled &lt;a href="http://www.hometownlife.com/article/20090208/HEALTH/902080338/1006"&gt;Controversial treatments for autism&lt;/a&gt;. It's so bad that it doesn't even just "tell both sides" with the false "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/run_dont_walk_from_these_doctors.php"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;" that seemingly elevates pseudoscience to somewhere near the same order of magnitude in terms of measures of credibility as science and contributes to the impression that there is a scientific controversy when in reality it's a &lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/04/manufactroversy/"&gt;manufactroversy&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the reporter, Linda Ann Chomin, couldn't be bothered to provide any actual token quotes by scientists or skeptics. No, it's all antivaccination propaganda all the time, with Chomin the credulous mouthpiece. Indeed, it's everything I hate about bad science journalism concentrated into a single 1,000-word apologia for the antivaccine views. It &lt;a href="http://www.hometownlife.com/article/20090208/HEALTH/902080338/1006"&gt;begins&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/autism_quackery_invades_my_hometown_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/autism_quackery_invades_my_hometown_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/rrWe0MN2EC0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234183686724"><id gr:original-id="96 at http://www.baskeptics.org">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c891358426e48afe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pseudo-science" scheme="http://www.baskeptics.org/category/pseudo-science"/><title type="html">Water Witches</title><published>2009-02-09T12:07:10Z</published><updated>2009-02-09T12:07:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.baskeptics.org/blog/09/02/096-water-witches" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.baskeptics.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Farmers are turning to &lt;strong&gt;water witching&lt;/strong&gt; during the long Californian drought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drought has lasted for two years so far, and desperate farmers are seeking assistance from dowsers in &lt;strong&gt;Firebaugh&lt;/strong&gt;, near &lt;strong&gt;Fresno&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bad-language.com/images/waterdowsing.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="15" align="left" title="A Water Dowser"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/dowsing.html"&gt;Water witching&lt;/a&gt;, better known as &lt;strong&gt;water divining&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;water dowsing&lt;/strong&gt;, is the practice of locating water, metal, lost objects or people using sticks, wires, rods, pendulums or other instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bad-language.com/images/pendulum.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="10" align="right" title="A pendulum for prediction or divination"&gt;By any name, with any device, it has never been proven to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supposed success rate of dowsers is "100%", but the evidence is anecdotal. Not what I would want to rely on before spending thousands of dollars digging the earth on a "hunch".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dowser's responses are best explained scientifically as the&lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/ideomotor.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Ideomotor Effect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water Diving tests have been the staple claim of the &lt;strong&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation's&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html"&gt;Million Dollar Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptics.com.au/prizes/challenge.htm"&gt;$100,000 Challenge&lt;/a&gt; offered by the &lt;strong&gt;Australian Skeptics&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under double-blind tests, dowsers have never demonstrated that their object hunting abilities achieve results better than chance...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also just surf around in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stboed/2964427022/in/set-72157600241346073/"&gt;stboed’s photostream&lt;/a&gt;–lots of neat photos like this one there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, since there are lots of academics here–how do you feel about &lt;a href="http://globalcomment.com/2009/thats-dr-biden-to-you/"&gt;Ms. Biden wanting her title to be used&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;strong&gt;Miss&lt;/strong&gt; Bug Girl by students, while my male colleagues get to be called &lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;/strong&gt;Whosit, I understand where she’s coming from.  (And I bet none of the male faculty I work with have ever been mistaken for a secretary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would anyone have bothered to write about this if Dr. Biden was a dude?  (Aside from the wonderful happenstance of a gay couple as VPs during &lt;a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/get_involved/2009/pledge.php"&gt;Freedom to Marry Week&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;

As a former religion reporter for the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; he knows how to write in ways that make us feel and think what he does, every step along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previously I had said Joe Holman’s book, &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1909682"&gt;Project Bible Truth&lt;/a&gt;, was the most extensive deconversion story I had ever read. But now I must say Lobdell’s book is the most extensive one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lobdell’s book does not focus on the arguments against Christianity, like Holman does, although they are there. Rather he takes us on a journey from his evangelical faith to almost becoming a Catholic to what he describes as a “reluctant atheist” or “skeptical deist.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lobdell lost his religion on the religion beat: “Like a homicide detective, I had seen too much.” (p. 253). At first he liked his job and it didn’t affect his faith at all. But his doubt started when covering the scandal of Catholic priest molestations and interviewing the victims who were lied to and ignored by the church. For him the most egregious problem wasn’t necessarily the molestations and the ignored children sired from the affairs the priests had with women, although that was bad enough. No. It was the cover-up that the well-organized Catholic Church had for defending them. He just couldn’t understand, nor should anyone for that matter, why the church hierarchy didn’t do as Jesus wanted them to do in upholding the dignity and rights of the downtrodden and the abused. According to him, “the real story wasn’t about the molester priests, but rather the bishops who covered up for them and caused thousands of additional children to be sodomized, orally copulated, raped and masturbated.” (p. 142).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One missionary priest at St. Michael Island, Alaska, “raped an entire generation of Alaska Native boys.” (p. 215) “Though the Jesuits deny it,” Lobdell writes, “there’s evidence to suggest that the villages of western Alaska served as a dumping ground for molesting priests.” (p. 228) Lobdell called this a “pedophile’s paradise.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he reported on these abuses he was preparing to become a Catholic himself, and we see him struggle with this decision as he covers the story. Two weeks before doing so he couldn’t go through it. In his words: “Converting to Catholicism during the height of a horrific scandal felt like an endorsement of the establishment,” (p. 158) something he just couldn’t do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He described going to a “survivor’s meeting” and concurs with Thomas Doyle, a leading advocate for victims of clergy sexual abuse, that molesting priests and their superiors were committing “soul murder.” (p. 105) As he recounts it, the church “acted more like Mafia bosses than shepherds.” (p. 119). And he asked himself this question: “If an institution is corrupt, does that have any bearing on God?” (p. 135). He thinks it does. In fact, he started to see that “religious institutions are MORE susceptible to corruption than their secular counterparts because of their reliance on God, and not human checks and balances, for governance.” (p. 161)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lobdell covered stories about the Mormons and their lifestyle, which were “mesmerizing.” (p. 122), although their beliefs were “nutty.” (p. 124). He recounted their strange beliefs, despite the fact that scientific evidence from DNA shows us “descendants of American Indians came from Asia, not the Middle East.” (p. 280) And he asks: “what’s so strange about Mormonism compared to traditional Christianity?” (p. 126). He himself didn’t see the disconnect at this stage in his faith journey, but he said, “I just happened to have grown up with the stories of the Bible. I was more used to them.” (p. 127) Indeed, that's the only difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lobdell covered some evangelical TV Evangelist scandals, like Robert Tilton, whose ministry placed the donation checks in one pile and the prayer requests in the dumpster; and Benny Hinn, who raised funds for an alleged $30 million healing center in Dallas, Texas, which was never built; and Trinity Broadcasting Network founders Paul and Jan Crouch, who covered up Paul's homosexual tryst, and Paul's forcing a woman to have sex with him. (pp. 173-197). Lobdell asked himself why his faith “had so few people of principle.” (p. 187).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lobdell reveals the mental gymnastics of believers in defending their faith and institutions when criticized. After he wrote about TV evangelist Robert Tilton’s financial abuses Tilton subsequently used this criticism by claiming he must be doing something right because Satan (i.e. Lobdell) was attacking him, and donations kept coming in. When a Catholic priest resigned after admitting he had “inappropriate contact” with a child 19 years previously, some parishioners suggested naming the new church wing after him for his years of service in the 19 years since then, failing to realize that pedophiles will only admit to the evil deeds they were forced to admit. Pedophiles usually have many more victims, as Lobdell told them. When the DNA evidence showed the Mormon faith was false, the defenders went on the attack against science and him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After coming out of the closet in a personal piece written by him detailing his deconversion, one criticism levelled at him was that he only had “witnessed the sinfulness of man and mistakenly mixed that up with a perfect God.” Lobdell writes, "I understand that argument but I don’t buy it. If the Lord is real, it would make sense for the people of God, on average, to be superior morally and ethically to the rest of society. Statistically, they aren’t. I also believe that God’s institutions, on average, should function on a higher moral plain than government or corporations. I don’t see any evidence of this. It’s hard to believe in God when it’s impossible to tell the difference between His people and atheists.” (p. 271).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We see Lobdell struggling, really struggling, to maintain his faith in the midst of his reporting. He attended a weekend retreat. He had an email exchange with a good friend and pastor. He looked into studies of prayer to find evidence that prayer works. He did a study to find if believers are any better morally than non-believers. All to no avail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a very good book written by a credible person. While I doubt believers entrenched in their faith will be caused to lose their religion from reading it, Lobdell still stands as a credible witness against religion and the mental gymnastics of believers who simply choose to believe against the evidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This small study sparked a huge controversy - Wakefield used it to claim that the MMR (mumps measles and rubella) vaccine caused autism. As a result compliance with the MMR dropped from 92% in the UK down to 85%, and measles cases soared from only 58 cases in 1998 to 1,348 cases in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that Wakefields paper has been thoroughly discredited, and subsequent studies showed convincingly that there is a lack of association between MMR or vaccines in general and autism, the controversy sparked by Wakefield continues. It has spread to the US as well, where measles cases are also starting to jump. The existing anti-vaccine movement latched onto Wakefield’s study and have been running with the vaccines-cause-autism fear-mongering ever since. While not letting go of MMR, they did shift over to thimerosal (which was never in the MMR vaccine), which has also been cleared from any association with autism (but was removed from vaccines in the US and most countries anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real story of MMR, thimerosal, vaccines, and autism is a scientific one, and the science has spoken. While further research is always welcome (as long as it is ethical) the question is essentially settled - vaccines do not cause autism. The scientific evidence does not care for the personal saga of Andrew Wakefield, but he has never-the-less become a central figure in this story. He has now been elevated to the status of folk-hero by the antivaccinationists. So while I consider Wakefield a footnote, his story is interesting and instructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigative journalist Brian Deer has been almost single-handedly responsible for digging up and exposing the sordid details of Wakefields dubious behavior. Over the weekend &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Deer published yet another expose on Wakefield &lt;/a&gt;in the TimesOnline - this time presenting evidence that Wakefield actually faked some of his data. He reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our investigation, confirmed by evidence presented to the General Medical Council (GMC), reveals that: In most of the 12 cases, the children’s ailments as described in The Lancet were different from their hospital and GP records. Although the research paper claimed that problems came on within days of the jab, in only one case did medical records suggest this was true, and in many of the cases medical concerns had been raised before the children were vaccinated. Hospital pathologists, looking for inflammatory bowel disease, reported in the majority of cases that the gut was normal. This was then reviewed and the Lancet paper showed them as abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true this is extremely damning.  What it would mean is that Wakefield either deliberately faked data, or he is such a sloppy researcher that he manipulated data to suit his biases. Confirmation bias, cherry picking, and creative interpretation can occur to manipulate data without being conscious that one is out-and-out lying. The difference hardly matters as far as scientific ethics are concerned - a researcher is responsible for the integrity of their data, and in supposed to take care that data is not fake, whether it was deliberate or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield, of course, denies the allegations - which does not tell us if he believes he is guilty or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Deer documents many other damning allegations on &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm"&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;.  For example, Wakefiled applied to patents on a supposedly improved and safer MMR vaccine the year before he published his fateful study. Therefore he had a vested interest in calling the safety of the MMR vaccine into question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wakefield’s “theory” of autism was that the MMR vaccine caused inflammatory bowel disease which allowed proteins from the vaccine to gain access to the nervous system, causing autism. He therefore argued that by treating measles infection autism could be helped or even cured. He and the Royal Free Hospital with which he partnered stood to profit from their treatment regimen for autism which targeted measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, it is alleged that the hospital’s lab used improper PCR technique in detecting measles RNA in autistic children.  A later study failed to replicate their results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Wakefield’s co-authors withdrew their names from the paper and the Lancet has issued a retraction. However, the damage to public perception had already been done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more - check out &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm"&gt;Deer’s site&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several things that are clear at this point. All of this is irrelevant to the scientific evidence, which confidently points to the conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. Every aspect of Wakefield’s research has been thoroughly discredited. The study was terrible science, faked or not. Wakefield himself is a very dubious character, and in fact in under investigation for professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also clear from past history that this new revelation will not change the minds of the hard-core antivaccinationists. To them all evidence against Wakefield or his research is just part of the Big Pharma and government conspiracy against him, further elevating his status as a folk-hero and possibly martyr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hopefully each new such revelation, and each new piece of scientific evidence supporting vaccine safety, can futher marginalize the very dangerous antivaccinationist quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

Several emailers and commenters (some comments are now deleted) saw that I had repeated the BBC's claims that it had sought a "sincere and fulsome" apology from Carol Thatcher, and instantly wrote comments insisting that this was a gross mistake (on my part, some thought; I have now put in the quotation marks that I should not have risked leaving out), since &lt;i&gt;fulsome&lt;/i&gt; doesn't mean anything like "full" but is in fact close to being an antonym of &lt;i&gt;sincere&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't seem to look anything up before they leap to the comments box.  (See Mark Liberman's documentations of astonishing earlier cases of ill-informed objections &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000263.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/000437.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and similar remarks of mine on grammatical usage &lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/001461.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/003239.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) The original senses of &lt;i&gt;fulsome&lt;/i&gt; are, according to &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fulsome"&gt;Webster&lt;/a&gt; (which is a constantly updated and extremely reliable dictionary of American English available online):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 a&lt;/b&gt; copious or abundant;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 b&lt;/b&gt; generous in amount or spirit;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;1 c&lt;/b&gt; full and well developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the BBC intended one or more of these senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has given rise to controversy is that a second sense emerged subsequently: &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; offensive (aesthetically or morally).  And more recently, two closely related other meanings arose: &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exceeding the bounds of good taste ("the fulsome chromium glitter of the escalators dominating the central hall" [Lewis Mumford]), and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; excessively complimentary or flattering ("an admiration whose extent I did not express, lest I be thought fulsome" [A. J. Liebling]).  It is the last of these that leads some readers to think that a fulsome apology could not possibly be sincere, so the BBC were asking for something impossible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As often in such cases, Merriam-Webster has appended an excellent usage note to the dictionary entry online.  It says:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The senses shown above are the chief living senses of &lt;i&gt;fulsome&lt;/i&gt;. Sense 2, which was a generalized term of disparagement in the late 17th century, is the least common of these. &lt;i&gt;Fulsome&lt;/i&gt; became a point of dispute when sense 1, thought to be obsolete in the 19th century, began to be revived in the 20th. The dispute was exacerbated by the fact that the large dictionaries of the first half of the century missed the beginnings of the revival. Sense 1 has not only been revived but has spread in its application and continues to do so. The chief danger for the user of &lt;i&gt;fulsome&lt;/i&gt; is ambiguity. Unless the context is made very clear, the reader or hearer cannot be sure whether such an expression as "fulsome praise" is meant in sense 1b or in sense 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the BBC's case, you &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; tell, so there is no ambiguity: sense 4 would give you a contradiction, and it isn't reasonable to think they wanted to contradict themselves, so obviously they meant one of the senses in 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look before you leap, guys.  When a word sense error looks so blatantly ready for a Gotcha that you can hardly believe your luck, sometimes it's because you didn't read all of the dictionary entry.  Or didn't look in a dictionary at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Sonny Boy---Solomon is his given name---is the fourth son of Sonia Kurisu, the novel's protagonist and first-person narrator. Sonia is in her twenties at the time the novel starts and living in Las Vegas, where she works as a lounge singer while trying to finish her degree in fine arts at the university. She's far from home, which is Hawaii and, specifically, Hilo, and haunted by many ghosts who draw her back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about how Yamanaka uses language to create her characters, Sonny Boy and Sonia, I've also been thinking about how the language we use in less literary contexts---in everyday writing about autism---can shape our understanding of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Liz Ditz at &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/11-years-on-wakefield-manufactured-data-showing-mmrautism-link.html"&gt;I Speak of Dreams&lt;/a&gt; has noted, quite a few people have been commenting on the discovery that &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/manipulated_data_behind_mmr-autism_controversy"&gt;data in the 1998 study on the MMR and autism were altered&lt;/a&gt;. What stands out to me is what the medical records reveal about the "regression" that the children in the study are said to have experienced. As noted in Sunday's &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;Times of London&lt;/a&gt;, developmental and other delays were noted in many of the children prior to them receiving the MMR vaccine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Emphases in this admittedly long quotation from the &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Times of London&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt; are mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first [inconsistency], in the Lancet tables, concerned the first child in the paper: Child One, from Cottesmore, Leicestershire. He was 3½ years old and the son of an air force pilot. In November 1995, his parents had been devastated after receiving a diagnosis of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mr and Mrs [One]’s most recent concern is that the MMR vaccination given to their son may be responsible,” their GP told the hospital in a letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper this claim would be adopted, with Wakefield and his team reporting that Child One’s parents said “behavioural symptoms” &lt;em&gt;started “one week” after he received the MMR&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The boy’s medical records reveal a subtly different story&lt;/em&gt;, one familiar to mothers and fathers of autistic children. &lt;em&gt;At the age of 9½ months, 10 weeks before his jab&lt;/em&gt;, his mother had become worried that he did not hear properly: the classic first symptom presented by sufferers of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child One was among the eight reported with the apparent sudden onset of the condition. So was the next child to be admitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Child Two, an eight-year-old boy from Peter-borough, Cambridgeshire, diagnosed with regressive autism, which, according to the Lancet paper, started “two weeks” after his jab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, this child’s medical records, backed by numerous specialist assessments, said his problems began three to five months later&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between 14 days and a few months is significant, according to experts. Autism usually reveals itself in the second year of life, when the vaccine is routinely given. If there was no sudden onset after the MMR injection, as claimed for the “syndrome”, the condition could be ascribed to a conventional pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More apparent anomalies lurked among the following 10 children, as they arrived at the Royal Free hospital between September 1996 and February 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one was a girl, Child Eight, aged 3, from Whitley Bay, Tyne &amp;amp; Wear. She was reported in the journal as having suffered a brain injury “two weeks” after MMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her medical records did not support this. &lt;em&gt;Before she was admitted&lt;/em&gt;, she had been seen by local specialists, and her GP told the Royal Free of “&lt;em&gt;significant concerns about her development some months before she had her MMR&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child Six, aged 5, and Child Seven, aged 3, were said to have been diagnosed with regressive autism, with an onset of symptoms “one week” and “24 hours” after the jab respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;medical records show that neither boy was “previously normal”&lt;/em&gt;, as the Lancet article described all the children, and that both had &lt;em&gt;already been hospitalised with brain problems before their MMR&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child Six received his vaccine at the age of 14 months, but had &lt;em&gt;twice previously been admitted&lt;/em&gt; with fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child Seven was given his at the age of 20 months but, again, problems already showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He developed well, had social smiling and was responsive to his mother,” a psychiatrist wrote. “But he&lt;em&gt; began to have pale episodes and ? [sic] petit mal [convulsions], and had an EEG [an electroencephalogram, a common test for epilepsy] done at 15 months, which was abnormal&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, neither was diagnosed with regressive autism, or even nonregressive classical autism. &lt;em&gt;Three of the children had been diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder&lt;/em&gt;, in which language is not lost, and which is not regressive: nothing like what afflicted One and Two. This was also the diagnosis for Child Twelve in the series, a six-year-old boy from Burgess Hill, West Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Seven would be diagnosed with an odd behavioural condition called “pathological demand avoidance syndrome”. This usually manifests as social manipulativeness, and is nothing like the “syndrome” being claimed. It is sometimes marked by a child putting his hands on his ears, while singing “lah-lah-lah, can’t hear you”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounts of a child changing "suddenly" and "overnight" are regularly given by people claiming that vaccines or something in vaccines "caused" a child to become autistic.  Such claims are not surprising: Parents aren't saying that they think a vaccine or something in a vaccine "causes" their child to "become" autistic out of the blue. But looking closer at cases like those of the children in the 1998 &lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/"&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt; study reveals a pattern, of a claim of "regressive autism" after a child received a vaccine when, in fact, the child had already presented with developmental delays, signs of epilepsy or seizures, or other concerns. For instance, in the Autism Omnibus "&lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/vaccine-court-day-1/"&gt;vaccine court&lt;/a&gt;" hearing in June 2007 for then 12-year-old Michelle Cedillo, &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/you-know-what-this-meansvaccine-court-again/#comment-380761"&gt;videotapes&lt;/a&gt; showed that she had already been showing signs of delayed and/or unusual development &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to receiving her vaccines. (A transcript from the most recent Autism Omnibus trial can be read &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1011"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora's and my first action on this sight----&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/promote_respectful_language"&gt;Promote Respectful Language&lt;/a&gt;---asked people to think at least twice about the language they use when talking about autism and when talking to individuals on the autism spectrum.  One reason that the alleged "link" of vaccines to autism is turning out to be so detrimental is that this hypothesis of autism causation suggests that having autism means an individual is "damaged" or has been "injured," or even "poisoned"; that autism is something that an individual can "get." Autism, it's implied, is analogous to some sort of external agent, some thing "outside" a child, that somehow "gets into" him or her and "makes" him or her "become" autistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hence the need to look carefully, as Brian Deer and &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/11-years-on-wakefield-manufactured-data-showing-mmrautism-link.html"&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt; are, at what's been said about what causes autism, and what autism is.&lt;/p&gt;

They included one in that credulous repository of all things antivaccine &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; (no, this isn’t about vaccines, but I can’t resist pointing out at every turn the antivaccine slant of that rather famous political blog) and in the &lt;a href="http://www.wsj.com"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. The first, published in HuffPo and written by Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil, and Rustum Roy, was entitled Leaving the Sinking Ship, while the second added Dean Ornish to its team, switched from the highly liberal venue of hte previous article to the conservative WSJ, and was entitled &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123146318996466585.html"&gt;“Alternative” Medicine Is Mainstream: The evidence is mounting that diet and lifestyle are the best cures for our worst afflictions&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, advocates of unscientific and even pseudoscientific faith-based medical treatments seemingly covered the entire span of political thought, from highly liberal to highly conservative, with their message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That message, as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=336"&gt;I have argued&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=119"&gt;Wally Sampson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=356"&gt;Kimball Atwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=339"&gt;Val Jones&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=348"&gt;Peter Lipson&lt;/a&gt;, is, to boil it down to its essence, this: The new Obama Administration has promised to make health care reform one of its top priorities, and CAM/IM advocates want to take advantage of this movement for reform as the “foot in the door” behind which they try to muscle their way in to be treated by the government as co-equal with established, science- and evidence-based medicine. How do they plan on doing this? As I &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=336"&gt;have discussed before&lt;/a&gt;, they plan on doing this by coopting disease “prevention” strategies as being CAM/IM and using them as a Trojan horse. When the government brings the giant wooden horse into the fortress of government health care, along with the bona fide prevention strategies of diet and exercise a whole lot of woo will jump out of the belly of that horse and open the fortress doors to let in its comrades. Indeed, the same strategy can be seen in how CAM/IM advocates have &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=350"&gt;coopted the Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; with a joint conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, because CAM/IM advocates have succeeded so well in tying the perfectly acceptable science- and evidence-based modalities of diet and exercise, as well as ghettoizing the respected pharmacology discipline of &lt;a href="http://www.phcog.org/definition.html"&gt;pharmacognosy&lt;/a&gt; by associating it with herbalism and, in essence, bringing it under the CAM umbrella, where it became unfairly and incorrectly tainted with its association with all the other woo that falls under the CAM/IM mantle, they expect that renewing an emphasis on diet and exercise &lt;em&gt;by their definition and on their terms&lt;/em&gt; will lead to the opening of the door into the promised land of having their modalities be funded by the government. It’s a very conscious strategy, which is why Chopra et al’s articles so clearly tried to convince readers that diet and exercise are CAM/IM. Unfortunately, that they are able to do this with such success is in part because science- and evidence-based practitioners arguably underemphasize such health prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned of another salvo fired off by CAM/IM advocates through my somehow finding myself on the mailing list for The Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. family of medical journals. Unfortunately, one of the journals published by the Liebert group is the &lt;a href="http://www.liebertpub.com/products/product.aspx?pid=26"&gt;Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. This particular e-mail was advertising an editorial written by a chiropractor named Daniel Redwood that spells out in the most detailed manner exactly how CAM/IM advocates plan on hijacking any health care reform that the Obama Administration might come up in order to persuade the government to fund what Wally frequently terms “sectarian medicine” and I simply like to call unscientific. The editorial is freely available to all (unlike the contents of JACM) and entitled &lt;a href="http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/acm.2009.0012?cookieSet=1"&gt;Alternative and Complementary Medicine Should Have Role in New Era of Health Care Reform&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about as blatant a description of the goals of the CAM/IM movement as I have ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redwood lays it on the line right from the beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in 15 years, a major national health reform initiative is moving forward in the United States. Those of us who recall the events of 1993–1994, when the Clinton administration failed to pass its version of coverage for all, know that numerous pitfalls lie ahead with the potential to undermine the best-laid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for those of us who have seen the widespread and needless suffering caused by the dominant role of money in American health care, President Barack Obama’s clear commitment to change gives much cause for optimism. Currently, tens of millions of uninsured Americans lack adequate access to quality health services and uncounted millions more delay or decline needed care for financial reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I perceive in this article, along with the same coopting of diet, exercise, and prevention strategies as being somehow “alternative,” is something different than what I have seen before. As you will see, Redwood will argue that CAM/IM is necessary in order to bring about universal health care. More on that later. In the meantime, Redwood makes divides his article into four issues: universal coverage; prevention and health promotion; chiropractic; and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). I will not discuss the first very much because, quite frankly, the issue of universal coverage is a political and moral issue over which reasonable people may disagree. I’ve &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=350#comment-12561"&gt;made my position plain before on this blog&lt;/a&gt;, and repeating that position would be tangential to my point here. That leaves points #2 through #4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the classic “bait and switch” (as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=156"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=345"&gt;I put it&lt;/a&gt;) of alternative medicine, except that in this case Redwood coopts “prevention,” bringing it into the CAM/IM cause:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that if every primary care medical physician in the nation delivered all preventive health services recommended for every patient by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, these physicians would have no time for anything else.1 There would be no time for other patient care, no record keeping, no time for continuing education, and no time for creative thinking. Therefore, simple mathematics dictates that either preventive services recommendations must be drastically scaled back (precisely the opposite of what policy analysts from left, right, and center are proposing) or other delivery channels must be developed. Any meaningful prevention and health promotion plan must mobilize the efforts of other health providers (nurses, physician’s assistants, chiropractors, naturopaths, acupuncturists, and others) for these preventive services, consistent with these practitioners’ training and licensure. Like medical physicians, however, these other providers have additional responsibilities. Enlisting their help is necessary but far from sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new prevention and health promotion infrastructure must be developed as well, along the lines of the Samueli Institute’s (Alexandria, VA) superbly crafted Wellness Initiative for the Nation (WIN), which proposes implementation of new policies to “establish standards in comprehensive lifestyle and integrated health care approaches, and train individuals with qualifications to focus full-time on prevention.” A new cadre of Health and Wellness Coaches is envisioned to fill the gaping holes in our current prevention and health promotion infrastructure. Also included in the WIN model are “specialist certification for health professionals in prevention, health and wellness delivery in specific settings and populations—for example, schools, worksites, the military, health care settings, and long-term care facilities,” and creating “a Health Corps to provide an army of young and older people that would learn and model wellness behavior and support delivery of wellness education and training by the coaches.” The current draft of WIN—at www.siib.org—should be read by everyone seeking to understand the transformative potential of the health reform moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I mean? To Redwood, if we don’t have enough resources in primary care to do the preventative care that science- and evidence-based medicine considers important, the answer isn’t to add to the number of primary care doctors by somehow incentivizing medical students to enter primary care specialties rather than the more lucrative procedure-based specialties. Oh, no. Rather, it’s to bring in the woo by enlisting naturopaths, acupuncturists, and unspecified others. Also notice how Redwood conflates perfectly good and valuable science-based practitioners like nurses and physician’s assistants with practitioners of unscientific medicine like acupuncturists and naturopaths. Let me tell you, if I were a nurse or a PA, I’d be insulted. I’d be royally pissed off. Nurses and PAs are every bit as valuable as physicians in delivering science- and evidence-based health care. Indeed, expanding the roles of advanced practice nurses and other “physician extenders” like PAs may well be one way to alleviate this problem, but to conflate PAs and APNs with naturopaths and acupuncturists is a grave insult. At least, I’d view it as an insult if I belonged to one of those professions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the &lt;a href="http://www.siib.org/news/446-SIIB/version/default/part/AttachmentData/data/WIN%20Summary%20Draft%2022dec08.pdf"&gt;Samueli Institute WIN initiative&lt;/a&gt;, suffice it to say that it’s another excellent example of the coopting of diet, exercise, and lifestyle interventions for purposes of a back door “Trojan horse” introduction of all manners of woo as services reimbursable by any new “reformed” government health care sytem. A lot of what’s in WIN is hard to argue with. It’s stuff like teaching healthy eating habits to children, encouraging exercise, and providing interactions to prevent chronic disease. However, some passages reveal the true colors of this initiative. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Central to a new model of prevention and health care are the development of “optimal healing environments” and “integrated health care practices” 20 that can support and stimulate inherent healing capacities on mental, social, spiritual and physical levels. As described below, many of these practices provide lower cost alternatives to current conventional practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The widespread application of selected, evidence‐based integrated health care practices could markedly improve quality of life and reduce costs. Behavioral and mindbody practices have been repeatedly demonstrated to enhance quality of life, improve self‐care and reduce costs. 51 Acupuncture has now been definitively shown to improve chronic pain conditions (head, neck, knee and back) at almost twice the rate of guideline‐based conventional treatment. Massage may be even more cost effective in back pain. Massage has also been shown in multiple studies to accelerate recovery of premature babies, with projected cost savings of $4.7 billion per year if widely used. Training retired persons to deliver this infant massage results in reduced depression and enhanced quality of life in those giving the massage – a double benefit. Since under current policies, these practices are not profitable, they remain underutilized at the expense of higher cost and more heroic treatment approaches. A properly focused wellness policy would change this situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, readers of this blog should know by now that acupuncture is nothing more than an elaborate placebo, perhaps with some counterirritant activity. Just peruse our &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?cat=8"&gt;articles on the topic&lt;/a&gt; for copious discussions of the matter, particularly Harriet Hall’s masterful debunking of the “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=252"&gt;acupuncture myth&lt;/a&gt;.” I also note that the article cited for the claim that massage accelerates recovery of premature infants is from 1993. A &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15106151?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=4&amp;amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;Cochrane review of the evidence from 2003&lt;/a&gt; concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence that massage for preterm infants is of benefit for developmental outcomes is weak and does not warrant wider use of preterm infant massage. Where massage is currently provided by nurses, consideration should be given as to whether this is a cost-effective use of time. Future research should assess the effects of massage interventions on clinical outcome measures, such as medical complications or length of stay, and on process-of-care outcomes, such as care-giver or parental satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, even if massage did improve outcomes in preterm infants, there’s nothing about massage that is “alternative.” If science shows that massage improves outcomes in such infants, then massage is a science-based medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Redwood gets to the meat of the matter. He argues for full inclusion of chiropractic as being the equivalent to science- and evidence-based medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it [chiropractic] is specifically recognized as essential in the core benefits package of the emerging health reform plan may prove to be a bellwether (along with lifestyle-based prevention) as to the extent to which genuine, paradigm-shifting change is embodied in the Obama program. Chiropractors (D.C.s) and their 22 million patients in the United States were quite heartened when Obama sent three separate letters of support to the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) during the presidential campaign. Most encouraging was the fact that Obama, the eventual winner, was the only presidential candidate in either party to specifically respond to the ACA’s detailed candidate questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from inclusion in a core benefit package, arguably the most critical goal for chiropractors (and other non-M.D. practitioners), is to codify in federal law a policy of nondiscrimination among types of providers, for both coverage and reimbursement. In other words, if spinal manipulation (or massage, physical rehabilitation, nutritional counseling, mindfulness meditation instruction, or any other procedure) is covered when performed by a medical or osteopathic physician, then it must always be covered at the same rate of reimbursement for any health practitioner licensed to provide it. Freedom of choice among providers and a level playing field on coverage and reimbursement are ideas whose time has hopefully arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how Redwood equates the inclusion of chiropractic as a reimbursable health care modality with “paradigm-shifting change.” Of course, he’s right. It would be paradigm-shifting. Unfortunately, it would be paradigm-shifting in the wrong direction, namely away from science-based practice and towards and towards unscientific modalities. That’s exactly what we who support science-based medicine are afraid of. Also note the false dichotomy that Redwood posits. To him, it’s either necessary to include chiropractic, or health care “reform” is not sufficiently embracing “wellness” inititatives and thus, to him at least, a failure. I would counter that including chiropractic, at least the flavors of chiropractic that embrace the pseudoscientific concept of “subluxations,” would be a waste of money and would actually detract from health care reform. To me, any health care reform that does not reward the practice of science-based medicine and discourage the use of unscientific health care modaliteis based on prescientific thinking (such as reiki, homeopathy, various “energy” therapies) or pseudoscientific concepts (such as subluxations) will be no “reform” at all. As we on this blog have argued time and time again, “integrating” pseudoscience with scientific medicine adds nothing to scientific medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t tell that to Redwood. He sees great strength in woo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAM’s contributions to health reform should grow organically from its areas of greatest strength. Foremost among these is the principled and pragmatic insistence that health be understood holistically, as a summation of various lifeaffirming inputs and not the mere absence of symptoms. The key corollary—still not sufficiently accepted by conventional medicine—is that, while single-intervention “silver bullet” therapies may dramatically eliminate symptoms (sometimes in life-saving ways), these therapies alone are not the road to long-term, sustainable health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, perhaps the most important policy change relevant to CAM would be to shift both CAM and conventional health research budgets away from the longstanding emphasis on single intervention therapeutics and toward multifactorial integrative and whole-systems approaches. (The Ornish lifestyle program that proved heart disease could be reversed through a combination of diet, exercise, stress management, and social support provides the best model for this approach.) Whether for heart disease, low-back pain, prostate cancer, or any other condition, NIH policies that funnel virtually all health research funds to single-agent (usually pharmaceutical) studies have led us into a cul-de-sac of historic proportions. This research strategy may have been effective for combating many infectious diseases, but it has proven far less applicable to the chronic diseases—cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, arthritis, osteoporosis, and others—that are the bane of the developed world. CAM can play a helpful role in finding a way forward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, note the same old trope about CAM/IM as somehow “holistically” understanding health and disease. This is utter tripe. If you look at CAM/IM modalities, you’ll find that many of them reduce all disease down to a single cause. For instance, if you are Hulda Clark, you see all disease as being caused by a liver fluke, and the cure for cancer, AIDS, and all diseases is to “zap” that liver fluke. If you are an acupuncturist, you see all disease as being caused by imbalances in the flow of some mystical life energy (&lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;), and the cure is to stick needles in various parts of the anatomy unrelated to any anatomic structures in order to “redirect” that flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;. Another example is the alt-med obsession with “contamination” and “toxins,” for which the answer is always “detoxification.” One example is the manner in which so many disparate maladies of highly different pathophysiology in CAM/IM are attributed to “heavy metal toxicity,” for which the treatment is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; some form of chelation therapy. When CAM/IM advocates claim that CAM/IM modalities look at the “real cause” of disease as opposed to “just treating the symptoms,” it’s a load of fetid dingo’s kidneys. In reality, science-based medicine uses science to identify at the cellular and molecular level how the body goes wrong and what can be done to fix it. In contrast, CAM/IM just waves its hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a false dichotomy here that I get sick of seeing. To Redwood, there appear to be only two choices. Either we study only “single-agent” studies or we embrace all manner of pseudoscientific woo. There are two problems with this (at least). Even if it were true, the answer to “too narrow” research is not to embrace pseudoscience as co-equal to science in medicine or to “integrate” quackery with scientific medicine. It is to broaden the scope of scientific reasearch, to embrace new science-based approaches that look at more variables. Of course, the second thing that’s wrong with Redwood’s critique is that science has been evolving to looking at more multifactorial causes of disease as technology, such as genomics and proteomics, allows scientists to look at changes in the expression of every gene in the genome and at hundreds of proteins at once. There’s no need to invoke &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;, imbalances of humors, multiple “toxins,” or any other woo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Redwood puts the cart before the horse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other issue of great importance for both CAM and the rest of the health care Moreover, all practitioners of all types must become conversant with the full range of health care approaches (both conventional and CAM) available in the U.S. health care system. This does not mean that medical internists must themselves deliver spinal manipulation, acupuncture, or massage treatments; it means that such internists need to know what these therapies involve and where evidence supports their appropriate use. When those circumstances arise, referrals should be made. This is a two-way street; CAM practitioners must also be well-informed about the biomedical options available to patients in order to make appropriate referrals, and must not hesitate to do so. It must never be considered acceptable for either conventional or CAM practitioners to be ignorant of what other health care approaches have to offer. Wide-ranging knowledge and mutual respect must be our watchwords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, let me repeat what I have said time and time again: The concept of alternative medicine (or CAM or IM) is a false dichotomy. There is no such thing as “alternative” medicine. There is either medicine that has been shown scientifically to work; medicine that has not; and medicine that has been shown not to work. Nearly all of CAM falls into one of the latter two categories. Moreover, when an “alternative” therapy is validated through scientific study and shown to work, it ceases to be “alternative” and becomes just medicine. I do, however, agree somewhat that conventional practitioners should know a bit about CAM in that various CAM remedies can interact with science-based medications, either increasing or decreasing their activities or side effects. It’s necessary to train physicians to know just which CAM modalities can interfere with science-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Redwood sees grave–even apocalyptic–consequences if CAM is rejected in any health care reform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current health reform initiative is a high-impact event for all concerned. Failure by Congress and the Obama administration to enact universal coverage now would be likely to doom such efforts for a generation. Failure to properly fund and prioritize lifestyle-based prevention methods would more deeply entrench a status quo that has already proven woefully inadequate at serving society’s health needs. Failure to institute a level playing field among the professions would be tantamount to an endorsement of ongoing injustice. Excluding established professions that provide essential services from a national core benefit plan would mark a major step backward. Make no mistake—a very real possibility of disaster on many levels lurks in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the political question of universal coverage, note how Redwood conflates “lifestyle-based prevention methods” with CAM/IM and characterizes not embracing such methods as “entrenching a status quo.” Of course, this is again an example of the “bait and switch,” where diet and lifestyle interventions are the bait and the switch is all the other pseudoscientific nonsense that comes along with CAM. Also note how Redwood invokes the ever-popular “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=287"&gt;health care freedom&lt;/a&gt;” canard so beloved of quacks and charlatans, painting failure to include CAM/IM as part of health care reform as a grave injustice and saying that a “level playing field” is necessary. Unfortunately for Redwood, this “health care freedom” does not represent freedom for patients at all but rather the freedom of quacks and charlatans to do whatever they want, free from any pesky interference from government regulatory agencies or state medical boards, and the “level playing field” he envisions is in reality spotting CAM/IM three touchdowns before the game even begins. Or, to mix metaphors, CAM/IM wants to be placed on third base and then call it a home run if it gets to tag up and go home on the basis of a fly ball out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If CAM/IM had compelling science and evidence behind it, it would not be trying to manipulate the political process to give itself an unfair advantage, while whining that it is so persecuted. Unfortunately, with the backing of the Bravewell Collaborative, the Samueli Institute, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, advocates of CAM/IM are in a strong position to insert themselves into the upcoming political debate over health care reform. If science-based medicine is to repulse this infiltration, two things will have to happen. First, the Obama Administration’s science and medical advisors will have to be sufficiently savvy not to fall for the blandishments of sectarians and to promote science-based, not pseudoscience-based, medicine. On that score, I am cautiously optimistic. The second thing that will have to happen is that science-based physicians will have to mount an effort to influence legislators at least equal to what CAM advocates are already doing. Unfortunately, on that latter score, I am much less optimistic. Most science-based physicians are not political activists, and the power and wealth of the forces trying to insert CAM into any health care reform is potent. Still, that does not mean we shouldn’t try.&lt;/p&gt;

Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger&lt;/strong&gt;, the pilot who landed US Airways Flight 1549 safely into the Hudson River was asked by 60 minutes on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; tonight &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/08/katie-couric-interview-on_n_165022.html"&gt;if he prayed&lt;/a&gt; during the crisis. &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/08/60minutes/main4783580.shtml"&gt;His answer couldn’t have been better&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if he at any point prayed, he told Couric, “I would imagine somebody in back was taking care of that for me while I was flying the airplane.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My focus at that point was so intensely on the landing,” he said. “I thought of nothing else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of the old saying, “Two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don’t know what Sullenberger’s beliefs are but that’s besides the point. The men and women who survived that crash were saved by a human being, not some mystical god. So I’d appreciate it if they kept this “miracle” rhetoric out in respect for the man who saved these people with nothing but his wits, his training, and his ingenuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slapping on the word miracle reminds me of the ending to &lt;em&gt;Slumdog Millionare&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOILER ALERT!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what should have been the story of an underdog overcoming incredible odds and circumstances to achieve success was more or less ruined by the final moment of the film where the writer essentially pulls a Patrick-Duffy-in-the-shower move and writes off the hero of the story as having simply been fated to succeed. And while critics seem impressed by this, I feel it completely undercuts the hero’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to further illustrate how our culture has completely devalued the meaning of the word “miracle” to simply mean anything serendipidous.&lt;/p&gt;

Stephen Wise (don’t let the name fool you) has announced through &lt;a href="http://www.jacksonville.com/news/metro/2009-02-08/story/wise_to_introduce_intelligent_design_bill"&gt;an article in the Florida Times Union&lt;/a&gt; that he intends to propose a bill that would mandate the teaching of the cdesign proponentsists’ view–err, I mean “Intelligent” Design. And if the article I read is accurately describing his terminology then he is actually proposing the teaching of Intelligent Design and the more recent spin promoting  “teaching both sides.” Here’s a direct quote from Senator Wise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re going to teach evolution, then you have to teach the other side so you can have critical thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess the Senator thinks we should teach Holocaust denial too, you know, because we have to teach the other side so we can have critical thinking. And if we really want to apply Sen. Wise’s model of critical thinking then we gotta teach Flat Earth Theory too. And don’t forget David Icke’s view of history that involves the world being ruled by shape-shifting reptiles from outer space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Wise, pretending that all opinions are equally valid points of view is not teaching critical thinking but rather it’s a mockery of everything our education system stands for. But you know what? I agree that we should teach Intelligent Design in Science classrooms. Every high school student should be required to read through &lt;a href="http://www.aclupa.org/legal/legaldocket/intelligentdesigncase/dovertrialtranscripts.htm"&gt;the transcripts of the Dover Trial &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/kitzmiller_v_dover_decision.html"&gt;Judge Jones’ famous 139-page decision&lt;/a&gt; where he ruled that not only was “Intelligent” Design not science but that it could not be separated from its inherently religious roots and that its proponents are in fact LIARS.&lt;/p&gt;

I get especially grumpy about &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/02/we-are-becoming-a-new-species-we-are-becoming-homo-evolutis.ars"&gt;armchair futurists making pronouncements about biology when they don't know a thing about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman and CEO of Biotechonomy, Enriquez says that humanity is on the verge of becoming a new and utterly unique species, which he dubs &lt;i&gt;Homo Evolutis&lt;/i&gt;. What makes this species so unique is that it "takes direct and deliberate control over the evolution of the species." Calling it the "ultimate reboot," he points to the conflux of DNA manipulation and therapy, tissue generation, and robotics as making this great leap possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day may come when we are able to take the best biology of the known animal kingdom and make it part of our own. This isn't just about being a bit stronger, or having perfect eyesight our whole lives. All of our organs and limbs have weaknesses that can be addressed, and there are also opportunities to go beyond basic fixes and perform more elaborate enhancements. At a private lunch on Thursday, Enriquez spoke of a young girl who, after suffering a knee injury, received tendon replacement therapy centered around tendons grown in a lab. It not only fixed her knee, but made it stronger than normal. Later in life as she pursued life as a professional skier, he coach actually asked that she have the same surgery on her other knee to increase her abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Every&lt;/i&gt; species is new and unique. Humans have some unusual specializations, but it doesn't warrant his misplaced enthusiasm. Every species also takes control over its own evolution, in a sense; individuals make choices of all sorts that influence what will happen in the next generation. You could rightly argue that they don't do it with planning and intent, but I have seen nothing that suggests that our attempts to modify our species, low tech and high tech together, are any wiser or better informed about the long-term consequences than those of any rat fighting for an opportunity to mate. We do what we do; don't pretend it's part of a long term plan that is actually prepared for all of the unexpected eventualities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, of course, what does he talk about? Phenotypic patchwork! That isn't evolution at all. That girl's children will have whatever tendons her genetics grant them, without regard for the surgeon's tinkering. Then he has the gall to claim that this warrants the designation of a new species? Hah. I wear eyeglasses. I declare that I am a member of &lt;i&gt;Homo oculis&lt;/i&gt;! I read and communicate with text, so I'm now a member of &lt;i&gt;Homo literatus&lt;/i&gt;! I've had my appendix removed, therefore I am part of the bold vanguard of &lt;i&gt;Homo sanscecum&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Lawyers for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LBC_97.3"&gt;LBC 97.3&lt;/a&gt;, a London-based talk radio station, are learning the hard way that censorship doesn’t work on the internet, and that which was supposed to be censored is merely amplified, a phenomena known as the &lt;a href="http://www.thestreisandeffect.com/"&gt;The Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:230px"&gt;&lt;img title="jenibarnett46011" src="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/jenibarnett46011.jpg" alt="Talker Jeni Barnett of LBC 97.3" width="220" height="130"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talker Jeni Barnett of LBC 97.3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest example involves &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goldacre"&gt;Dr. Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; who writes the indispensable Bad Science blog and a weekly &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; column. Goldacre rightly trained his sites on LBC talker Jeni Barnett, a British actress who feels obligated to share what she knows about vaccines and measles. But since she knows so little, Barnet was compelled to fill the rest of her three hour time slot with anti-vaccine talking points, addle-pated &lt;em&gt;weltanschauung&lt;/em&gt;, and other assorted brain farts. In the pre-internet age such mindless drivel passed quietly into the ether, and was easily ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;ignore&lt;/em&gt;, being the root word of &lt;em&gt;ignorance&lt;/em&gt;, is not something Goldacre is comfortable with. He spends too much time exposing ignorance, and when Jeni Barnett, a former cooking show hostess, served up a steaming bouillabaisse of crass indifference to our mechanistic universe, well, Goldacre sprang into action. One of his readers kindly edited Barnett’s three-hour crankfest down to 44 minutes, and Goldacre posted the audio file on his website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBC 97.3 was not amused. &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;Goldacre explains&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;LBC’s lawyers say that the clip I posted is a clear infringement of their copyright, that I must take it down immediately, that I must inform them when I have done so, and that they “reserve their rights”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me this raises several problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I don’t even know what “reserving your rights” means. They are a large corporation worth around a billion pounds (genuinely), I am some bloke, they have a legal team, I have no money, they are making threats using technical terminology and I actually don’t understand what those words mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, more importantly, as I have  written at length, the media have systematically and irresponsibly misrepresented the evidence on MMR. It is my view that individuals like Jeni Barnett  - but more importantly, organisations like  LBC and Global Radio who give them a mouthpiece and a platform - pose a serious danger to public health, with their ignorant outbursts, disseminated to the nation. This clip was extremely instructive as an example of that recurring theme, and it deserves to be freely accessible and widely discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMR vaccine uptake has dropped from 93% to around 75%, and to below 50% in London. Furthermore, the media have shown no sign of recognising and acknowledging their role, and so it seems likely that they will go on to cause further harm on this but also, more importantly, on many other issues. I write about all this because I think it is interesting, and extremely important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thirdly, there is a question of the basic tools you need to illustrate a point. The clip I posted was, to my mind, hideous and unremitting: it went on for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact it was so long, so unrelenting, and so misinformed that I &lt;em&gt;really couldn’t express to you how hideous it was. &lt;/em&gt;If I tried, without the audio, you might think I was exaggerating. You might think that I was biased, that I was misrepresenting Jeni’s demeanour and views in this broadcast, that and their parent company are living up to the standards of basic responsibility which we might reasonably hold them to, as they shepherd Jeni’s views and explanations into our cars and kitchens. You might think that I was quoting Jeni out of context, cherry picking only the ridiculous moments from an otherwise sensible, proportionate and responsible piece of public rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldacre removed the audio from BadScience.com and,  predictably, the file instantly appeared on &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Bad_Science:_Jeni_Barnett_MMR_and_vaccination_slot_on_LBC_radio,_2009"&gt;a dozen other sites&lt;/a&gt;. There’s even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/jeni_barnett_mmr_show_-_full_t.php"&gt;a written transcript&lt;/a&gt;. Highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB&lt;/strong&gt;: But why give them the vaccine if they get the measles? I never can understand that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical MD caller&lt;/strong&gt;: We don’t give vaccines to children who have had measles. They need a combined vaccine of measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they have one dose the studies show that they possibly need to be revaccinated within a couple of years to make sure that that protection carries on for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;*  *  *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m going to ask you something here, have you had the flu jab? And still you’ve got the cold?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sneezing physician caller:&lt;/strong&gt; The vaccine protects you from influenza. It doesn’t protect you from the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB stream of -consciousness: &lt;/strong&gt;Back in the day, children got measles, children got mumps. I’m not suggesting - I am not suggesting - that we got backwards where some children, where we have one in fifteen children die of it&lt;em&gt; (then a minute later) &lt;/em&gt;What is wrong with childhood illnesses? Is it - to hark back to the first hour - because we don’t have parents at home looking after the children? What’s going on? Is there something wrong with having mumps, is there something - you know is it - most people aren’t that one in fifteen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, however, have talked to many people over the years - 22 years I’ve lived with my daughter - and over the years many many people have said the same thing, that when we were little, chicken pox, you took your kid to get the chickenpox, you made sure your child was near somebody who had it. My brother got mumps,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;he lived to tell the tale. I don’t know if we had measles. I was sitting next to Nick Owen on the settee at TV AM when his children were incubating rubella which is measles, and I was pregnant!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnett’s recurring themes, as Goldacre called them, are not unique to LBC 97.3. Such gross distortions of  science and reason are the fruit some faulty, but &lt;a href="http://klausler.com/cargo.html"&gt;widely held assumptions&lt;/a&gt;* held by the news and entertainment media. A few include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complicated answers are suspect.&lt;/em&gt; Antigens-schmantigens, just give it to us straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certainty is strength. Doubt is weakness.&lt;/em&gt; Nothing cements certainty like personal experience, confirmed by anecdotes on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your opinion matters as much as anyone else’s.&lt;/em&gt; Of course you’re biased, but so is everyone else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If it’s good for you, it’s good.&lt;/em&gt; Better to bark like a loon than run with the herd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio personalities such as Jeni Barnett are a symptom of a much larger problem - the dumbing down of the consumer population. As news and entertainment media meld into a single, amorphous glob, the line between science and wishful thinking becomes hazier. Exposing Barnett and LBC 97.3 is a little like putting on a pair of reading glasses - it helps us to see the line more clearly, and perhaps recognize our own biases and misperceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the recent resurgence of this debate, sparked by the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/rachiesyd"&gt;ramblings of LBCs 97.3FM’s Jeni Barnett&lt;/a&gt; last week, I thought it appropriate to make you aware of the “&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15016483?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus"&gt;retraction of interpretation&lt;/a&gt;” published in the Lancet in 2004 and written by 10 of the 12 authors of the original paper. This includes Murch and Walker-Smith who, along with Wakefield, are currently being investigated by the General Medical Council of the UK for serious professional misconduct relating to the Lancet publication. Conspicuous by his absence from this retraction is Dr Wakefield. The authors explain that they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“wish to make it clear, that in this paper no causal link was established between the MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire retraction is reproduced below, please click on the image to see it in high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:479px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/entire-retraction.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="entire-retraction" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/entire-retraction-300x178.jpg" alt="Lancet, 2004 Mar 6;363(9411):750." width="469" height="277"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lancet, 2004 Mar 6;363(9411):750.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasise this was published in 2004. Almost &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIVE &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;years ago. Yet the anti-vaccers, including the likes of the toxic Jeni Barnett still insist there is a link between MMR and autism. Just to make sure I didn’t get it wrong, here is the important part, enlarged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/mmr-retraction.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="mmr-retraction" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/mmr-retraction-300x107.jpg" alt="" width="482" height="171"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems pretty clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is this debate still on-going? If the authors have admitted they may have got the interpretation of their own data wrong, why is it the anti-vacc crowd think they know better?&lt;br&gt;
And when will they realise the Wakefield paper was &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; a definitive finding on MMR and autism?&lt;br&gt;
Especially when you look at the &lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/2009/02/08/allegations-that-andrew-wakefield-faked-the-data-in-his-lancet-paper/"&gt;conflict of interest issues &lt;/a&gt;also clouding this publication which constitutes part of the reason why Wakefield is currently being investigated for serious professional misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the anti-vacc crowd it seems like this might be a case of Saunders’* law in action;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The more bizzare the premise, the more entrenched the belief.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was published on February 8, 2009, in the Times of London:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by
Brian Deer
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
THE doctor who sparked the scare over the safety of the MMR vaccine for children changed and misreported results in his research, creating the appearance of a possible link with autism, a Sunday Times investigation has found.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Confidential medical documents and interviews with witnesses have established that Andrew Wakefield manipulated patients’ data, which triggered fears that the MMR triple vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella was linked to the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Response from the anti-vax crowd at Age of Autism? They are surely impervious to evidence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have read Brian Deer&amp;#39;s myopic and sick articles before and this
ranks as a prime example of the disgusting lows he will go to as a
freak show &amp;quot;freelance writer.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How the Sunday Times can actually print this as news, as true facts is
just baffling and shows the lengths that these horrible human beings
will go to. How he got the confidential information to salivate about
and change to his liking so he could twist the words around and make
his fantasy Wakefield story appear is truly crazy and more than likely
illegal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People want this science to go away and it&amp;#39;s not ever going away so
the witch hunt continues. Deer is not a bulldog but more like a
parasite. He is living off the pain and suffering of our children and
he needs to be exposed for the slimy, sensationalistic, liar that he
is.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683687.ece"&gt;How the MMR scare led to the return of measles&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There were 1,348 cases of measles in the UK last year, according to the Health Protection Agency, up 36% from 2007. In 1998, the year that Andrew Wakefield published his research in The Lancet, there were 56 cases.

Anthony's book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Horse-Wheel-Language-Bronze-Age-Eurasian/dp/0691058873/"&gt;The Horse, the Wheel, and Language&lt;/a&gt;, and I especially appreciated his clear explanation of the complex world of Eastern European and Central Asian archaeology. There&amp;#39;s a lot of new and relevant information, but you really do need a good guide — the facts and conjectures are complex enough, but the difficulty is multiplied many fold by the evolved disciplinary nomenclature, which is sometimes so baroque as to defy parody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here's a sample passage (p. 164):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The Cucuteni-Tripolye culture occupied the frontier between Old Europe and the Pontic-Caspian cultures. More than twenty-seven hundred Cucuteni-Tripolye sites have now been discovered and examined with small excavations, and a few have been entirely excavated (figure 9.1). The Cucuteni-Tripolye culture first appeared around 5200-5000 BCE, and survived a thousand years longer than any other part of the Old European world. Tripolye people were still creating large houses and villages, advanced pottery and metals, and female figurines as late as 3000 BCE. They were the sophisticated western neighbors of the steppe people who probably spoke Proto-Indo-European.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Cucuteni-Tripolye is named after two archaeological sites: Cucuteni, discovered in eastern Romania in 1909, and Tripolye, discovered in central Ukraine in 1899. Romanian archaeologists use the name Cucuteni and Ukrainians use Tripolye, each with its own system of internal chronological divisions, so we must use cumbersome labels like Pre-Cucuteni III/Tripolye A to refer to a single prehistoric culture. There is a Borges-like dreaminess to the Cucuteni pottery sequence: one phase (Cucuteni C) is not a phase at all but rather a type of pottery probably made outside the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture; another phase (Cucuteni A1) was defined before it was found, and never was found; still another (Cucuteni A5) was created in 1963 as a challenge for future scholars, and is now largely forgotten; and the whole sequence was first defined on the assumption, later proved wrong, that the Cucuteni A phase was the oldest, so later archaeologists had to invent the Pre-Cucuteni phases I, II, and III, one of which (Pre-Cucuteni I) might not exist. The positive side of this obsession with pottery types is that the pottery is known and studied in minute detail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the cited figure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troy writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m a high school math teacher who is trying to assemble an extra-credit reading list. I want to give my students (ages 16-18) the opportunity/motivation to learn about stimulating mathematical ideas that fall outside of the curriculum I’m bound to teach. I already do this somewhat with special lessons given throughout the year, but I would like my students to explore a particular concept in depth. I am looking for books that are well-written, engaging, and accessible to someone who doesn’t have a lot of college-level mathematical training. I already have a handful of books on my list, but I want my students to be able to choose from a variety of topics. Many thanks for all suggestions!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good suggestions in the comments, and some not so good ones. Surely our wise and mathematically sophisticated readers will be able to help. Add what you can there, and in the comments here if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article5687751.ece"&gt;The deadliest bushfires in Australia's history&lt;/a&gt; have wrought death and destruction across southern Australia, killing scores of people, destroying hundreds of homes and razing entire towns to the ground.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the last count the toll had reached 108, but the thousands of firefighters still battling the blazes warned that they expected to find many more bodies when they reach the worst affected areas tomorrow.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The fires began on the hottest day ever recorded in Melbourne and were fanned by gale-force winds. Many of the dead were said to have waited too long in their homes before fleeing and were burnt alive in their cars as multiple fires tore through the countryside of Victoria state. Some of the blazes were set by arsonists. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/emergency_preparedness/"&gt;2008 was a bad year for fires in California.&lt;/a&gt;  The low rainfall levels to date promise even more burning.

$20,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the price tag for one week of behavioral treatment for 13-year-old Marissa Bilson as noted on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_long_haul_on_autism_911"&gt;CNN's 'Autism 911'&lt;/a&gt; series. The therapy was provided by &lt;a href="http://www.autismpartnership.com/"&gt;Autism Partnership&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In talking about the show with other friends who have children on the spectrum, we've all been a bit puzzled at that $20,000 figure. Certainly we've all written plenty of cheques for services for our kids, including intensive home ABA services of the sort provided by agencies like &lt;a href="http://www.autismpartnership.com/"&gt;Autism Partnership&lt;/a&gt;. But $20,000 for one week?  A year of ABA was estimated to cost $40,000 in 1999 when Charlie was just diagnosed. I don't know about just one week of therapy costing half of that, even if it's ten years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.abc4.com/mostpopular/story/New-therapy-provides-inexpensive-treatment-for/MpWjYsOWF0KulTgrg3U3Yg.cspx"&gt;ABC4&lt;/a&gt; news (Utah) report discusses &lt;a href="http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml"&gt;DIR/Floortime&lt;/a&gt; as an "inexpensive treatment" for autism. The lower cost of this therapy was particularly highlighted. Is, or should there be, a maximum to how much is charged for therapy----something below $20,000/week, I'd suggest?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in the previous essay in this series, Intelligent Design advocate &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/10/and_the_miller_told_his_tale_ken_miller_.html" rel="external "&gt;Casey Luskin&lt;/a&gt; 
doesn’t think the fusion which produced human chromosome 2 could have become fixed in the human population: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller may have found good empirical evidence for a chromosomal fusion event. But our experience with mammalian genetics tells us that such a chromosomal aberration could have created a non-viable mutant, or a normal individual who could not produce viable offspring. Thus, Neo-Darwinism has a hard time explaining why such a random fusion event was somehow advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin (and other ID/creationist apologists I’ve seen on internet discussion fora) maintain that the fusion which resulted in human chromosome 2 must have had drastic negative effects on the fertility of heterozygotes for the fusion. This reduction in fitness, they argue, would effectively prevent the propagation of the fusion throughout the population. On the surface, this sounds like an effective argument, since it is known that translocations and fusions can have such a negative effect by producing non-balanced gametes (see  PZ Myers’s  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/luskins_ludicrous_genetics.php" rel="external "&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on his blog &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" rel="external "&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for a detailed explanation). However, anyone familiar with the cytogenetic literature of mammals knows that one cannot claim that these rearrangements   greatly decrease fertility with any certainty, since there are numerous examples where such an expected reduction does not occur. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, daMota and da Silva (1998) observed centric fusions in goats that had no discernable effect on fertility: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results suggest the involvement of chromosomes 6 and 15 in the fusion demonstrated by G-banding in prometaphase cells. The Brazilian sample of animals carrying structural rearrangements did not present any reduction in fertility, suggesting the existence of prezygotic selection against unbalanced gametes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also cite several other goat studies which found the same thing. In rodents, Nachman and Myers (1989) found a similar situation in a population of marsh rats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; The observation of karyotypic uniformity in most species has led to the widespread belief that selection   limits chromosomal change. We report an unprecedented amount of chromosomal variation in a natural population of the South American marsh rat Holochlus brasiliensis. This variation consists of four distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements: whole-arm translocations, pericentric inversions, variation in the amount of euchromatin, and variation in number and kind of supernumerary (B) chromosomes. Twenty-six karyotypes are present among 42 animals. Observations of the natural population over a 7-year period and breeding experiments with captive animas indicate that heterozygous individuals suffer no detectable reduction in fitness. This is at odds with a central assumption in current models of chromosomal speciation and provides a firm rejection of the view that selection necessarily restricts chromosomal change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another study, Bardhan and Sharma (2000) studied heterozygote fertility for numerous translocations and fusions in mice, and concluded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three chromosomal species exhibit a high incidence of polymorphisms for Robertsonian fusions and pericentric inversions. Breeding experiments and histological analysis of testis show that heterozygosity for pericentric inversions and Robertsonian fusions had no effect on fertility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nachman and Myers (1989) reported similar results in marsh rats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observation of karyotypic uniformity in most species has led to the widespread belief that selection limits chromosomal change. We report an unprecedented
amount of chromosomal variation in a natural population of the South American marsh rat &lt;em&gt;Holochlus brasiliensis&lt;/em&gt;. This variation consists of four distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements: whole-arm translocations, pericentric inversions,variation in the amount of euchromatin, and variation in number and kind of supernumerary (B) chromosomes. Twenty-six karyotypes are present among 42 animals. Observations of the natural population over a 7-year period and breeding experiments with captive animals indicate that heterozygous individuals suffer no detectable reduction in fitness. This is at odds with a central assumption in current models of chromosomal speciation and provides a firm rejection of the view that selection necessarily restricts chromosomal change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in speciation are interested in the fertility effects of chromosomal rearrangements because reduced fertility in heterozygotes can be an effective barrier to gene flow between populations differing by such rearrangements.  But they have come to the conclusion that this reduced fertility is not as common as cytogenetic theory predicts. Coyne and Orr (1998) summed up the situation this way:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; A further problem with chromosomal speciation is that it depends critically on the semisterility of hybrids who are heterozygous for chromosome rearrangements. It is not widely appreciated, however, that heterozygous rearrangements theoretically expected to be deleterious (e.g. fusions and pericentric inversions) in reality often enjoy normal fitness, probably because segregation is regular or recombination is prevented (see discussion in Coyne et al. (1997)). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirito (1998) pointed out that the type of rearrangement was not a reliable indicator of its effect on fertility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[quote] In conclusion, the reduction in fitness due to the presence of a chromosomal rearrangement (especially in the case of inversions and Robertsonian rearrangements) is not foreseeable a priori solely on the basis of the nature of the structural rearrangement. The absence of definite rules means that it is necessary to experimentally analyze the level of selection against the heterozygote for each particular rearrangement of evolutionary interest. (p.321). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it should be clear that Casey Luskin’s remarks are simply not reflective of the current thinking in mammalian cytogenetics. In the next essay, I will take Spirito’s advice and examine the situation in mammals and specifically in humans more closely, so that we can get a better picture of the factors affecting the fixation of Human Chromosome 2.   &lt;/p&gt;

Here it is, just in case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This issue of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/span&gt; includes a paper by Prof. Michael Majerus of Cambridge University, a world expert on industrial melanism and a champion of the peppered moth as an excellent example of natural selection in the wild. In it, Prof. Majerus describes the controversy surrounding the peppered moth, much of it based on misrepresentations and misunderstandings. He also describes, with extraordinary modesty, his own widely respected research which has refuted the misplaced criticism of the peppered moth example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We consider the paper a testament to Prof. Majerus’s patience and dedication to settling debates in science as they should be settled – with evidence rather than rhetoric. In this regard, Prof. Majerus’s paper not only highlights an exquisite example of evolution in action, but also serves to illustrate how careful scientific study generates outstanding results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is with deep regret that we note that Prof. Majerus passed away peacefully during the night of January 26/27 from a brief but severe illness. As Prof. David Summers, Head of the Department of Genetics at Cambridge, wrote&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Mike Majerus was a traditional Cambridge scientist; a charismatic individual for whom the boundaries between life and work, and teaching and research, were very hard to discern. He was a world authority in his field, a tireless advocate of evolution and an enthusiastic educator of graduate and undergraduate students."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are proud to present Prof. Majerus’s article on the peppered moth and are grateful for his contribution to the journal, for his important and diligent research, and for his dedication to defending and enhancing science education. We extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues. He will be missed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T.

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2005, Casey Luskin wrote an &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2005/10/and_the_miller_told_his_tale_ken_miller_.html" rel="external "&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; criticizing Kenneth Miller’s testimony at the Dover ID trial called “And the Miller Told His Tale: Ken Miller’s Cold (Chromosomal) Fusion”. Luskin took Miller to task for showing that the chromosomal fusion which resulted in human chromosome 2  was evidence for the common ancestry between humans and the great apes. His argument was ably taken apart by PZ Myers &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/09/luskins_ludicrous_genetics.php" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and Mike Dunford &lt;a href="http://thequestionableauthority.blogspot.com/2005/10/dog-bites-man.html" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskin also wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; In other words, Miller has to explain why a random chromosomal fusion event which, in our experience ultimately results in offspring with genetic diseases, didn’t result in a genetic disease and was thus advantageous enough to get fixed into the entire population of our ancestors. Given the lack of empirical evidence that random chromosomal fusion events are not disadvantageous, perhaps the presence of a chromosomal fusion event is not good evidence for a Neo-Darwinian history for humans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Myers and Dunford pointed out those heterozygotes for the type of chromosomal fusion in question did not necessarily have to suffer from genetic disease or infertility. But they did not discuss the plausibility of the fixation of the fusion in the human population. In a series of forthcoming essays I will examine this, and also address some other common ID/creationist ‘problems’ with the fusion not mentioned by Luskin. The first problem is:   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dicentric Problem&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ID proponents on human chromosome 2 sometimes bring up the fact that a telomeric fusion results in a dicentric chromosome, that is, a chromosome with two centromeres. The following illustration of a similar kind of fusion shows how a dicentric chromosome can come about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/01/dicentric.jpg" alt="dicentric.jpg" width="432" height="325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Since the centromere is the point at which the spindle attaches to the chromosome at mitosis and meiosis, wouldn’t having two centromeres result in the possibility of the spindle attaching at &lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt;  points on the chromosome, pulling it apart? A common counterargument to this is that in many dicentrics, one centromere becomes inactivated, and, indeed, that seems to be the case in human chromosome 2.  But doesn’t that mean we now need &lt;em&gt;two mutations&lt;/em&gt;–first the fusion, then the centromere inactivation– to get a viable chromosome? Doesn’t that dramatically reduce the probability of the fusion becoming fixed? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. For a long time it was assumed all centromeres were pretty much alike, so it was also assumed that they were equally efficient at assembling kinetochores (the actual attachment point for the spindle).  A 1994 paper by Beth Sullivan and her lab at Duke University suggests that not all centromeres are equal: centromeres from non-homologous chromosomes appear to assemble kinetochores at different rates. Thus,  in a fusion between two non-homologous chromosomes,  like that of human chromosome 2, one centromere begins preparing its kinetochores before the other, and by being able to do so may interfere with the other finishing (or even beginning) in time for  the next phase of meiosis or mitosis.  As the paper says in the abstract (my emphasis):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximately 90% of human Robertsonian translocations occur between nonhomologous acrocentric chromosomes, producing dicentric elements which are stable in meiosis and mitosis,&lt;/strong&gt; implying that one centromere is functionally inactivated or suppressed. To determine if this suppression is random, centromeric activity in 48 human dicentric Robertsonian translocations was assigned by assessment of the primary constrictions using dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). &lt;strong&gt;Preferential activity/constriction of one centromere was observed in all except three different rearrangements. The activity is meiotically stable since intrafamilial consistency of a preferentially active centromere existed in members of six families&lt;/strong&gt;. These results support evidence for nonrandom centromeric activity in humans and, more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;suggest a functional hierarchy in Robertsonian translocations with the chromosome 14 centromere most often active and the chromosome 15 centromere least often active&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By essentially ‘out-competing’ the other centromere, normal segregation of the chromosomes at meiosis is achieved, without requiring two mutations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look familiar? It should. It seems to be some of the same data used in this well known figure (not from &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt;, by the way, but &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; has taken a chart, stripped out half the data, put it into new colors that make my eyes hurt, and put it on a background with chimpanzees having a snack — said chimpanzees occupying almost half the space allotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shock horror! I am offended! The monkey is unhappy! My sensibilities, in particular, recoil. Someone send the illustrators at &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; some copies of &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/"&gt;Tufte's&lt;/a&gt; books. I think I'll stick with Miller et al.'s version.&lt;/p&gt;

We can argue about how much influence DNA methods should have on alpha taxonomy (ranging from "none" to "who needs names, just use DNA sequences" -- the latter being DNA taxonomy rather than DNA barcoding, and not a position that I endorse).  What is silly to argue is that DNA barcoding would not have any practical roles that can't already be covered just as easily, cheaply, and accurately by morphology-based identification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a story in the New York Times about the importance of identifying which species are involved in airplane bird strikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/science/25birds.html"&gt;Identifying the Bird, When Not Much Bird Is Left&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It talks about the use of feathers and feet (i.e., morphology) and also describes the use of DNA (new word: "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snarge"&gt;snarge&lt;/a&gt;").  It does not mention DNA barcoding per se, but it bears noting that the &lt;a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/birdstrike2006/25/"&gt;FAA and USAF support DNA barcoding efforts at the Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;.  In general, it would be best to have as many tools as possible, including sequencing DNA and comparing this against the &lt;a href="http://www.barcodingbirds.org/"&gt;bird DNA barcode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.barcodingbirds.org/"&gt; dataset&lt;/a&gt;, which already encompasses more than 2600 species (out of about 10,000) and means to include every bird on the planet within the next several years.&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/9FHTA-yZlFE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234123851985"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hows_your_news_premiering_on_mtv">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b307116a06385b2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">"How's Your News" Premiering on MTV</title><published>2009-02-08T20:08:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T20:08:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hows_your_news_premiering_on_mtv" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.howsyournews.com"&gt;"How's Your News?"&lt;/a&gt; a news documentary series with reporters who have developmental and intellectual disabilities, is premiering on MTV tonight(? gah I have no sense for time concepts so sorry if I have that wrong!).  No reporters with an autism label, but plenty with similar "stuff" including speech and language differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting riled up about exploitation and social justice, this seems like a series that provokes quite the opposite response--it's about empowerment, respect, equality, disability-as-a-social-movement, and important paradigm shifts in the way people view disability and themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was not concocted for MTV; it's been going on for over 10 years.  From the &lt;a href="http://www.howsyournews.com/background"&gt;background section&lt;/a&gt; of the show's web site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we tell you about our background we'd like to answer one of the most frequently asked questions about "How's Your News?"  This question is: "Has anyone ever found this material offensive?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short, simple answer is: no.  We fully understand why people would express concern upon hearing the concept behind HYN, but we'd hope anyone with such concerns would take a look at the films we've made and get to know the background of this project.  All of our reporters, and their families, are very proud of this project.  The disability community has widely embraced this project, often using our films for training or inspirational purposes.  Far from being offensive, they provide a positive, empowering view of life with a disability.  That's our opinion.  Please watch our films and let us know what YOU think!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an in-depth &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/04/AR2009020404010.html"&gt;review in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; (italics mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...MTV's new "How's Your News?" show can be seen not as exploitation of people who have mental disabilities but rather as the expression of a subculture that has much to contribute to the mainstream but never had much of an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Contrary to typical dramatic depictions of "special" souls in supposedly sensitive movies, these disabled folk have senses of humor even about their own situations and circumstances. They are in on the joke; they are telling the joke; they are part of the greater joke being played on us all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the stars of the group is Bobby Bird, a man with Down syndrome who is in his 50s and who speaks in a private language that to others sounds very close to meaningless babble. He seems to know that's how people respond to him, however, and has fun with it, &lt;em&gt;turning the tables in a way that makes a supposedly normal person feel isolated and out of it -- ostracized, as mentally challenged people often are. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The reason for my italics is because in my other life as a trouble-making, punk rock brat I am always looking for an opportunity to do the same ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boing-Boing has put up a video clip (embedded below, sorry no subtitles) along with &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/02/05/boing-boing-video-ho.html"&gt;an article and review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time I can remember in my adult life I regret not having cable TV in order to watch this show.

I'm not sure what he would think of the 3-D and other visual effects. The movies that he's most enjoyed have included lots of music, though we did have a good time at &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/on-being-different-or-kung-fu-panda/"&gt;Kung Fu Panda&lt;/a&gt; with its unlikely, and roly-poly, hero, Po the Panda.  And frankly, the story and cast of characters in &lt;em&gt;Coraline&lt;/em&gt;---in particular, those in the parallel world Coraline enters through a door in the drawing room of her home, and especially the Other Mother, all of whom have buttons for eyes---seem downright creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I'm not one for scary movies (even "for" children). And it's just a movie, and an animated one at that, based on a best-selling children's &lt;a href="http://www.mousecircus.com/bookdetails.aspx?BookID=2"&gt;novel by Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Coraline&lt;/em&gt;, Other Mother seems (except for the sewn-on eyes) so perfect----she "cooks delicious meals, showers the little girl with praise, and asks Coraline to stay with her forever"----she's the embodiment of everything that Coraline's own mother lacks. At first Coraline is enchanted by this Other Mother and the house with interesting things to do (a theater in the house, a box of magical toys) and delicious food to eat (rather than leek and potato soup), and then she misses her own parents, however boring and harried and mundane they seem. But when she goes home they're missing and, after she ventures back through the drawing room door to find them, Coraline finds out that that the other world and all of its marvelous delights are but the transitory creations of the Other Mother, and that nothing, nothing, is as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;a href="http://browseinside.harpercollinschildrens.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780380807345"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; online and found how everything in that parallel world---Coraline's Other Father, the theater where Scottie dogs sit in the audience, the rat circus, even the house itself---are indeed made by the Other Mother. There's a reason the &lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/movies/06cora.html?ref=movies"&gt;New York Times review of the movie&lt;/a&gt; says that everyone in the other world has "buttons for eyes, like homemade dolls": The "wild wonderland" and "dream vaudeville" of the other world are only as "real" and "alive" as dolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://browseinside.harpercollinschildrens.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780380807345"&gt;Coraline&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href="http://browseinside.harpercollinschildrens.com/index.aspx?isbn13=9780380807345"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about wishes and the yearning---our yearning---for a better reality, or for what we imagine what would be better. You can dress up a doll to be whatever you please but it's still doll, a toy, not real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if Charlie--who's just the same age as the curious Coraline in the book---ever wishes that he had someone else as parents. (I would think he'd have reason to be annoyed at me, that-person-who's-always-directing-him-to-do-this-or-that.) Certainly I've come to have no wish for anyone than him as my child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting Charlie has not been easy but I think it's been best, and certainly most fun, when we've learned to accept our child for who he is, and not nurse yearnings for some "other child" and seek remedies and treatments to change him into another---a "normal"---child. Accepting him isn't (as people sometimes construe the word to be) "doing nothing." It's knowing that the child you have is the child you have and that parenting him is all about nurturing him as he is, for who he is, and not trying to change him into some fantasized other. If there's another Charlie out there, he's not my Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coraline learns that the parents and the life she's got may not be all that exciting and marvelous---may not always give her what she wants--but they're her parents, who love her as she is.  After her adventure in the other world, she sees her world with a renewed awareness of its color and wonder and, yes, magic and delight.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234121164140"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/black-history-month-at-jack-jill-politics.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/637962ce2154df81</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cultural Criticism"/><title type="html">Black History Month at Jack &amp;amp; Jill Politics</title><published>2009-02-08T19:09:55Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T19:09:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/02/black-history-month-at-jack-jill-politics.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t scold me -- I know I&amp;#39;m eight days behind.  Nevertheless:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jackandjillpolitics.com/tag/black-history-month-daily-thread/"&gt;Black History Month -- Daily Posts&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.jackandjillpolitics.com/"&gt;Jack &amp;amp; Jill Politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go, read, learn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234119763863"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-62556371">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d8ff4585be1a8e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religious Idiocy" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://sixapart.com/ns/types#tag"/><title type="html">Top Atheist Bloggers</title><published>2009-02-08T18:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T18:34:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/02/top-atheist-bloggers.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2009/02/top-atheist-bloggers.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel at Unreasonable Faith has just published his list of the &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/02/05/the-top-30-atheistagnostic-blogs/"&gt;Top 30 Atheist/Agnostic/Skeptic Blogs&lt;/a&gt; which includes Skeptico.  Thanks Daniel.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His top five are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;

&lt;td&gt;$2,000,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td colspan="2" align="right"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total = $1,202,000,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the package means NASA and the NSF each get over a billion dollars in additional funding, though apparently the Department of Energy office of science did not get any additional funding, which is a bummer (DOE did get $1B for energy efficiency research). NASA gets $500M for Shuttle replacement work, which is very badly needed, and $300M to go toward science (yay!). NSF gets a cool billion for research, which means lots and lots of scientists will be able to further our knowledge and make the world a better place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bill will go up for vote on Monday. It may still get voted down, though I doubt it; lots of compromises were made (too many, perhaps), so IMO a filibuster is unlikely. With people hurting as much as they are right now, and a clear mandate for change that’s swept the nation, anyone who looks obstructionist at this point is risking political suicide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll see how this plays out on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, anti-evolutionists regularly engage in less than honest tactics, including quote-mining, propaganda, and outright distortions, but in this case I applaud their candor.  Here are some of the notable arguments listed, many of which you have undoubtedly heard many times -- next time, just point out that even one of the leading creationist groups recognizes that these are not valid.  (Obviously, the spin provided on these differs from what scientists think -- see the &lt;a href="http://creationontheweb.com/content/view/2996/"&gt;original list&lt;/a&gt; for their explanations).&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"&gt;Which arguments should definitely not be used?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Darwin recanted on his deathbed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moon-dust thickness proves a young moon. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NASA computers, in calculating the positions of planets, found a missing day and 40 minutes, proving Joshua’s “long day” and Hezekiah’s sundial movement of Joshua 10 and 2 Kings 20.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Japanese trawler Zuiyo Maru caught a dead plesiosaur near New Zealand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If we evolved from apes, why are there still apes today?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women have one more rib than men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Archaeopteryx is a fraud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no beneficial mutations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No new species have been produced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paluxy tracks prove that humans and dinosaurs co-existed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Darwin’s quote about the absurdity of eye evolution from Origin of Species. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light was created in transit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"&gt;What arguments are doubtful, hence inadvisable to use?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Natural selection as tautology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evolution is just a theory. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is amazing modern scientific insight in the Bible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The speed of light has decreased over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no transitional forms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creationists believe in microevolution but not macroevolution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/d0ErKjfweAg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234114719720"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/here_we_go_again_floridas_turn.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/259ef738014427b4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Here we go again — Florida&amp;#39;s turn!</title><published>2009-02-08T16:33:48Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T16:33:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/mUzfTx3lS8k/here_we_go_again_floridas_turn.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/here_we_go_again_floridas_turn.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do these yahoos get elected?

A woman, Eluana Englaro, was in a car crash 17 years ago that caused catastrophic brain damage — she&amp;#39;s been in a vegetative state ever since, and the family has been engaged in a legal fight for many years to pull the plug and allow her to die with a little dignity. They finally won that battle recently, and are easing her off life support and a feeding tube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cue the right wing. Silvio Berlusconi, Bush-like Prime Minister of Italy, has rushed to impose an emergency decree blocking the suspension of life support, a decision made after consulting with the Vatican. Here's a good rule: never consult the priesthood of a death cult before making a life-and-death decision. They always give stupid and evil advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/08/englaro-italy-vatican"&gt;Berlusconi's rationalization is appalling and repugnant&lt;/a&gt;. He claims to be &amp;quot;rescuing&amp;quot; Englaro — not true, since she was effectively dead 17 years ago — and in what has to be the most tasteless and disgusting excuse made yet for the actions of these villains of the right, has further justified it by saying that physically she is &amp;quot;in the condition to have babies&amp;quot;. So, what is Berlusconi going to do next in his bizarro Prince Charming act? Fertilize her eggs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's nice to know that the Catholic Church's criteria for the value of a woman's life focus on the functionality of her ovaries rather than the existence of her mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/she_is_in_the_condition_to_hav.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/xPFcZheJz6w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234104607809"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=2971">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3d8f97286c9323d8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="Malaria"/><category term="Science"/><category term="mosquitoes"/><category term="Aedes"/><category term="DEET"/><category term="isolongifolenone"/><category term="ticks"/><title type="html">Cautiously excited: new repellent research</title><published>2009-02-08T14:46:12Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T14:46:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/02/08/cautiously-excited-new-repellent/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" alt="ResearchBlogging.org"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Looks like there could be a &lt;a href="http://esa.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/esa/jme/2009/00000046/00000001/art00013"&gt;new repellent compound&lt;/a&gt; to choose from on your shelves soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compound, isolongifolenone, is made from a tree with the charming name of &lt;a href="http://www2.fpl.fs.fed.us/TechSheets/Chudnoff/TropAmerican/htmlDocs_tropamerican/Humiriabalsamifera.html"&gt;Bastard Bulletwood&lt;/a&gt;.  From the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We show that (Ð)-isolongifolenone deters the biting of the mosquitoes Aedes aegypti (L.) and Anopheles stephensi Liston more effectively than the widely used synthetic chemical repellent…(DEET), in laboratory bioassays. The compound also repelled blacklegged ticks… and lone star ticks,  as effectively as DEET.&lt;br&gt;
Isolongifolenone is easily synthesized from inexpensive turpentine oil feedstock. We are therefore confident that the compound has significant potential as an inexpensive and safe repellent for protection of large human populations against blood-feeding arthropods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;img title="zangresults" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/zangresults.jpg?w=279&amp;amp;h=168" alt="zangresults" width="279" height="168"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their tests were done in the lab, so I want to see some actual biting data with humans to verify these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have a choice other than DEET, since while DEET’s relatively safe, it is known to melt your pantyhose and stain fabrics.  (Yeah. I know. Bug Girl is not known for pantyhose wearing. But sometimes I have to, and it’s a drag when your legs are covered in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; blood from smacked mozzies and stifling nylon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, not every mosquito species tested reacted the same way–some were more repelled than others. This is also true of DEET, so isn’t surprising.  The doses of active ingredient are similar to DEET, so unlike &lt;a title="Make it so!" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/07/15/whats-the-best-way-to-repel-mosquitoes/"&gt;Picaridin&lt;/a&gt;, you shouldn’t have to apply extra doses of lotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very (cautiously) exciting news!&lt;/p&gt;

And sometimes, they even suggest a perfectly good experiment for testing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, Kent Hovind suggested that we can test the hypothesis that the Noah’s Ark story in the Bible is true, and that layers of sediment in nature can be explained by the way sediment settles in a large amount of water. Unfortunately for Kent, he didn’t actually try this experiment before suggesting it. Fortunately for us, YouTube star &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Potholer54debunks"&gt;Potholer54debunks&lt;/a&gt; did do the experiment. He filmed it and included it in this 10-minute video that effectively destroys a number of geological claims made by creationists. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

He Scores! Fire the Coach!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a style="FLOAT:left" href="http://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e20111684c2f04970c-pi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a style="FLOAT:left" href="http://www.rescuepost.com/.a/6a00d8357f3f2969e201053712208c970b-pi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Dan Olmsted&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had a strange reaction to this week's story about the high school basketball team manager in Maine. As USA Today reported: "Patrick Thibodeau, who has Down Syndrome, trotted onto the floor Tuesday night for the team's final home game of the season. When the time came to shoot, he nailed a 3-pointer for the second basket of the game. He hit another at the final buzzer."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This reminds us of the awesome J-Mac, Jason McElwain, the team manager with autism who when he finally got the chance scored 6 three pointers in the last 4 minutes of the last game of his senior year. But here's my question: Let's say a third-string player on one of these teams hadn't been in a game all year -- or ever. Coach puts him in the last game. Just so mom and dad can cheer. Kid goes wild! Hits from DOWNTOWN!!! Is un-CON-scious! ... all those sportscaster phrases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wouldn't people say, What was this coach thinking? He had one of his best players sitting at the other end of the bench for four long years and didn't know it? Aren't we trying to win here? (We sure were back at Danville High School in Illinois.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I'm missing something -- some health concern, some Title IX thing, some nuance. If so, tell me. But geez, if the kid can play, let him play, not pick up sweaty towels. Don't make inclusion on the court or on the field a "very special," made-for-TV story. Make it typical."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was utterly shocked when I read this. Dan Olmsted, who could not find the Clinic For Special Children in Amish Country, has now found:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEURODIVERSITY!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan, I hope you have a day job.&lt;div&gt;

I am sure you have read articles where the reporter includes "both sides" of the issues addressed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, there is no need for "balance". for example, if the article is discussing the Holocaust, why would anyone need input from a Holocaust Denier? Their ideas have been totally discredited, and the historical event known as the Holocaust happened, whether they like it or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my scientifically and fact based opinion, the same thing goes for the manufactured questions over the need for a robust vaccination program. To any intelligent sentient being, the history of vaccination proves that they are effective and have eradicated diseases such as small pox, and polio (from the western world). Balance is not required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, like I said, reporters need to report balance. That is what they do. If they did not, they would be "taking sides" and that is something that journalism schools frown upon. So, I do understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, who do they go to for balance? Well, it seems to me that their favorite interview subject, the Exalted One of GR, is their favorite. Even the recent NY times article, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13auti.html?ref=health"&gt;Book Is Rallying Resistance to the Antivaccine Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, by Donald McNeil, quoted the EO. Let's take a look at the antics of the Exalted One...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to publication of that article, Mr. O'Neil contacted the Exalted One to obtain his opinion on the issues the article would be addressing, and afterwards, the Exalted One, posted this &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/01/nyt-mollycoddles-dr-offit.html"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This article was then followed by a &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/01/the-nyt-crypt-keepers-of-autism-journalism.html#more"&gt;diatribe &lt;/a&gt;ostensibly written by the Spoiled Brat of Autism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since it is a given that ALL articles on AoA advance the purposes of the Exalted One, GRrrrr, and the Junta, there is no doubt that the Brat's article was published with their full blessings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further, the SBofA also takes a few nasty shots at Dr. Nancy Snyderman, the medical reporter from the Today Show. There is no doubt that the Exalted One, GRrrr and the Junta despise her to no end. After all, she uses facts to base her opinions on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no doubt that being quoted in the New York Times, or, for that matter, in any reputable media outlet, gives credence to the person and their opinions. This is certainly true in their minds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Amanda Peet, an actress, expressed her personal opinion concerning vaccinations and those who refuse them, the Junta at AoA got on her case, and posted phone numbers and addresses of her agent, etc. and then encouraged the lemming to mail bomb them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, recently, one poster on the EoH Yahoo group did not like an &lt;a href="http://morganhilltimes.com/opinion/252914-its-time-to-renew-values-of-science-and-reason"&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;and posted the reporter's home address and phone number. The moderator of the group did remove it (however, it was up for a while, and, one can only wonder if he would have removed it had their not been an outcry?).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, the question that begs to be asked is this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why is the media still quoting these vicious know-nothings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I suggest freezing them out. There are anti-vaxxer who are, at least, civil.&lt;div&gt;

There are two pseudo-journalists who hang out there, and occasionally post something that makes one wonder about whether they learned fact checking in journalism school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;The 5CC award goes to &lt;strong&gt;Dan Olmsted&lt;/strong&gt;, for his tired efforts to retroactively cover his butt about his failure to find the Clinic For Special Children in Autism Country. I know he tried...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 6CC Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR:rgb(0,0,0)"&gt;and the winner is....&lt;strong&gt;David Kirby&lt;/strong&gt;, for his untiring efforts to post without checking his facts (when he finds some). Recently, David made two boo-boos in a three day period. At HuffPOOP, he posted an article where he imagined that the IACC meeting approved spending a couple of million dollars on vaccine research to prove the imaginary connection &lt;/span&gt;Autism. Strangely, no one else remembers this coming to a vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;Kevin, at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/"&gt;LeftBrain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt;, also addressed some of Kirby's boo-boos. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 7CC Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Things are getting tougher to figure out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;who is deserving of a bigger dose. Let's face it, AoA provides so much "good stuff" that picking out the best is not an easy task. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#000000"&gt;However, the 7CC Award goes to &lt;strong&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt;, who, admittedly does not post there, but, is the darling of the loonies. Jenny has done so much this year to garner this award, that it is nigh impossible for one blogger to list them all. However, some of her "accomplishments" include continuing to treat her son after she cured him of Autism, the Green Vaccine gambit, and gouging her main squeeze, Jim Carrey, for a cool $50,000,000. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;I hope that Jenny adds this award to her her pathetic resume as an "actor" so that she can get her failed career back on track. Maybe if she was busy making movies, and flashing her boobs, no one would notice what a boob she really is. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 8CC Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#000000"&gt;This award does no go to a person, but to AoA itself for their &lt;strong&gt;practice of using Autistic children and their willingness to tolerate any parent turning their child into a lab rat &lt;/strong&gt;to promote their false ideas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 9CC Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;goes to &lt;/span&gt;J. B. Handley. &lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Who else has promoted the AoA party line, used offensive tactics such as threatening litigation, "outing", flooding emails and other disgusting tactics to feebly attempt to silence those who disagree with him. Handley has lead the charge to attempt to discredit Paul Offit, M.D., impliedly asked his lemmings, the AoA faithful to attack Amanda Peet by contacting her publicists and others, and has outed posters with whom he disagrees. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#000000"&gt;Being obnoxious appears to be his labor of love, and he labors long and hard. He would deserve a larger award.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#cc0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fully Loaded 10CC Syringe Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#000000"&gt;goes to none other than the AoA lemmings, their incredibly credulous commenters who will believe anything the AoA Junta claims to be true. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#000000"&gt;These lemmings are of great concern to me, as their utter lack of critical thinking skills, lack of basic scientific understanding, and their astounding willingness to abuse their children by having the kids undergo one after another useless treatments clearly justifies their being presented this award. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#000000"&gt;And, there you have it. Ten awards for AoA, which can now claim to be the most award winning blog in the blogosphere. Hmmm...the only thing I do not have is a cute little graphic for the award. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;color:#000000"&gt;Just to "tease" my loyal and faithful readership, I will, during the next year, periodically award a "booster shot" from the same, multi-dose vial, when I see that AoAers are slipping. Does anyone know of a large warehouse where I can store a multi-gallon vial?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:180%;color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The past year has not gone well for you and the other anti-vaccinators at AoA, and their lemmings. let us review the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probably the biggest failure, as you see it, is the total and utter refutation of Wakefield's bogus claim that the MMR causes Autism. We started the years knowing that he was highly conflicted, and a hired gun for the attorneys in the now defunct British litigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later, we learned, through testimony of the leading experts in their fields, that Wakefield was told that the laboratory tests were tainted, and showed false positives. However, that did not stop him, and he published the paper anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This led to the current Measles epidemic in Great Britain where children are being needlessly hospitalized. Then, the epidemic popped up in the US. All among unvaccinated children whose parents were terrorized by Wakefield into not vaccinating their kids. How many have had permanent damage?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Prof. Stephen Bustin, relying on his unique expertise, and the recent &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0003140#pone.0003140-Barlow1"&gt;Hornig &lt;/a&gt;study, has &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/dec/09/medical-research-mmr-vaccine"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; on two of the other investigators who used Wakefield's tainted samples to repudiate his findings. What has the anti-vaccinators done? They are trying to twist the study to say that its supports Wakefield. Hogwash, and anyone with a reading comprehension level above elementary, knows it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the way, the Hornig study lists numerous articles, case control studies, etc. that show that Wakefield has not been replicated. Period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, Wakefield and the MMR scare declined, and is about to fall, assuming that the last few anti-vaccinators will find a shred of intellectual honest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, this entire affair resurrects Mady Hornig, of Columbia University, and brings her back into the realm of science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the new President coming into office, AoA was hoping that they would score a big appointment with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. being appointed to head the EPA. RFK, Jr. wrote a rather poorly researched and science devoid &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7395411/deadly_immunity/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; supporting the mercury causes autism mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the extensive proof that there is no link, &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/11/07/kennedy-obama-epa-oped-cx_wo_1107olson.html"&gt;Forbes Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, which is not one of my favorite periodicals, skewered that nicely. In an article entitled, Dangerous Kook At The EPA? Kennedy's deficiencies to run a cabinet level agency were clearly outlined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kennedy did not get that appointment. It seems that President Elect Obama has high standards, and a Kook does not fit in. AoA's hopes surely did decline and fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another problem for the anti-vaccinators was the fact that the California autism numbers just would not fall as they had hoped. Dr. Robert Schechter &lt;a href="http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/65/1/19"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The DDS data do not show any recent decrease in autism in California despite the exclusion of more than trace levels of thimerosal from nearly all childhood vaccines. The DDS data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to thimerosal during childhood is a primary cause of autism. "&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, those pesky numbers just would not go down like they were supposed to. Time to move the goal posts again...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things did not go well in Congress, either. Congressman Henry Waxman, chair of the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Reform, sent out an excellent letter to his colleagues in Congress which lays out the issues quite clearly. You can read about it &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1465"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sweetest part of this event was the fact that he repudiated his colleague, Dan Burton, who "investigated" Autism and vaccines a few years ago with hearings that provided a stage for modern day snake oil sales creeps. That was a waste of taxpayer money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, of course, it cause major conniptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of this would make a great year for evidence based autism and vaccination studies. It would be nice to just quit here. But, there is more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, who appears to be the one single most scary person to the AoAers and their lemmings, had his book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Autisms-False-Prophets-Science-Medicine/dp/0231146361"&gt;Autism's False Prophets&lt;/a&gt; published. The AoAers were apoplectic! They whinneyed and whined about what was written (without actually reading it), and bleated and brayed about Dr. Offit's supposed conflicts of interests (all of which were fully disclosed, and well explained.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The AoAers and their lemmings posted some of the most disgusting and hate filled comments about Dr. Offit. They were particularly upset that RotaTEQ, the vaccine he developed, was shown to saving &lt;a href="http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/rotavirus-vaccine-draws-rave-review-annual-gathering/2008-10-28"&gt;thousands of lives&lt;/a&gt;. I guess that the AoAers and their lemmings prefer dead children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It got better. &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001605/"&gt;Amanda Peet&lt;/a&gt;, an actor, made a statement where she called parents who do not vaccinate Parasites. Ms. Peet caused some howling and hollering on the part of the lemmings, and she apologized for saying they were lemmings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She said that after she had heard of the evils of vaccination, she conferred with Dr. Offit and went ahead and vaccinated her children. They AoAers were apoplectic! They posted the email address of her agent, etc. and encouraged emailing them. They proposed that her movies be boycotted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was rather humorous. The AoAers love Jenny McCarthy whose career started, and apparently reached its high point, when she exposed her all for Playboy (sorry, no link). Ms. Peet's career is still growing. She is a spokesperson for &lt;a href="http://www.ecbt.org/"&gt;Every Child By Two,&lt;/a&gt; founded by former First Lady, Rosalynn Carter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ms. Peet kicks Jenny's butt when she tells people not to listen to celebrities, but to go to the scientists for their advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My only complaint about Ms. Peet is that she wimped out and apologized for calling non-vaccinating parents parasites. They ARE parasites and freeloaders. Why apologize for telling the truth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, then Barack Obama was elected President. It has now turned out that this one single event may very well beckon the end of pseudo-science. His appointments have all been well grounded in science. Even his Attorney General designee, Eric Holder, got his start in a high school known for teaching science and mathematics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All-in-all the AoAers and their lemmings have had a very bad year. They lost as much as the Dow Jones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the Dow is expected to recover.&lt;div&gt;

Mr. McNeil, you see, is a real journalist, with credentials and experience far beyond that of J.B.'s paid mouthpiece, David Kirby. J.B. actually cites some of Mr. McNeil's experience. However, he strangely leaves out this from the &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/donald_g_jr_mcneil/index.html"&gt;official biography&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He has won several awards: For a series on patent monopolies on AIDS drugs in Africa, for a series on AIDS in one South African town, for a series on six diseases on the brink of eradication and for a series on third world cancer victims dying without morphine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh, so Mr. McNeil is an award winning journalist who just happens to be very knowledgeable on the subject of vaccination? J.B. cannot handle that. So he leaves it out. Intellectual chicken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of chickens, J.B. has been &lt;a href="http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/eviscerate"&gt;eviscerated &lt;/a&gt;by &lt;span&gt;Orac&lt;/span&gt;, over at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php"&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=109"&gt;Autism News Beat&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect that other &lt;span&gt;bloggers&lt;/span&gt; will pile on, since J.B. leaves so much to discuss wherever he goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, let us not underestimate J.B. He never, ever, passes up an opportunity to shoot himself in his foot. His first article concerning Mr. McNeil was on December 15, 2008, and, true to form, J.B could not resist providing his other foot with another wound on December 17, 2008.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;J.B. must hate his feet. No sooner than &lt;span&gt;Orac&lt;/span&gt; posting his excellent article, J.B. posts more of his &lt;span&gt;bleatings&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;brayings&lt;/span&gt; in a comment to &lt;span&gt;Orac's&lt;/span&gt; article. Once again, J.B. attacks his feet and is promptly disemboweled by &lt;span&gt;Orac&lt;/span&gt; and his &lt;span&gt;commenters&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is three &lt;span&gt;times&lt;/span&gt; J.B. has shot himself in his foot (The &lt;span&gt;Handley&lt;/span&gt; Hat-trick) over just one &lt;span&gt;teensy&lt;/span&gt;-weensy article &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THAT HAS YET TO&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; BE &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PUBLISHED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in&lt;/span&gt; the New York Times. But is it a &lt;span&gt;teensy&lt;/span&gt;-weensy article?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I submit that it is not. It gives Dr. &lt;span&gt;Offit's&lt;/span&gt; book continuing coverage in &lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt; publication that is synonymous with book reviews and &lt;strong&gt;BEST SELLERS.&lt;/strong&gt; Make no mistake, J.B. is deeply concerned that &lt;span&gt;AFP&lt;/span&gt; will get a good review and become more generally available. He e&lt;span&gt;ven&lt;/span&gt; mentions the sales ranking on Amazon.com.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;J.B. is, of course, using a logical fallacy to prove that &lt;span&gt;AFP&lt;/span&gt; is not worth reading. If &lt;span&gt;AoA&lt;/span&gt; ever uses logic, it is &lt;span&gt;fallacious&lt;/span&gt; logic. I doubt J.B. has read it. If so, he did not understand it. He has never demonstrated an ability to understand science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just checked our library system on line catalog. All of the editions of &lt;span&gt;EOH&lt;/span&gt; are on the shelves, and none of editions of &lt;span&gt;AFP&lt;/span&gt; are available. Some libraries have waiting list, or &lt;span&gt;restrict&lt;/span&gt; access to community members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now we know why J.B. has such a rotten disposition. He is suffering from the Agony of The Feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Special note: Recently, I was told that I was being too hard on Mr. Kirby and I should respect his "experience", etc. I do. However, his background pales in the light of Mr. McNeil's. I trust that this blogger will have an article posted forthwith criticizing J.B. for his attack on Mr. McNeil.&lt;div&gt;

Please send them by Dec. 10 to me at [&lt;span style="color:#3333ff"&gt;his email address&lt;/span&gt;]. There are several obvious categories involving people, events, publications and media moments. But true to our reader-inspired spirit here at AOA, we'll let you decide. Past winners -- who are thus ineligible though much appreciated -- include Jenny McCarthy as Person of the Year, Michelle Cedillo as Child of the Year, Ashley Reynolds as Media Person of the Year. But think creatively -- what mattered most in '08 and who or what deserves to be honored? Tell us why, too, and we'll run many of your comments, along with winners and runners-up, over the year-end holidays. (Worst moments, lousiest books, dumbest quotes also are welcome!

Mr. Kirby must have snoozed through the class on the &lt;a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/appealtoauthority.html"&gt;Appeal to Authority&lt;/a&gt;, and/or (most likely and) the &lt;a href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/appealtopopularity.html"&gt;Appeal to Popularity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the former, "Appeals to authority are always deductively fallacious; &lt;strong&gt;even a legitimate authority speaking on his area of expertise may affirm a falsehood&lt;/strong&gt;, so no testimony of any authority is guaranteed to be true." (Emphasis added).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the latter, "...popular opinion can be, and quite often is, mistaken. Hindsight makes this clear: there were times when the majority of the population believed that the Earth is the still centre of the universe, and that diseases are caused by evil spirits; neither of these ideas was true, despite its popularity. ..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do not be confused by this. I do want more research, especially into the genetic areas. If, during the course of genetic research it is shown that there is some likelihood that environmental factors do play a role in causation, then that finding should be followed-up.  I consider it a waste of money to focus on environmental causation simply because there is no evidence to sugges that this exists. Spend the limited research money on areas which are likely to produce results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AoA is replete with numerous instances of the use of logical fallacies. In fact, if they did not use logical fallacies, they would use no logic at all.&lt;div&gt;

Possibly a recent example of replication would be helpful in showing up some of the real (as opposed to manufactured) issues that arise. The paper I'll discuss is one of mine, but in keeping with our usual stricture against too much pro-domo writing, I won't discuss the substance of the paper (though of course readers are welcome to read it themselves). Instead, I'll focus on the two separate replication efforts I undertook in order to do the analysis. The paper in question is &lt;a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abstracts/inpress/Schmidt.html"&gt;Schmidt (2009, IJoC)&lt;/a&gt;, and it revisits two papers published in recent years purporting to show that economic activity is contaminating the surface temperature records - specifically &lt;a href="http://www.knmi.nl/~laatdej/2006joc1292.pdf"&gt;de Laat and Maurellis (2006)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/jgr07/M&amp;amp;M.JGRDec07.pdf"&gt;McKitrick and Michaels (2007)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these papers were based on analyses of publicly available data - the &lt;a href="http://www.mnp.nl/edgar/model/edgar2/"&gt;EDGAR&lt;/a&gt; gridded CO2 emissions, UAH MSU-TLT (5.0) and HadCRUT2 in the first paper, UAH MSU-TLT, CRUTEM2v and an eclectic mix of economic indicators in the second. In the first paper (dLM06), no supplementary data were placed online, while the second (MM07) placed the &lt;a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/jgr07/jgr07.archive.zip"&gt;specific data&lt;/a&gt; used in the analysis online along with an application-specific script for the calculations. In dLM06 a new method of analysis was presented (though a modification of their earlier work), while MM07 used standard multiple regression techniques. Between them these papers and their replication touch on almost all of the issues raised in recent posts and comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data-as-used vs. pointers to online resources &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM07 posted their data-as-used, and since those data were drawn from dozens of different sources (GDP, Coal use, population etc. as well as temperature), trends calculated and then gridded, recreating this data from scratch would have been difficult to say the least. Thus I relied on their data collation in my own analysis. However, this means that the economic data and their processing were not independently replicated. Depending on what one is looking at this might or might not be an issue (and it wasn't for me). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, dLM06 provided no data-as-used, making do with pointers to the online servers for the three principle data sets they used. Unlike for MM07, the preprocessing of their data for their analysis was straightforward - the data were already gridded, and the only required step was regridding to a specific resolution (from 1ºx1º online to 5ºx5º in the analysis). However, since the data used were not archived, the text in the paper had to be relied upon to explain exactly what data were used. It turns out that the EDGAR emissions are disaggregated into multiple source types, and the language in the paper wasn't explicit about precisely which source types were included. This was apparent when the total emissions I came up with differed with the number given in the paper. A quick email to the author resolved the issue since they hadn't included aircraft, shipping or biomass sources in their total. This made sense, and did not affect the calculations materially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of the data used, there are ongoing updates to the raw data. For the temperature records, there are variations over time in the processing algorithms (satellites as well as surface stations), for emissions and economic data, updates in reporting or estimation, and in all cases the correction of errors is an ongoing process. Since my interest was in how robust the analyses were, I spent some time reprocessing the updated datasets. This involved downloading the EDGAR3 data, the latest UAH MSU numbers, the latest CRUTEM2/HadCRU2v numbers, and alternative versions of the same (such as the RSS MSU data, HadCRUT3v, GISTEMP). In many cases, these updates are in different formats, have different 'masks' and required specific and unique processing steps. Given the complexity of (and my unfamiliarity with) of economic data, I did not attempt to update that, or even ascertain whether updates had occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these two papers then, we have two of the main problems often alluded to. It is next-to-impossible to recreate exactly the calculation used in dLM07 since the data sets have changed in the meantime. However, since my scientific interest is in what their analysis says about the real world, any conclusion that was not robust to that level of minor adjustment would not have been interesting. By redoing their calculations with the current data, or with different analyses of analogous data, it is very easy to see that there is no such dependency, and thus reproducing their exact calculation becomes moot. In the MM07 case, it is very difficult for someone coming from the climate side to test the robustness of their analysis to updates in economic data and so that wasn't done. Thus while we have the potential for an exact replication, we are no wiser about its robustness to possibly important factors. I however was able to easily test the robustness of their calculations to changes in the satellite data source (RSS vs. UAH) or to updates in the surface temperature products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MM07 used an apparently widespread statistics program called STATA and archived a script for all of their calculations. While this might have been useful for someone familiar with this proprietary software, it is next to useless for someone who doesn't have access to it. STATA scripts are extremely high level, implying they are easy to code and use, but since the underlying code in the routines is not visible or public, they provide no means by which to translate the exact steps taken into a different programming language or environment. However, the calculations mainly consisted of multiple linear regressions which is a standard technique, and so other packages are relatively easily available. I'm an old-school fortran programmer (I know, I know), and so I downloaded a &lt;a href="http://www.bio.umontreal.ca/casgrain/en/labo/regression.html"&gt;fortran package&lt;/a&gt; that appeared to have the same functionality and adapted it to my needs. Someone using Matlab or R could have done something very similar. It was a simple matter to then check that the coefficients from my calculation and that in MM07 were practically the same and that there was a one-to-one match in the nominal significance (which was also calculated differently). This also provides a validation of the STATA routines (which I'm sure everyone was concerned about).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processing in dLM06 was described plainly in their paper. The idea is to define area masks as a function of the emissions data and calculate the average trend  - two methods were presented (averaging over the area then calculating the trend, or calculating the trends and averaging them over the area). With complete data these methods are equivalent, but not quite when there is missing data, though the uncertainties in the trend are more straightforward in the first case. It was pretty easy to code this up myself so I did. Turns out that the method used in dLM07 was not the one they said, but again, having coded both, it is easy to test whether that was important (it isn't). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the data from various sources, my own codes for the processing steps, I did a few test cases to show that I was getting basically the same results in the same circumstances as was reported in the original papers. That worked out fine. Had their been any further issues at this point, I would have sent out a couple of emails, but this was not necessary.  Jos de Laat had helpfully replied to two previous questions (concerning what was included in the emissions and the method used for the average trend), and I'm sure he or the other authors involved would have been happy to clarify anything else that might have come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we done? Not in the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the conversation concerning replication often appears to be based on the idea that a large fraction of scientific errors, or incorrect conclusions or problematic results are the result of errors in coding or analysis. The idealised implication being, that if we could just eliminate coding errors, then science would be much more error free. While there are undoubtedly individual cases where this has been the case (&lt;a href="http://boscoh.com/protein/a-sign-a-flipped-structure-and-a-scientific-flameout-of-epic-proportions"&gt;this protein folding code&lt;/a&gt; for instance), the vast majority of papers that turn out to be wrong, or non-robust are because of incorrect basic assumptions, overestimates of the power of a test, some wishful thinking, or a failure to take account of other important processes (It might be a good idea for someone to tally this in a quantitative way - any ideas for how that might be done?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cases here, the issues that I thought worth exploring from a scientific point of view were not whether the arithmetic was correct, but whether the conclusions drawn from the analyses were. To test that I varied the data sources, the time periods used, the importance of spatial auto-correlation on the effective numbers of degree of freedom, and most importantly, I looked at how these methodologies stacked up in numerical laboratories (GCM model runs) where I knew the answer already.  That was the bulk of the work and where all the science lies - the replication of the previous analyses was merely a means to an end. You can read the paper to see how that all worked out (actually even the abstract might be enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite minor errors in the printed description of what was done and no online code or data, my replication of the dLM07 analysis and it's application to new situations was more thorough than I was able to do with MM07 despite their more complete online materials. Precisely because I recreated the essential tools myself, I was able to explore the sensitivity of the dLM07 results to all of the factors I thought important. While I did replicate the MM07 analysis, the fact that I was dependent on their initial economic data collation means that some potentially important sensitivities did not get explored. In neither case was replication trivial, though neither was it particularly arduous. In both cases there was enough information to scientifically replicate the results despite very different approaches to archiving. I consider that both sets of authors clearly met their responsibilities to the scientific community to have their work be reproducible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the bigger point is that reproducibility of an analysis does not imply correctness of the conclusions. This is something that many scientists clearly appreciate, and probably lies at the bottom of the community's slow uptake of online archiving standards since they mostly aren't necessary for demonstrating scientific robustness (as in these cases for instance). In some sense, it is a good solution to a unimportant problem. For non-scientists, this point of view is not necessarily shared, and there is often an explicit link made between any flaw in a code or description however minor and the dismissal of a result. However, it is not until the "does it matter?" question has been fully answered that any conclusion is warranted. The unsatisfying part of many online replication attempts is that this question is rarely explored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude? Ease of replicability does not correlate to the quality of the scientific result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh yes, the supplemental data for my paper are &lt;a href="ftp://data.giss.nasa.gov/pub/gschmidt/"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, on second thought, Wakefield deserves no pity at all. After all, he is the man who almost single-handedly launched the scare over the MMR vaccine in Britain when he published his infamous &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper in 1998&lt;/a&gt; in which he claimed to have linked the MMR vaccine to regressive autism and inflammation of the colon, a study that was followed up four years later with a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11950955?ordinalpos=7&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that claimed to have found the strain of attenuated measles virus in the MMR in the colons of autistic children by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It would be one thing if these studies were sound science. If that were the case, then Wakefield’s work would have been very important and would have correctly cast doubt on the safety of the MMR. Unfortunately, they were not, and, indeed, most of the authors of the 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper later withdrew their names from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, aided and abetted by &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/bad-science-bingo/"&gt;useful idiots in the media&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/"&gt;British newspapers and other media&lt;/a&gt; that sensationalized the story, and the antivaccine movement, which hailed Wakefield as a hero, Wakefield managed to drive MMR vaccination rates in the U.K. below the level of herd immunity, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;from 93% to 75%&lt;/a&gt; (and as low as 50% in some parts of London). As a result Wakefield has been frequently sarcastically “&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;thanked&lt;/a&gt;” for his leadership role in bringing the measles back to the U.K. to the point where, fourteen years after measles had been declared under control in the U.K., it was in 2008 &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919"&gt;declared endemic again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, this fear was based on the worst science imaginable. First, no scientist not associated with Andrew Wakefield has ever been able to replicate his work. Second, as was exposed by U.K. reporter &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm"&gt;Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt;, not only was Wakefield &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;paid big bucks by trial lawyers&lt;/a&gt; seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers for “vaccine injury” to do his studies on autistic children, a conflict of interest he never revealed and that had to be exposed through Deer’s investigations, but months before he published his &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper Wakefield had applied for a &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-patents.htm"&gt;patent on a an allegedly safer single measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that could succeed best if the safety of the MMR were called into doubt. Even after all of this came to light, leading to Wakefield’s correctly being dragged in front of the General Medical Council for &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6289166.stm"&gt;charges of scientific misconduct&lt;/a&gt;. Even after this, he still enjoys a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/07/as_if_there_were_any_doubt_about_the_cul.php"&gt;cult of personality&lt;/a&gt; that I can’t figure out, and is often portrayed as being “persecuted” by the British medical establishment. Third, was revealed at the Autism Omnibus proceedings when PCR expert Stephen Bustin &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/the_autism_omnibus_the_difference_betwee.php"&gt;testified about the shoddy methods&lt;/a&gt; at the laboratory used to do the PCR on the colon biopsies. In brief, the laboratory used was set up such that cross contamination between the plasmids used to maintain the measles virus sequences and the area where the PCR was done. PCR is very sensitive; if there is contaminating plasmid sequence, it is very easy to amplify and detect it even when there is nothing in your samples. Indeed, I’ve experienced this very problem on occasion in my own lab. Unfortunately, in the case of Wakefield’s research, no controls were done to make sure that contamination was detected in the negative controls. Finally, Wakefield’s results were roundly refuted in an attempt to replicate his work that &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=200"&gt;was published last year&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see, Wakefield’s work and ethics are about as bad as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought, until readers started sending me &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;this article published in &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, again by Wakefield’s nemesis Brian Deer. Holy crap. If only a fraction of the allegations in this article are true, not only is Wakefield an unscrupulous and incompetent scientist but he’s a scientific fraud as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor who sparked the scare over the safety of the MMR vaccine for children changed and misreported results in his research, creating the appearance of a possible link with autism, a Sunday Times investigation has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidential medical documents and interviews with witnesses have established that Andrew Wakefield manipulated patients’ data, which triggered fears that the MMR triple vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella was linked to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in February 1998 in an article in The Lancet medical journal. It claimed that the families of eight out of 12 children attending a routine clinic at the hospital had blamed MMR for their autism, and said that problems came on within days of the jab. The team also claimed to have discovered a new inflammatory bowel disease underlying the children’s conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our investigation, confirmed by evidence presented to the General Medical Council (GMC), reveals that: In most of the 12 cases, the children’s ailments as described in The Lancet were different from their hospital and GP records. Although the research paper claimed that problems came on within days of the jab, in only one case did medical records suggest this was true, and in many of the cases medical concerns had been raised before the children were vaccinated. Hospital pathologists, looking for inflammatory bowel disease, reported in the majority of cases that the gut was normal. This was then reviewed and the Lancet paper showed them as abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;complete story&lt;/a&gt; reveals behavior on the part of Wakefield that leaves me just shaking my head in disbelief. It’s simply unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back a minute. The original &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper examined the cases of twelve children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. In the paper, it was reported that in 8 of the 12 children with regressive autism the onset of developmental changes closely followed MMR vaccination and in one of the 12 it followed measles infection. Moreover, colonoscopy showed colon abnormalities “ranging  from lymphoid nodular hyperplasia to aphthoid ulceration.” In 11 children, biopsy histology showed patchy chronic inflammation in the colon. The conclusion was that there was an apparent association between MMR vaccination and a syndrome of regressive autism and inflammatory bowel changes. Even though the paper’s tone was more tentative than one would have thought given the furor it launched and even though it stated that the authors “did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described,” Wakefield promoted his results to the media as though he had definitely found a link between the MMR vaccine and a syndrome consisting of regressive autism and inflammatory bowel disease. Thus was launched the scare that &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683687.ece"&gt;caused a thousand cases of measles (in 2008)&lt;/a&gt; that could have been avoided and caused many autistic children to be subjected to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/12/an_autistic_child_pays_the_price_of_andr.php"&gt;invasive procedures they didn’t need&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes at the cost of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the latest information is true, however, Wakefield is guilty of more than shoddy science and unreported conflicts of interest. He is guilty of scientific fraud and falsifying the medical reports of these children. For example, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;take Child 11&lt;/a&gt;, whose father requested a second set of testing on his child’s biopsy specimens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;MR ELEVEN’S taxi dash was a small ride in his desperate quest to find an answer for his son’s condition. Today, Child Eleven is much improved: at 17, he is a terrific scholar, although too nervous to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra tests on his biopsies produced striking results. His father asked the cancer institute to look for the measles virus, which lay at the heart of Wakefield’s concerns over the vaccine. According to a theory that underpinned the project, this virus in MMR was the cause of bowel disease, which then did damage to children’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It took a big fight to get the information,” said Mr Eleven. “They told me there was no measles virus. I had the tests repeated three times at different labs in the US, and they all came back negative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This struck a different note from what Wakefield suggested when describing his research to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We would not have presented this paper to &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; had we not undertaken extensive virological studies already,” he told the 1998 press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this anomaly could simply have been due to the aforementioned incompetence of the lab that Wakefield used to test his specimens for MMR strain measles virus, with its procedures guaranteed to produce false positives. Unfortunately, there’s more. A lot more. Take Child One:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the paper this claim would be adopted, with Wakefield and his team reporting that Child One’s parents said “behavioural symptoms” started “one week” after he received the MMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy’s medical records reveal a subtly different story, one familiar to mothers and fathers of autistic children. At the age of 9½ months, 10 weeks before his jab, his mother had become worried that he did not hear properly: the classic first symptom presented by sufferers of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly common story among parents who believe that vaccines caused their child’s autism. Many vaccines are scheduled to be given during the same time that children often show the first behavioral alterations associated with autism, and it is not uncommon either for such changes to occur within a few weeks of a vaccination by random chance alone, nor is it uncommon for parents to remember incorrectly that the child’s symptoms started soon after a vaccine when they did not. Indeed, it is not uncommon at all for experts to be able to detect the subtler signs of autism on videotapes of babies before the parents noticed and before the child received the vaccinations for which parents blame the condition. Unfortunately, human memory is fallable, and it easily relates events that are not closely related, particularly in response to other information or preexisting beliefs. This happens all the time with vaccines and autism, where numerous epidemiological studies have failed to find an association between either mercury in thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, between MMR and autism, and between vaccines in general and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Child Two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was Child Two, an eight-year-old boy from Peter-borough, Cambridgeshire, diagnosed with regressive autism, which, according to the Lancet paper, started “two weeks” after his jab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this child’s medical records, backed by numerous specialist assessments, said his problems began three to five months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list goes on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one was a girl, Child Eight, aged 3, from Whitley Bay, Tyne &amp;amp; Wear. She was reported in the journal as having suffered a brain injury “two weeks” after MMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her medical records did not support this. Before she was admitted, she had been seen by local specialists, and her GP told the Royal Free of “significant concerns about her development some months before she had her MMR”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child Six, aged 5, and Child Seven, aged 3, were said to have been diagnosed with regressive autism, with an onset of symptoms “one week” and “24 hours” after the jab respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But medical records show that neither boy was “previously normal”, as the Lancet article described all the children, and that both had already been hospitalised with brain problems before their MMR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child Six received his vaccine at the age of 14 months, but had twice previously been admitted with fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child Seven was given his at the age of 20 months but, again, problems already showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, one of two things happened, neither of which is flattering to Wakefield. Either he took the history from parents, for whom confirmation bias could easily have led to remembering incorrectly that their child’s behavioral changes were noted shortly after the MMR rather than before it or months later, in which case Wakefield was incompetent for not having examined the medical records. Alternatively, Wakefield did examine the medical records and lied about them in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper. Take your pick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I might have been willing to give Wakefield somewhat of the benefit of the doubt, viewing the discrepancies between the medical records and what he reported in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper as being yet more evidence of his shoddiness and incompetence rather than malice, were it not for the major discrepancies between what Wakefield said about the histology of the biopsy specimens in the paper. The Lancet paper described a uniform pattern of patchy inflammation, but apparently what Wakefield reported does not jibe with what the pathologists saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The uniformity of the intestinal pathological changes and the fact that previous studies have found intestinal dysfunc-tion in children with autistic-spectrum disorders, suggests that the connection is real and reflects a unique disease process, ” the Lancet Paper explained of the “syndrome”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet pathology records of samples taken from the children show apparent problems with this evidence. The hospital’s consultants who took biopsies from the children’s colons concluded that they were not uniform but varied and unexceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Child Eight, the pathology report said: “No abnormality detected”, while the Lancet paper said: “Nonspecific colitis”. This pattern was repeated for two of the other children, Nine and Ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most striking change of opinion came in the case of Child Three, a six-year-old from Huyton, Merseyside. He was reported in the journal to be suffering from regressive autism and bowel disease: specifically “acute and chronic nonspecific colitis”. The boy’s hospital discharge summary, however, said there was nothing untoward in his biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not happy with the readings of the pathologists, apparently Wakefield’s research team met for a “research review” of the biopsy specimens. This in and of itself is not unusual. However, it is unusual that the research team overturned the original readings of so many of the specimens. As Brian Deer put it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not an unusual move for a group of specialists to reconsider the evidence upon which their research was relying. It was nevertheless striking that their conclusion was that 11 of the children’s bowels were in fact diseased when their colleagues had found no abnormalities in at least seven of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite frankly, such conduct beggars the imagination. It’s about as unethical as it gets. But it’s all of a piece with Andrew Wakefield’s behavior. After all, as I pointed out before, he was in the pocket of a lawyer named Richard Barr seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers for “vaccine-induced” autism before he undertook his research. Not only that, but Barr was affiliated with the antivaccine group &lt;a href="http://www.jabs.org.uk/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jabs&lt;/a&gt;, and Wakefield apparently concocted his new “syndrome” after at least some consultation with Barr. But perhaps the most unethical, at least from a human research standpoint, was that the patients recruited to his study were not anything resembling a random or neutral sample. As pointed out by Brian Deer, the parents of these children heard through word of mouth about Wakefield. Add to that the fact that Wakefield subjected these children to unnecessary invasive medical procedures, and then incompetently analyzed the specimens obtained from them for measles virus to produce a virtually preordained result, even if it took scientific fraud to do it, and you see what I mean. Given such a level of ideological blindness that seems to think his cause so just that good science and ethics are optional in pursuit of it, a lack of concern over blatant conflicts of interest, and an appallingly inflated opinion of himself that he is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/07/andrew_wakefield_the_galileo_gambit_writ.php"&gt;seems to believe that he is actually a persecuted Galileo&lt;/a&gt;, is it any surprise that Wakefield may have stooped so far as to falsify research results in his campaign?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to me, it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, none of this will matter to antivaccinationists, who view Wakefield as exactly that–a persecuted scientific hero. Although I have yet to see any response from antivaccine blogs like like Age of Autism, I’m sure that they’ll wax ridiculous about what a great doctor and man Wakefield is and how it’s  big pharma and its minions who, frightened by the implications of Wakefield’s work, are working hard to demonize him and suppress his “science.” Unfortunately for their reality-challenged world view, sometimes things are as they appear, sometimes there really is no conspiracy, and sometimes a rat is a rat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Wakefield is most definitely a rat. A rat who caused &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683687.ece"&gt;thousands of cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; and at least &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/4871728.stm"&gt;one death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s not yet clear to me what he&amp;#39;s for, exactly — I&amp;#39;m reminded of the old joke about the post-modern gang leader who makes you an offer that you can&amp;#39;t understand — but it&amp;#39;s clear what he&amp;#39;s against, namely the idea that texts have meanings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The objective facts and rules of calculation that are to ground interpretation and render it principled are themselves interpretive products: they are, therefore, always and already contaminated by the interested judgments they claim to transcend. &lt;em&gt;[Consequences]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a small point, in his view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It might seem that the thesis that there is no such thing as literal meaning is a limited one, of interest mainly to linguists and philosophers of language; but in fact it is thesis whose implications are almost boundless, for they extend to the very underpinnings of the universe as it is understood by persons of a certain cast of mind. &lt;em&gt;[Introduction: Going Down The Anti-Formalist Road]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;cast of mind&amp;quot; in question is, roughly, science and the idea that rational inquiry can lead towards truth — the whole Enlightenment project. But in the passage just quoted, he&amp;#39;s discussing a much more specific argument, made by &lt;a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/schools/humanities/depts/philosophy/people/academic/kempsonr/"&gt;Ruth Kempson&lt;/a&gt; in her 1975 book &lt;em&gt;Presupposition and the delimitation of semantics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish uses an argument from this book as the rhetorical backbone of his 33-page lead-off essay "Introduction: Going Down the Anti-Formalist Road". And it's therefore embarrassing (for him) that he's misunderstood the context (and thus the content) of her work, in a way that makes her argument at best irrelevant to the point that he wants to use it to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fish first deploys Kempson in the second sentence of his essay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It is one of the theses of this book that many of the issues in interpretive theory can be reduced to a few basic questions in the philosophy of language. Consider, for example, the discussion of "presupposition" in Ruth Kempson's &lt;em&gt;Presupposition and the Delimitation of Semantics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Fish explains, Kempson raised the question of whether presupposition is "a relation between statements (parallel to entailment, synonymy, et.)" or "a property of the speaker's belief in uttering a sentence", and observed that "if presuppositions in terms of speaker-belief are considered to be a part of the semantic interpretation of sentences", then the meaning of sentences can't simply be defined "in terms of the relation between a symbol or set of symbols and the object or state described".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes Kempson to be making an argument with devastating consequences for rational inquiry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Once you start down the anti-formalist road, there is no place to stop; remove the connection between observable features and the specification of meaning, and you also remove everything else that is supposedly independent of context: entailment, contradiction, grammaticality itself, all become as variable and contingent as presupposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he depicts Kempson as drawing back in horror from the logical implications of her argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This, however, is not the conclusion Kempson reaches; and indeed it is the specter of reaching it that drives her in the opposite direction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the context of Kempson's 1973 PhD thesis, republished as her 1975 book, was  not an argument about whether rational inquiry is possible, or even (mainly) an argument about whether &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001194.html"&gt;meanings are things that sentences have, or things that people do&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, it was an argument among linguists and philosophers of language about whether proof theory or model theory is a better way to think about natural language semantics. More concretely, it was an argument about whether natural-language words and phrases should be interpreted directly, piece by piece, or whether they should first to be translated into some other representation, and interpreted only in that derived form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, the term "formal" usually had the meaning implied by the title of Richard Montague's famous 1970 essay "English as a formal language".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montague argued that natural languages like English could be treated semantically as if they were &amp;quot;formal languages&amp;quot;, in the sense that the meaning of phrases could be calculated recursively from the meaning of their parts, as denotations in a &amp;quot;model&amp;quot; universe. A simple analogy for this process is the recursive interpretation of subexpressions in a desk-calculator language — each atomic expression denotes a number, and so does every successively more complex expression, in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t depend on the context that the expression appears in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the work of Frege and Russell on the logic of quantifiers, it seemed obvious that natural languages can't work that way. The key to a coherent account of sentences with multiple quantifiers seemed to require abandoning the idea that noun phrases like "some people", much less words like &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;, are referring expressions at all. For Bertrand Russell and those who followed him, the way to make semantic sense of English was to figure out how to translate it into a different language — some kind of predicate calculus, for example — and then to work on the semantics of the translated form, whose sub-expressions are not in any sort of one-to-one correspondence to those of the natural-language original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montague showed that this wasn't necessarily so, at least not for the standard cases of multiple quantifiers and so on. His work was enormously influential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were always contrary voices. You could call them "anti-formalist", in the sense that they opposed the idea that English words and expressions should be assigned denotations as if they were the subexpressions of a "formal language". And the key issues that concerned them generally had to do with the role of context in interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, though, their contrary argument was not that a formal account of meaning is misguided and impossible — just that it needs to include a formal account of the role of context, by constructing context-dependent representations in terms of which grammaticality, entailment and so on can be calculated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth Kempson has recently written a very readable account of the past three decades of work along these lines: "&lt;a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/03/20/96/Semantics-heusinger-oct252007.pdf"&gt;The (re-)emergence of representationalism in semantics&lt;/a&gt;", to appear in Maienborn et al., &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Semantics&lt;/em&gt;. Her abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The major challenge posed to all those seeking to explain semantic properties of natural language is the pervasive dependence on context for the way in which expressions are understood. This chapter surveys the emergence of formal models of semantics against the background of the new emphasis in linguistics during the 1950's of formal modelling of grammars, and then details the way in which formal semanticists have increasingly turned to tools of proof theory for formal languages as they have grappled with this challenge. As we shall see, the starting point for this modelling of context dependence involved fierce disagreement between the protagonists as to whether or not explanations of natural-language content required some form of semantic representation, a view which those working within formal semantics paradigms initially so effectively ridiculed that this alternative was barely aired at all within semantics for the last decades of the last century. Yet as formal tools have been increasingly refined in order to express this pervasive context-dependence, the disagreement that led early on to the setting-aside of representationalism in semantics as a respectable methodology has, as we shall see, got so transformed that the initially conflicting sets of assumptions are now hard to distinguish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare this to Fish's version of where the "anti-formalist" road should take us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A formalist believes that words have clear meanings, and in order to believe that (or because he believes that) he must also believe (1) that minds see those clear meanings clearly; (2) that clarity is a condition that persists through changes in context; (3) that nothing in the self interferes with the perception of clarity, or, that if it does, it can be controlled by something else in the mind; (4) that meanings are a property of language; (5) that language is an abstract system that is prior to any occasion of use; (6) that occasions of use are underwritten by that system; (7) that the meanings words have in that system (as opposed to the meanings they acquire in situations) are or should be the basis of "general" discourses like the law; (8) that because they are general rather than local, such discourses can serve (in the form of rules or statues) as constraints on interpretive desires; (9) that interpretive desires must (and can) be set aside when there is serious public business afoot; (10) that the fashioning of a just political system requires such a setting aside, the submission of the individual will to impersonal and public norms (encoded in an impersonal and public language); (11) that this submission would be a rational act, chosen by the very will that would be held in check; (12) that rationality, like meaning, is an abstract system that stands apart from the contexts in which its standard is to be consulted; (13) that the standard of rationality is available for the settling of disputes between agents situated in different context; (14) that the mark of a civilized (lawful) community is the acknowledgment of that standard as a referee or judge; (15) that communities whose members fail to acknowledge that standard are, by definition, &lt;em&gt;ir&lt;/em&gt;rational; and (16) that irrationality is the state of being ruled by desire and force — that is, by persuasion — rather than by a norm that reflects the desires of no one, but protects the desires of everyone. All of these beliefs and more follow from and give support to the belief that words have clear meanings, and many of the essays in this book begin by challenging the linguistic thesis and end by challenging everything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one positive conclusion from Fish&amp;#39;s work that I believe I&amp;#39;ve grasped, so far, is the crucial role of what he calls &amp;quot;interpretive communities&amp;quot; in providing enough of a shared context — even if ephemeral and unfounded — for some minimal communication to take place. So it&amp;#39;s ironic that he so completely fails to understand Kempson&amp;#39;s work in the context of her native interpretive community.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234093545595"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_198.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffd9886ceec960f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-02-08T08:58:34Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T08:58:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/2F_gRie3JkM/clock_quotes_198.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_198.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A dog teaches a boy fidelity, perseverance, and to turn around three times before lying down. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1998 &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9500320?ordinalpos=11&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; which was published in the Lancet signalled the beginning of the anti-vacc movement and is considered responsible for a 12% decrease in the vaccination rate in the UK. Wakefield is being investigated for serious professional misconduct along with John Walker-Smith and Simon Murch, two professors who contributed to the research. All three have denied any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:368px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/news-graphics-2007-_640547a1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="news-graphics-2007-_640547a1" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/news-graphics-2007-_640547a1-300x239.jpg" alt="Andrew Wakefield attends the hearing in 2008, flanked by his wife and supporters displaying placards." width="358" height="284"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wakefield attends the hearing in 2008, flanked by his wife and supporters displaying placards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investigation, begun in July 2008 by the General Medical Council in the UK accused the three of acting dishonestly and unethically in compiling the research, which suggested there could be a link between the triple jab, bowel disease and autism. However, it has since been revealed that Dr Wakefield allegedly paid children £5 to take their blood at his son’s fifth birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key claims is that Dr Wakefield accepted £50,000 for research to support parents’ attempts to fight for compensation. Among the 46 allegations, Dr Wakefield was accused of allowing one patient - Child 10 - to be given an experimental drug, “Transfer Factor”, with a view to it becoming a measles vaccine. Further, he admitted being involved in proposals in 1998 to set up a company - Immunospecifics Biotechnologies Ltd - to manufacture the drug, with the intention that the father of Child 10 become its managing director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also admitted proposing that the equity in the company would be split between himself, as its research director, the father and other parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Times investigation by Brian Deer, claims to have confirmed evidence presented to the General Medical Council (GMC), which states that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In most of the 12 cases, the children’s ailments as described in The Lancet were different from their hospital and GP records. Although the research paper claimed that problems came on within days of the jab, in only one case did medical records suggest this was true, and in many of the cases medical concerns had been raised before the children were vaccinated. Hospital pathologists, looking for inflammatory bowel disease, reported in the majority of cases that the gut was normal. This was then reviewed and the Lancet paper showed them as abnormal”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it is revealed that Wakefield faked the data, it is unlikely to end the anti-vacc movement. THe case continues. We wait with baited breath to see the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scepticsbook.com/feed/</id><title type="html">The Skeptics&amp;#39; Book of Pooh-Pooh</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scepticsbook.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234083870640"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/why_good_science_journalists_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cde5366a5e05da95</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Reporting"/><title type="html">Why good science journalists are rare?</title><published>2009-02-08T07:08:38Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T07:08:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/KygY-b-lmXU/why_good_science_journalists_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/why_good_science_journalists_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Science coverage in New York Times is good because they can afford a whole stable of people, each expert in one field only. If &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; was forced to cover, on a daily basis and without time to research, everything from astronomy and physics to archaeology and materials science, he would do a bad job, too. But he is given time to pick his own area - evolution - to study it for years, and to write whatever the heck he wants on any given week. So Carl is an expert on what he is writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small paper with one science beat reporter will have to cover everything and that reporter will thus cover everything poorly. I covered this in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/this_morning_on_the_radio_-_po.php" title=""&gt;last segment of my radio interview&lt;/a&gt; last week - for science reporting, one needs a distributed net of experts, each weak on almost everything and each exceptionally strong on one thing only. And that is: science bloggers, the real experts in their fields. If it's physics news, you go see what physics bloggers are saying. For evo-devo, you go to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" title=""&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt;, for circadian stuff, you come to me - if I have not blogged it yet, just ask me in the comments what I think of the latest study that is making the round of news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a newspaper/magazine and a large net of bloggers could strike a deal, that would benefit everyone. Seed did. Others should do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another note - every time we bash science journalists, someone comes up in the comments and says: Hey, how about Zimmer, or &lt;a href="http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/" title=""&gt;Olivia Judson&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/" title=""&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/" title=""&gt;David Dobbs&lt;/a&gt;? They are good, aren't they? Thus, science journalists are excellent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer is, not just that they are free to write only about their area of expertise, but they also are bloggers (or, like Nicholas Wade, are open-minded and willing to learn from the criticisms by bloggers when he messes up something), and had plenty of time to learn how to behave online and to &lt;a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2008/09/18/because_we_have.html" title=""&gt;upgrade their ethics from journalistic so-called ethics to bloggers' ethics&lt;/a&gt;. This is why they are good. As the journalism is moving from print to Web, it is important for journalists to start blogging in order to learn the ethics of the Web and the proper Web etiquette - how to behave online in a way that will bring them respect from the readers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the fact that only a handful of such names keep popping up over and over again is a proof that such good science journalists are rare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/why_good_science_journalists_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/KygY-b-lmXU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234083870639"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_evolution_of_facebook.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/15612b94dc42f130</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">The Evolution of Facebook</title><published>2009-02-08T06:53:32Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T06:53:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Y0_lMNZUMcg/the_evolution_of_facebook.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_evolution_of_facebook.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been on Facebook since the beginning, in 2005. I explored it and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/09/facebook_political_affiliation.php" title=""&gt;studied it&lt;/a&gt;. I always spent minimal amount of time on it, though. I get e-mail notifications and perhaps once a day go there to click on all the "Ignore" buttons for all the invitations. So, I do not see is as a big &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2009/01/facebook_vs_alone_time.php" title=""&gt;time drain&lt;/a&gt;. But every now and then I get useful piece of information there, or an invitation to something I want to attend. I also use it to monitor what my kids are doing there. It is also nice to reconnect to some people I have not heard of in 20-30 years and see what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am on my third set of friends now.  The first - lots of people at NCSU I used for the study linked above - got unceremoniously dumped once the study was done.  I did not know 99% of those kids and was not interested in their activities. The second cohort were people with Yugoslav last names. I explored their habits - most of them are expat kids, some of them still in the Balkans - and saw that they friended each other regardless of ethnicity: Serbs with Croats with Macedonians with Bosnians, etc., they joined the same Yugo-nostalgic groups (lovers of chocolate bananas, or Djordje Balasevic), and generally frowned upon overt displays of nationalism. I saw that and liked it: the parents screwed up, but the kids are OK. Then I dumped them and built my current cohort out of bloggers, scientists, tech/PR folks, etc., with just a few remaining ex-students, Yugoslavs, old high-school friends and, more recently, lots of family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I use Facebook not just to connect to people, but also to promote myself, my blog, my events, and my employer - pure PR, which sometimes works (as I can see from comments, traffic coming from there, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/" title=""&gt;danah boyd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://fstutzman.com/" title=""&gt;Fred Stutzman&lt;/a&gt; got dissertations on this topic, studying social networks.  And no, "friend" online &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2009/02/facebook_friends.php" title=""&gt;does not mean&lt;/a&gt; what many newbies think it means. Throws off some people initially, I know. It's a contact. On FB it's called 'friend', on Twitter it's a Follower, on FriendFeed it's a Subscriber, etc. FB friend is as friendly as your blog's RSS feed subscribers, or they can be real friends - this is up to you and your individual use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On FB, you can &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2009/01/30/30readwriteweb-how_to_friend_mom_dad_and_the.html" title=""&gt;separate&lt;/a&gt; your contacts into groups, e.g., family, Real Life friends, colleagues, old highschool friends, blog-friends, customers, potential customers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has evolved over the five years. Initially, FB was for college students only, soon highschoolers were added as well. They tended to friend people who they were RL friends with, hence the origin of the name. Initially, kids used it for social networking: finding people they know, their RL friends to organize parties, share homework, and keep in touch after graduation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, bloggers, techies and PR-folks joined FB at the time new apps were introduced. They used it for business networking - promoting their brand, finding like-minded people, political organizing, etc. The two groups (~20s and ~40s) tried to stay away from each other, as the two style of FB use clashed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bi-modal distribution of FB users got disrupted over the last year - lots more 25-35-somethings joined in as well as non-tech, non-bloggy, non-business oldsters - the non-tech savvy: your Mom, your highschool friends who have otherwise no presence online... This new cohort is using FB in a middle-way, bridging the two groups already there. Some of them use FB like highschoolers - for social networking, organizing parties and flirting. Others use it like us - for business networking, organizing conferences and meetups, etc. Some combine the two quite well and are bridging the divide between the two older cohorts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they differ from the older cohorts by their use of communication tools on FB: the two older cohorts use Walls, Groups, Pages, Events, etc., i.e., all public spaces. The newest cohort is old-timey in that way: once they friend you, they prefer to switch on the privacy shades and Direct Message you on FB, or even switch to e-mail or Skype - their notions of privacy as they change in the 21st century are not well developed yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is great at finding people.  It is not as good for finding things: data, information, people who are interested in same things.  At about the same time - over the past year or so - blog/tech/PR types discovered FriendFeed which is better for finding people interested in the same things. Until then, FB did that job OK, but FF does it better. FB for those people is like a not-so-boring version of LinkedIn now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Facebook has its utility.  It does not do everything for everyone, but it has its place in the ecosystem of online social networks. And it is flexible enough that everyone can adapt Facebook to his or hers own needs. There is no one right way to use it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_evolution_of_facebook.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Y0_lMNZUMcg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234080150054"><id gr:original-id="94 at http://www.baskeptics.org">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/43c7fb716efa29fc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Happy 200th Birthday, Mr Darwin</title><published>2009-02-08T07:26:04Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T07:26:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.baskeptics.org/blog/09/02/094-happy-200th-birthday-mr-darwin" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.baskeptics.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://bad-language.com/images/darwin.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="10" align="right" title="Charles Darwin"&gt;Happy 200th (posthumous) Birthday to &lt;strong&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn't look a day over 190...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year marks the 200th year since Darwin was born, on February 12, 1809. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Celebrating this date, known as &lt;strong&gt;Darwin Day&lt;/strong&gt;, is celebrating science, skepticism and humanity; and most of all, our better understanding of the way the world works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year also marks the 150th anniversary of the publication of the evolutionary biologist's seminal work, &lt;strong&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate these two anniversaries, there are festivities throughout the world, and of course, across the Bay Area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festivities have already begun, with a lecture by our own &lt;strong&gt;Dr Genie Scott&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;University of California Museum of Paleontology&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/strong&gt;. The event was extremely popular!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday 8, 2009 the tireless Genie will be also be speaking at &lt;a href="http://www.sfatheists.com/darwinday2009.htm"&gt;Evolutionpalooza!&lt;/a&gt;, a Darwin Day celebration to be held at &lt;strong&gt;San Francisco Main Branch Public Library&lt;/strong&gt;. There will be other speakers, guests, games, drinks, and cake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Darwin Day itself, there will be an informal lecture at the &lt;a href="http://www.calacademy.org/darwin"&gt;California Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps you'd simply be interested in a drink over a board game at &lt;a href="http://www.darwinday.org/events/listing.php?id=12947"&gt;Doc's Clock&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few local events. To see what's on where, check out the official &lt;a href="http://www.darwinday.org/"&gt;Darwin Day&lt;/a&gt; site, and come visit us for future events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a great Darwin Day, whatever you do...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Karen Stollznow</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.baskeptics.org/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.baskeptics.org/rss.xml</id><title type="html">Bay Area Skeptics</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.baskeptics.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234080084012"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-2274441768076540883">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf44834ffa9d08ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Antony Flew&amp;#39;s Parable of the Invisible Gardener</title><published>2009-02-08T06:22:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T14:41:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/534681171/antony-flews-parable-of-invisible.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/2274441768076540883/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=2274441768076540883" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/antony-flews-parable-of-invisible.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/flew_falsification.html"&gt;This is a classic parable&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gene that helped one species split into two species shows evidence of adapting much faster than other genes in the genome, raising questions about what is driving its rapid evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper in the Feb 5 issue of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; shows that the gene has connections to another previously identified “speciation gene.” Both genes code for key proteins that control molecular traffic into and out of a cell’s nucleus. The researchers believe an arms race of sorts inside the cell drives these genes to evolve rapidly—and as a consequence makes closely related species genetically incompatible with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I attended a Darwin 200 event today (even though Darwin Day is technically on Feb. 12) and rang in Darwin’s bicentennial with his great, great grandson Mathew Chapman, it’s only appropriate that I should post this evolutionary news item.&lt;/p&gt;

His 1998 study that “implicated” MMR vaccines as the cause of autism was discredited many years ago but he continued to sell the message that vaccines were the enemy. Of course others jumped on his bandwagon and as MMR vaccines became completely exonerated it became necessary to expand the claims to keep the movement alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until now, it was still possible that Wakefield was just an idiot who stood behind his own horribly designed study. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/why_am_i_not_surprised_it_looks_as_thoug.php#more"&gt;But now that may all change&lt;/a&gt;. A new &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;article published in &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Wakefield’s nemesis Brian Deer makes  allegations that if true mean that Wakefield is more than just a shitty scientist but actually a deliberate fraud who actually falsified his data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is true then Andrew Wakefield is an evil monster who I think deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail for his crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, on second thought, Wakefield deserves no pity. After all, he is the man who almost single-handedly launched the scare over the MMR vaccine in Britain when he published his infamous &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper in 1998&lt;/a&gt; in which he claimed to have linked the MMR vaccine to regressive autism and inflammation of the colon, a study that was followed up four years later with a &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11950955?ordinalpos=7&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that claimed to have found the strain of attenuated measles virus in the MMR in the colons of autistic children by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It would be one thing if these studies were sound science. If that were the case, then Wakefield's work would have been very important and would have correctly cast doubt on the safety of the MMR. Unfortunately, they were not, and, indeed, most of the authors of the 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper later withdrew their names from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, aided and abetted by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/help_ben_goldacre.php"&gt;useful idiots in the media&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/08/the-medias-mmr-hoax/"&gt;British newspapers and other media&lt;/a&gt; that sensationalized the story, and the antivaccine movement, which hailed Wakefield as a hero, Wakefield managed to drive MMR vaccination rates in the U.K. below the level of herd immunity, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;from 93% to 75%&lt;/a&gt; (and as low as 50% in some parts of London). As a result, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;I "thanked" Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; for his leadership role in bringing the measles back to the U.K. to the point where, fourteen years after measles had been declared under control in the U.K., it was in 2008 &lt;a href="http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18919"&gt;declared endemic again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, this fear was based on the worst science. First, no scientist not associated with Andrew Wakefield has ever been able to replicate his work. Second, as was exposed by U.K. reporter &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield-deer.htm"&gt;Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt;, not only was Wakefield &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;paid big bucks by trial lawyers&lt;/a&gt; seeking to sue vaccine manufacturers for "vaccine injury" to do his studies on autistic children, a conflict of interest he never revealed and that had to be exposed through Deer's investigations, but months before he published his &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper Wakefield had applied for a &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/wakefield-patents.htm"&gt;patent on a an allegedly safer single measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that could succeed best if the safety of the MMR were called into doubt. Even after all of this came to light, leading to Wakefield's correctly being dragged in front of the General Medical Council for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/while_were_on_the_topic_of_aut.php"&gt;charges of scientific misconduct&lt;/a&gt;. Even after this, he still enjoys a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/07/as_if_there_were_any_doubt_about_the_cul.php"&gt;cult of personality&lt;/a&gt; that I can't figure out, and is often portrayed as being "persecuted" by the British medical establishment. Third, was revealed at the Autism Omnibus proceedings when PCR expert Stephen Bustin testified about the shoddy methods at the laboratory used to do the PCR on the colon biopsies. In brief, the laboratory used was set up such that cross contamination between the plasmids used to maintain the measles virus sequences and the area where the PCR was done. PCR is very sensitive; if there is contaminating plasmid sequence, it is very easy to amplify and detect it even when there is nothing in your samples. Indeed, I've experienced this very problem on occasion in my own lab. Unfortunately, in the case of Wakefield's research, no controls were done to make sure that contamination was detected in the negative controls. Finally, Wakefield's results were roundly refuted in an attempt to replicate his work that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/09/yet_another_really_bad_day_for_antivacci_1.php"&gt;was published last year&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see, Wakefield's work and ethics are about as bad as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought, until readers started sending me &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;this article published in &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, again by Wakefield's nemesis Brian Deer.

I don’t doubt that that’s part of it, but I’m not convinced it’s the major differentiator. I think the reason those two topics get participants so worked up is that other people’s opinions, unlike most topics, have a material impact on our lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If two people disagree over how long to bake a cake, it’s not a big deal because both can simply ignore the other and bake theirs the way they always have. The result of any argument that could possibly arise is relatively insignificant to both parties. Change the argument to whether or not the government should spend $800 billion buying up toxic mortgage-backed instruments from banks, and now we’re talking about something that could have broad ramifications on our lives going forward, and the party whose argument loses has to live with the results, good or bad, just as much as the one that comes out the victor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I showed in my popular post &lt;a href="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=258"&gt;Why Anti-God Books Sell Well&lt;/a&gt; religion is an even clearer case than politics in this regard, at least in my country where separation of church and state is still largely fiction. Pretend for a moment that you’re an atheist. Here are some ways other people’s religious views have affected you over the last 8 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. George W. Bush got elected twice with the swing vote being cast by the religious right. I’ll leave whether or not this was a good thing up to the reader (though I’ll assure you that you’ll have an easier time finding a unicorn than an atheist Bush supporter) but suffice it to say, the result had a tremendous effect an all Americans, most of whom, according to polling data, consider it largely negative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. George W. Bush has stymied stem cell research, by executive order, arguably the most promising avenue of medical progress, for the last 8 years. Remember, for this thought experiment you’re an atheist, so you don’t have any religious problem with using frozen embryos that would otherwise have been destroyed anyway to attempt to cure horrible diseases like cancer and MS. You may be a libertarian or just general free-market capitalist and therefore opposed to any government-sponsored scientific funding, but Bush didn’t cut that off, he just diverted it away from stem cell research to other things by effectively banning it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if stem cell research delivers on even a fraction of its promise, Bush’s delay, caused by his religious belief that life begins at conception, effectively prevented science from saving potentially millions of lives. If it set research back, say, 4 years total, and that research one day cures breast cancer, then everyone who died in the 4 years before the cure is finalized would not have if not for Bush’s religious beliefs. (I realize I’m greatly oversimplifying the way science in general and stem cell research in particular works here for the sake of expediency, but you get what I mean.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Voters’ religious views have denied gays the right to marry in most of the country. Again, you’re an atheist for this thought experiment, so you don’t have any divine book telling you homosexuality is a sin, so it seems to you like a rather straightforward case of denying people their basic rights. (If atheist Bush supporters are hard to come by, try finding ones opposed to gay marriage.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are just a quick three off the top of my head. The point is that the religious beliefs of the majority of voters have incredibly strong effects on everyone else. The baking practices of everyone else have absolutely no bearing on my corn muffins. (Thank God too, because my corn muffins are amazing.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a somewhat testable hypothesis. If I’m correct, what you’d see is that politics lead to heated arguments everywhere (check) and that religion tends to do so at least somewhat less frequently in areas with greater separation of church and state. The former is clearly true, the latter has been as well in my highly unscientific observation. I’ve generally seen Europeans appear to be much less uptight about the topic, except where Islam is concerned in some nations that have experienced significant terrorism, but that’s something entirely different.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be interesting to post the same religious threads in forums and social news sites frequented predominantly by Western Europeans, then do the same in American ones, then somehow try to measure the amount of animosity. It’s a tough job (especially since Europeans are often so well-mannered and seemingly calm when arguing relative to us brutish Americans) but I’d love to see the results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234073368853"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/incendiary_weekend_post_on_blo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc3dab1ccbc5472b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Incendiary weekend post on bloggers vs. journalists</title><published>2009-02-08T05:45:45Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T05:45:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/1-4VwE_tENQ/incendiary_weekend_post_on_blo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/incendiary_weekend_post_on_blo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I see news on MSM I check with trusted bloggers if the news is to be believed. Trusted bloggers? Takes time and work to find out who.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I automatically do NOT believe anything coming from corporate media. I check blogs to see what they say if I catch some news on MSM first (rarely these days). Some blogs can be trusted 100% of the time, some 90%, some occasionally, some never. It takes time and effort to figure out who is who, but that effort is worth it - you get immunized from MSM lies. You also learn the skills of critically reading between the lines of MSM and evaluating their "news" for accuracy and validity yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you always check a multitude of trusted bloggers, never just one, no matter how trusted. So, why should people trust a single MSM source? Beats me! I don't even trust the multitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some blogs are just for entertainment, filling the function of comics pages in the newspaper. Usually funnier than Family Circus. Not everything is politics. That's perfectly OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, collections of bloggers and all of their readers put together can organize actions that have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php" title=""&gt;real-world power&lt;/a&gt;. And that is just the &lt;a href="http://www.winextra.com/index.php/2009/02/07/blogging-hasnt-even-begun-to-scratch-the-surface/" title=""&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/incendiary_weekend_post_on_blo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/1-4VwE_tENQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234073368853"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a4ba0675711ce81</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Who has power?</title><published>2009-02-08T04:38:12Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T04:38:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ohyuolAi1eI/who_has_power.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Who has power? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elected officials: they write, vote for and sign laws, they decide how much money will be collected from whom and how it will be spent, they decide on starting and stopping wars, i.e., lives and deaths of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who else has power? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who can affect the decision of an elected official, e.g., to change a vote from Yes to No or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one do that? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By having money and using it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one use money to affect policy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One: by directly lobbying the elected officials. Two: by buying off the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand how One works, but Two? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elected officials think that the press reflects the thinking of the people. Afraid of losing re-election, they will do what the people say to them via media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the media does not reflect what people think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correct, but elected officials did not know this until recently, and thus used the press as a proxy to get information about the popular sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But didn't constituents always have the ability to contact their representatives directly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, but most don't know this fact, and very few use the opportunity. One constituent letter has no power in comparison to the strength of all the national media outlets. And often constituents are not aware that their opinion on a matter is not unique, so they are shy about voicing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, money wins.  What can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is changing. When a senatorial office cannot do any business because their phones are ringing off the hook continuously for several days, their faxes are clogged, their e-mail inboxes are full of thousands of messages, and their mail is brought into the office in large bags or boxes, all of them from constituents, all asking the elected official to change the vote from Yes to No, they perk up and pay attention.  This is a completely new and surprising level of constituent interest that baffles them.  But they listen. And they tend to do what their constituents tell them. Sooner or later they will realize that what press is saying has nothing to do with what citizens really want. The press has lost all its credibility with the people, it is now also slowly losing credibility with the people in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing has already happened a number of times over the past couple of years. Laws have been passed or blocked because of such concerted action.  People won or lost elections due to having a tin ear or not when voters chimed in on their office telephones.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But where did that action come from? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From organized groups of people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did they get organized?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found out about each others' existence online, realized they are not alone or in a minority, they built their own communities online (mostly on blogs, but also forums, mailing groups, social networks...), and this is where they organized the actions. From outside, it looks like a handful of bloggers incited a citizen revolt.  But from the inside, it is the citizens who organized themselves using those blogs as tools.  Bloggers are not Martians who just fell on Earth.  Bloggers are citizens, silent until now. Popular blogs are just tip of the iceberg - the community boards for citizen organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is not the source of power any more, or at least not as much as it used to be, and it is going to be so more and more in the future. If an elected official gets money from a lobbyist one day for the Yes vote, and gets 10,000 calls from constituents next day for the No vote - who is he going to listen to if he wants to get re-elected?  If he has any brains, he will listen to the voters. Voters will vote next time, voters will fund the campaign as much as necessary, and voters never forget.  Lobbyists can shove it. Easy arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrelevant any more. Citizens discovered a way to find information outside of press. Using this information, those same citizens discovered a way to go directly to elected officials to exert their influence. And not listening to them always incurs a steep price at the polls later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, why have money any more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To have a place to live in, to have food, clothes, hobbies, travel the world, learn.... It is not money that will be the source of power in the future, but the strength of the community you belong to - how many people you know (and they know you) who hold the same beliefs as you and are willing to perform necessary action as needed.  That is the source of power in the future. Networking, not hogging money. A large network of people will both, as a collective, have more money than a single entity, and will also need less money to achieve the goal in the first place as they can keep their elected officials hostages - as the Founders envisioned - just by being organized and vocal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ohyuolAi1eI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234072389450"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/radio_reminder_47.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a742929559a0ffd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Radio reminder</title><published>2009-02-08T04:13:15Z</published><updated>2009-02-08T04:13:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/cAQK3CNVq4Q/radio_reminder_47.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/radio_reminder_47.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning at 9am Central, tune in to &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/content/view/260/1/"&gt;Atheist talk radio&lt;/a&gt; for a pre-Darwin Day discussion.

We would put two terms together, such as health and cigarettes, and say, for example, "If I could only have one, I would pick health", or "I like or prefer this over that".  Then we would look at examples of behavior of the person and see if it matched the values. I think this and a few other thinking skills should be taught in school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some Books Where The Process Of Assessing Values Turns Up In Different Contexts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past few months I've stumbled onto some books that have reminded me of some of the exercises we performed in those seminars.  Three in particular are&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"The Thinkers Toolkit" by Morgan D. Jones&lt;br&gt;"How To Measure Anything" by Douglas W. Hubbard&lt;br&gt;"How To Solve It" by George Polya &lt;/i&gt;(if you read the other two you don't need this one.  However as far as I can see, it was the first to detail a specific model for problem solving in mathematics which has since been adapted to other contexts such as the first two books).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start By Defining Terms, Defining The Problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, in order to do the exercise you have to define those terms.  Defining terms such as Good, Bad, Love, Health, Wealth, Success, Peace, Happiness are hard to do because they are subjective, however,  common denominators can be found within a range of answers from a range of people and a set of minimum criteria can be derived.  But this exercise is not only good for identifying where ones values do not correlate to ones behavior, it is also good for decision making.  Its called "Weighted Ranking" and while it is true that this method has its limitations, when the right context arises, it is a powerful tool. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;It can be used in evaluating how you really feel about something or someone which is useful in a real world context such as assessing the performance of employees or screening resumes for interviews.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setting Up The Context Of The Exercise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a silly example off the top of my head of how to do the exercise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ted has Diabetes and is overweight.  He is out to lunch with friends and they are ordering the type of meals that Ted should not eat.  He really wants to share the four cheese pizza with his friends but instead he thinks about what he wants out of life, what his hierarchy of values are and he orders the salad instead.  Of course, one of his friends tries to pressure him to conform and eat the pizza too, but he politely declines. Another friend doesn't have as much money as they thought and Ted offers to pay the difference.  When they leave the restaurant its raining and Ted offers his coat to a female friend wearing a sleeveless blouse.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does this relate to Christianity? Thomas Bayes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has to do with defining terms, organizing an hierarchy of values and evaluating behavior. Thomas Bayes (1702-1761), a British mathematician, statistician and religious leader, identified and defined an algorithm for the process of belief that seems to be innate in humans.  It goes something like the following.&lt;br&gt;"The probability or likelihood of A given B, C, D, E, F is...."&lt;br&gt;It doesn't have to be plugged into a mathematical formula, in fact that is not how it is used most of the time.  We use it instinctively when deciding what we think about things every day all day.  So lets apply it to how we should feel about Ted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, how should we feel about Ted?  Should Ted be characterized as a "Good Person"?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My definition of a "good person" is .......(write them down). &lt;br&gt;Is Teds behavior consistent with what I think a good person is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The likelihood of Ted being a "good person" given&lt;br&gt;* He chose the salad&lt;br&gt;* He politely declined when pressured&lt;br&gt;* He payed the difference in the check&lt;br&gt;* He gives his coat to his friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;is high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Information About Ted!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The next time we see Ted, he calls Joe at six am on Friday and asks him to swing by on the way to work and pick him up.  Ted said he is running late and asks Joe to park the car and come up to the apartment.  When Joe gets there he finds that the fender and wheel of Teds car is damaged such that it can't be driven.  When he gets up to the apartment Joe finds that the apartment smells like bourbon, the Dog is so thin his bones are showing, the apartment smells like dog urine, there are old dirty dishes in the sink, and Ted is just getting into the shower.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The likelihood of Ted being a "good person" given the new information&lt;br&gt;* He chose the salad&lt;br&gt;* He politely declined when pressured&lt;br&gt;* He payed the difference in the check&lt;br&gt;* He gives his coat to his friend.&lt;br&gt;* Teds car is damaged such that it can't be driven.  &lt;br&gt;* The apartment smells like bourbon,&lt;br&gt;* The Dog is so thin his bones are showing,&lt;br&gt;* The apartment smells like dog urine,&lt;br&gt;* There are old dirty dishes in the sink, and&lt;br&gt;* Ted is just getting in the shower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;is not as high as it was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ted probably has personal problems and needs some help, but this forces a re-evaluation of Ted and tightening up of a definition of what a "Good Person" is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I think where God is concerned, in Christians,  this process is interrupted.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;They will say that God is Good and Loving EVEN given examples of behavior that would reduce their esteem of a loved one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example of this is that fact that supposedly God created Adam and Eve, which means he decided how we would turn out, then when Adam and Eve disobeyed, He kicked them out of their home and put them in the wilderness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now if my brother kicked his teenage son and daughter out of the house for disobedience,  that would reduce my confidence in his judgment and I would try to convince him that he made a mistake.  I think most  compassionate people would.  But when it comes to God, this principle doesn't apply.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The honest compassionate person when reading through the Bible should see this and other behaviors by God as DISCONFIRMING EVIDENCE that God uses good judgment. If a soldier returns from war and we are told that he cut the baby out of the womb of a mother at the order of his commanding officer, both the officer and the soldier would likely go to court martial justifiably.  Yet, God is forgiven of this atrocity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;So lets try it out.  Lets do a value system exercise and see how our values correlate to our behavior.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lets define what we think a good person is and come up with a list.  We can define a range of characteristics for what a good person is. In the case that the person contradicts the characteristics by their behavior, their "goodness rating" will decrease.  Now think of examples of Gods behavior in the Bible and list them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please come up with your own lists, and I invite you to post them in the comments for future reference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now try the following.&lt;br&gt;1. Is God a Person?  Well, at least the song says he is: "God in three persons, blessed trinity!"&lt;br&gt;2. My idea of a Good person is....&lt;br&gt;3. Is Gods behavior consistent with what I think a good person is?&lt;br&gt;4. The likelihood that God is a good person given&lt;br&gt;* instance 1.&lt;br&gt;* instance 2.&lt;br&gt;* instance 3.&lt;br&gt;is [fill in the blank].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on my experience here over the past two years and seeing Christians put into this corner, I think this exercise will elicit cognitive dissonance and they will either refuse to do it, or begin special pleading about why it doesn't apply to God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'll expect them to say that we cannot judge God by human standards.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have seen them say that God is good regardless.  That he has a reason for his actions we just don't have access to what it is.  We don't know what his reasons are.  We are agnostic for his reasons but the Bible tells us he's good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to them I'll say, "Lets try a little exercise!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;If we are made in the image of God, what does that mean? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should mean that we should have some things in common with God!&lt;br&gt;Come up with a list or characteristics that Humans have in common with God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The likelihood that we are made in Gods image given....&lt;br&gt;* We can't understand his behavior&lt;br&gt;* A lot of Gods action don't fall into our definition of behaviors of a good person&lt;br&gt;* [fill in the blank]&lt;br&gt;* [fill in the blank]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;is [fill in the blank]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I would argue that not only does science funding directly translate into cash infusions into the economy (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/03/even-more-on-the-stimulus/"&gt;much more effectively than tax cuts, for example&lt;/a&gt;), but it also helps &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11463"&gt;boost the economy over the longer term&lt;/a&gt; (which is arguably just as important). Mark Westneat, Pritzker Director of the Biodiversity Synthesis Center at the Field Museum in Chicago, has written a nice piece addressing the &lt;a href="http://sefora.org/2009/02/06/science-is-the-real-deal-for-economic-stimulus/"&gt;immediate stimulus from science funding&lt;/a&gt;. As he puts it, “scientific research is basically all about hiring people and buying stuff”.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, the decisions by these &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"&gt;100 individuals&lt;/a&gt; will have tremendous repercussions, not only this year, but potentially for the foreseeable future (since they set the tone for science spending in an era of immense budgetary pressure). &lt;/p&gt;

The original crew of me, Pinky, and Eib was shortened to me and Eib when Pinky became bitchlike and pussed out. Eib and I have been diligently searching for Bigfoot and documenting our adventuresome exploits on low-resolution digital video all across the Hoosier state. So far, we have learned a few things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) I have a knack for picking delicious and awesome places to eat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Driving really isn't a chore when the trip is actually more important than the destination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) McCormick Creek State Park is a really awesome place that I need to come back to during the summer or fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And last but not least,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) In Indiana, the boondocks &lt;i&gt;have boondocks&lt;/i&gt;. You wouldn't believe some of the dueling banjos shit that we saw today. You, too, however, will see it when I cut together our footage and put it up on YouTube.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have we found Bigfoot?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, as far as Eib's girlfriend is concerned, we caught him and tied him to the hood of the car, but then he escaped while we were filling up on gas, and we chased him all the way to Louisville, Kentucky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as we're concerned...Drum roll please...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course not!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've seen neither hide nor hair of anything even remotely bigfootlike as yet. Though we did see some impressions in the snow that looked remarkably like giant footprints. No kidding. You'll have to wait for the video to see them, though. Hopefully that will be done Monday night.

&lt;p&gt;Adams originally plead not guilty, but prosecutors threatened to add fraud charges on behalf of two other victims, and Adams agreed to accept a jail term of up to six years and to make restitution to all three victims.  The case filed against her involved an elderly woman who gave Adams $80,330 based on promises that it would keep the victim's husband from dying, and would avert harm to other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;cite&gt;Oakland Tribune&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of victims approached police after Adams' Dec. 18 arrest, but prosecutors could only press charges in cases with "intrinsic fraud," [San Mateo County Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve] Wagstaffe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When you get a quid pro quo — 'your husband will die if you don't give me money,' what she's saying is, 'I will prevent it from happening,' and that's the falsehood," Wagstaffe said. "She can't prevent the husband from dying in two weeks unless she has some powers we don't know about."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that was the case, "she probably wouldn't have pleaded no contest," Wagstaffe added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Byers, Adams' attorney, took a less skeptical attitude, saying Adams changed her plea because "she wanted to take responsibility for her actions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She feels bad for the harm she has caused," Byers said. "She's upset that she has kind of dragged other fortune tellers through the mud, and their names were hurt."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adams previously spent two years in jail and paid $22,000 in restitution for fraud while telling fortunes at the Half Moon Bay pumpkin fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;cite&gt;Tribune&lt;/cite&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dianna Czellecz, one of the women who went to police after Adams' arrest, said the psychic took at least $1,000 from her while she battled alcoholism last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Czellecz said news of Adams' plea gave her "the chills in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to have a really good weekend now," Czellecz said.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite involving just a dozen children, the 1998 paper's impact was extraordinary. After its publication, rates of inoculation fell from 92% to below 80%. Populations acquire "herd immunity" from measles when more than 95% of people have been vaccinated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Last week official figures showed that 1,348 confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales were reported last year, compared with 56 in 1998. Two children have died of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for some shocking news — it looks like the &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;data may have been faked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in February 1998 in an article in The Lancet medical journal. It claimed that the families of eight out of 12 children attending a routine clinic at the hospital had blamed MMR for their autism, and said that problems came on within days of the jab. The team also claimed to have discovered a new inflammatory bowel disease underlying the children's conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, our investigation, confirmed by evidence presented to the General Medical Council (GMC), reveals that: In most of the 12 cases, the children's ailments as described in The Lancet were different from their hospital and GP records. Although the research paper claimed that problems came on within days of the jab, in only one case did medical records suggest this was true, and in many of the cases medical concerns had been raised before the children were vaccinated. Hospital pathologists, looking for inflammatory bowel disease, reported in the majority of cases that the gut was normal. This was then reviewed and the Lancet paper showed them as abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this revelation matter? Not one bit. The anti-vaxers have ignored all the evidence that they are wrong so far, so one more demonstration that one of the primary promulgators of this nonsense was an outright fraud won't change a thing, I'm afraid. This is still a clear-cut case where delusions can kill.&lt;/p&gt;

I had to check it out because the "Dr." in question was one Susan Walker, ND and the question revolved around the issue of detoxification.  Would Ms. Walker buck my expectations and tell the layperson the truth as far as we know it, or would she turn it into a shitty, smarmy, ignorant sales pitch?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're reading this on my site, I think you know the answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She said the following in her piece:&lt;blockquote&gt;"...new research is emerging showing that toxins disrupt key mechanisms involved in the regulation of weight and that you could be overweight because you are not detoxifying properly."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We live in a toxic environment; this is quite clear."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Toxic chemicals are usually stored in the body in fat tissue, organs and bone and can have detrimental effects on almost every system in the body."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"...detoxification is central to long-term health and effective weight loss.&lt;/blockquote&gt;She referenced the &lt;a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=55204"&gt;&lt;i&gt;National Human Adipose Tissue Survey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as a U Weight Loss (a product/process that she offers).  In case you were wondering what the "3 Simple Secrets" of U Weight Loss are, well, &lt;a href="http://www.uweightloss.com/3secrets.aspx"&gt;look no further&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you'll check out that page quickly and look at secret number one, it says, &lt;i&gt;"free your body of toxins and cravings"&lt;/i&gt;.  What?  Both toxins &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; cravings?  That's just craziness.  From Ms. Susan's article, you'd think there's a ton of science-based, blinded, peer-reviewed research to back up her adipose studies and such.  Sadly, not so much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (NHATS) only lists the chemicals that have been found in the adipose tissue of cadavers.  The U Weight Loss assholes and the "detox" dipshits take that information and assume that these chemicals are at harmful levels, THEN they claim specific health detriments (weight gain, for example) that result from those harmful levels, THEN they claim that their stupid programs can remove the supposed toxins from your body, thus reversing all the ill-effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone see a problem?  If you'd like to get the skinny on why "detox" programs are silly, just go to Brian Dunning's great site, &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4083"&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/a&gt; - better yet, subscribe to his podcast on iTunes or something.  Ten to twelve minutes a week to make you a more informed consumer is well worth the time investment.  At the very least, it's better than a visit to Dr. Susan who either has no idea how your body works or, more nefariously, knows exactly how your body works but doesn't care and only wants you to empty your wallet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope for the former.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

The Sunday &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;Times Online&lt;/a&gt; reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confidential medical documents and interviews with witnesses have established that Andrew Wakefield manipulated patients’ data, which triggered fears that the MMR triple vaccine to protect against measles, mumps and rubella was linked to the condition.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evidence [presented to the GMC], combined with unprecedented access to medical records, a mass of confidential documents and cooperation from parents during an investigation by this newspaper, has shown the selective reporting and changes to findings that allowed a link between MMR and autism to be asserted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wakefield is currently under investigation by the GMC on charges of medical ethics violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were only twelve children in the study, the impact of the 1998 paper have been enormous, with rates of vaccination falling from 92% to below 80% in the UK; the US experiencing its &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/at-least-72-measles-cases-in-the-us/"&gt;largest outbreak of measles since 2001&lt;/a&gt; in 2008; and parents of children fearful of vaccinating their children, due to a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/now_how_can_people_believe_that_about_vaccines"&gt;misinformed belief&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines or something in vaccines could be linked to autism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago, Wakefield published a study dealing with children who were autistic, developing symptoms shortly after getting their shots, and linked this with irritated intestinal tracts. This study came under a lot of fire, and eventually &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_enterocolitis#.22Retraction_of_an_interpretation.22"&gt;most of the authors retracted the conclusion&lt;/a&gt; that autism was associated with &amp;quot;environmental factors&amp;quot;, that is, vaccinations. By then, though, it was too late, and the modern antivaccination movement was born. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sunday Times investigated Wakefield’s original research, and alleges that the symptoms Wakefield reports in his research do not match hospital records of the 12 children studied at the time. In only one case were there symptoms that arose after the injection; in many of the other cases symptoms started &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the children had been vaccinated (in fact, there have been allegations for some time that neurological issues occurred in the children before they had actually been vaccinated, casting doubt on Wakefield’s work). Also, hospital pathologists reported that the bowels of many of the children were normal, but Wakefield reported them as having inflammatory disease in his journal paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these allegations are true, then it means that Wakefield out-and-out lied in his original work. He has denied this, according to the Sunday Times, but won’t make further comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may cause a firestorm in the antivax community, but there are two things I will guarantee: the first is that in the end antivaxxers will stick to their beliefs that vaccines cause health problems like autism, because this is not and never has been, for them, about the facts and evidence. It’s a belief system, and like most other belief systems, it is impenetrable to evidence. If you have any doubts, I suggest you &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/06/uk-in-trouble-measles-antivax-garbage-on-the-rise/"&gt;read the comments to the post I made the other day about measles being on the rise in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. One commenter on that post is saying all manners of outrageous things, and ignores the evidence that I (and a pediatrician) have left in the comments to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, and somewhat related, &lt;em&gt;this hardly matters&lt;/em&gt;. Many, many independent tests have shown that vaccines are unrelated to the onset of autism. There is vast evidence that vaccines are very safe, and what small risk they pose is massively outweighed by the good they do. Whether Wakefield faked his results or not, &lt;strong&gt;he’s still wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that if this pans out, then perhaps there will be a net loss of people from the antivax side of the argument. The ones who are true believers won’t waver in their faith, of course, but anyone with doubts may finally see reality for the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be very interested indeed on following this story. If anyone finds more information, please send it along. &lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="http://skittlesupdate.blogspot.com/"&gt;young boy is battling leukemia&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href="http://skittlesupdate.blogspot.com/2009/02/as-you-may-have-noticed-we-have-added.html"&gt;family is struggling with the costs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we know now is that early intervention and early treatment will help by the time an autistic child reaches eighth grade," said Harden, a Republican from District 7. "It's just really key to their progression and their performance as they get into adulthood. It can make a huge difference if we do this early."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the bills pass, it could affect UNM, as the number of autistic students attending the University has tripled in the past two years, said Joan Green, director of the Accessibility Resource Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Any legislative package that is going to be helping with intervention and early proactive things is going to ultimately be positive for us as well," Green said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harden's bills call for Medicaid coverage for early diagnostics and intervention for children through age five, a health insurance mandate to cover autism treatment for children through high school and an autism registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd even say that, while we do know much more about early intervention and educational programs for preschool and elementary aged students on the spectrum, we still need to know much more about students at the intermediate level, at the middle school level, at the high school level, at the college level, and after, and at each transition from one level to the next.  In the case of my son Charlie---even though we felt confused and uncertain about what to do after he was &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; in 1999----what sorts of school programs and how to teach him have been even more difficult to discern as he gets older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all heard the phrase "if you've met one person on the spectrum, you've met one person on the spectrum." Charlie's in a public school autism program created and overseen by a number of professionals (specifically, behavior analysts, psychologists, and teachers with a background in more than "special education") in teaching autistic students. It's taken months to help him &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;transition&lt;/a&gt; and some days have been as tough as the time when he was first getting diagnosed, with Jim and me looking some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;very hard questions&lt;/a&gt; in the face. After some miscommunications earlier this year, we've been working hard to work in partnership in all respects with Charlie's teacher and all those professionals and, after an emergency IEP meeting the week before last, this past week was much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a long road ahead; even after we get through the murky difficulties of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt;, they'll be the transition to high school, and then to a job and the end of school, and then to finding a place for Charlie to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you live in New Jersey, please complete the &lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=x33lcx4bxbMZ6Bwm55ApOQ_3d_3d"&gt;online survey&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href="http://www.politickernj.com/voss-schaer-mckeon-adults-autism-task-force-bill-signed-law-11679"&gt;New Jersey Adults with Autism Task Force&lt;/a&gt; (NJAATF), if you haven't yet. Wherever you live, take a look at what your state or region has (or doesn't have) in regard to supports and services for adults on the spectrum. Certainly my son, all of us, are adults for much longer than we are children and that's why we need to think ahead and think proactively, today and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what Nick Perry, a junior majoring in Urban Studies at San Francisco State University says in today's &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/06/BAH015KH3P.DTL"&gt;SF Gate&lt;/a&gt; (Perry was diagnosed with autism when he was five years old):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not easy. It is difficult to stay on task, but I think I'm handling it................I like to learn. I've gotten in the swing of things. The next big transition will be moving from the university, to getting a job and supporting myself. I want to do big things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For this, among other infractions of convention, he has been &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090206.wprof06/BNStory/National/home"&gt;suspended with pay from his teaching position pending institutional review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Rancourt's suspension is the most serious step in a long series of grievances and conflicts with the university dating back to 2005, when, after researching new teaching methods, he first experimented with eliminating letter grades. He also altered course curriculum with student input - although not the approval of the university - an approach he calls "academic squatting."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A well-published and politically outspoken scientist who revels in hashing out theories on napkins at conferences, Prof. Rancourt's unconventional teaching style has generated both an ardent following among a core group of students, and the rancour of many of his fellow faculty members, one-third of whom signed a petition of complaint against him in the fall of 2007. In the letter, which he provided, the complaints stem largely from a series of critical e-mails he distributed about their "paternalistic" teaching methods - a criticism he still expresses, with little restraint, today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I have to say that what he proposes actually sounds cool and interesting, and that I&amp;#39;d have to see a lot more information before I could say whether the suspension was warranted or not. Grades are a pain and sometimes an obstacle to real learning, and sometimes they are a crutch — a whip we use to motivate when we can&amp;#39;t get the students excited about a subject. I think that one of the things tenured professors ought to be able to do is experiment and innovate in their teaching. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are two potential problems. One is that sometimes innovation &lt;i&gt;doesn't work&lt;/i&gt; — if you&amp;#39;re going to experiment, sometimes experiments fail. The article doesn&amp;#39;t say whether there was some objective assessment of the outcomes of his classes. Do his students actually come out the other side of the term with him with more knowledge and understanding? If they do, bugger the objections, let him keep at it. If they don&amp;#39;t, and the university is actually complaining that he is ignoring the assessment of his experiments to keep doing stuff that doesn&amp;#39;t work, then goodbye Professor Rancourt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem is that a university education is not the product of a single instructor, and we &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; respect the whole of the curriculum and work together with our colleagues. I rely on other faculty to teach our students cell biology and molecular biology, for instance; if students showed up in my upper level elective courses with the expectation that they'd learn some developmental biology, and I discovered that they knew nothing about those foundational subjects because their instructors had decided that they'd teach philosophy and political science instead (something I know they wouldn't do), &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; would be screwed, and more than a little upset. I&amp;#39;d like to know how far he deviated from the course curricula…a little flexibility is good, but if he was ignoring the needs of the whole discipline&amp;#39;s program, then that&amp;#39;s also reason to say bye-bye to Rancourt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/shhhh_dont_tell_the_students.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/CmYVmkFIKeM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234040392723"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-1057386401876177181">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5a03b1b81959191d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">American stimulus package gutted of science.</title><published>2009-02-07T19:16:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-07T19:20:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/02/american-stimulus-package-gutted-of.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=1057386401876177181" title="5 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Of the &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/07/stimulus.cuts/index.html"&gt;many things cut&lt;/a&gt; from the revised American stimulus package...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $75 million from Smithsonian (original bill $150 million)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $200 million from Environmental Protection Agency Superfund (original bill $800 million)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $100 million from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (original bill $427 million)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $65 million for watershed rehabilitation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $50 million for aquaculture&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $2 billion for broadband&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $50 million for NASA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $50 million for aeronautics&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $200 million for National Science Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $100 million for science&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $25 million for Fish and Wildlife&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• $3.5 billion for higher education construction&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Well, it was a nice dream while it lasted.</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234037172108"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5906">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f01e4f45cf780da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 2.7</title><published>2009-02-07T20:00:39Z</published><updated>2009-02-07T20:00:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5906" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll warn you in advance, this one is a bit heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I found out that an acquaintance of mine from high school suffered a sudden and unexpected heart attack (at age 31) and the doctors weren’t able to save her.  She comes from a religious background, so it didn’t surprise me that the well-wishes on the website they set up for her were overflowing with people saying they were praying for the family, or that she is in a better place now; all the usual Christian ways of coping with a death and comforting the family.  I realize that this is how they contextualize it and try to make it alright, even if I might find it a bit sad and empty…they’re doing what they have to to move on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me wonder if nonbelievers do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you think about death?  Is there any line of thinking that you find comforting?  Do you think we should seek comfort after the death of a loved one, or does that somehow diminish the loss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234037143357"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/07/carnival-of-space-3/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cebc4652312c31b6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Carnival of Space</title><published>2009-02-07T19:59:04Z</published><updated>2009-02-07T19:59:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/07/carnival-of-space-3/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The latest Carnival of Space is now live at &lt;a href="http://www.moonsociety.org/blog/index.php/2009/02/07/carnival-of-the-space-geeks-the-lunar-ed"&gt;The Moon Society Blog&lt;/a&gt;.

Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. On the &lt;a href="http://education.change.org"&gt;Education&lt;/a&gt; cause blog, &lt;a href="http://education.change.org/actions/view/gop_dont_gut_60_billion_for_education_from_the_stimulus_package"&gt;GOP: Don't Gut $60+ Billion for Education from the Stimulus Package&lt;/a&gt;.  This action is related to Kristina's post on Friday, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/proposed_funding_for_idea_to_be_halved"&gt;Proposed Funding for Idea to Be Halved&lt;/a&gt;.  Make sure special education remains funded!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Also on the Education blog, tell your policy makers to &lt;a href="http://education.change.org/actions/view/appoint_linda_darling-hammond_to_a_top_doe_job"&gt;Appoint Linda Darling-Hammond to a Top DOE Job&lt;/a&gt;.  This action is related to my post from yesterday, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_education_and_the_law_interview_2_with_jennifer_parker"&gt;Special Education and the Law&lt;/a&gt;.  Darling-Hammond is a strong supporter of reform that would be of benefit to special education and kids with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Right here, I've put up a new pledge to sign a petition to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/make_wendy_portillo_accountable_of_emotional_abuse"&gt;Make Wendy Portillo Accountable of Emotional Abuse&lt;/a&gt;.  Portillo thought she was teaching consequences for actions by having classmates vote and autistic boy out of the classroom, but apparently she feels the same lesson does not apply to her.  Kristina's post on the latest on Portillo: &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/should_wendy_portillo_still_be_teaching"&gt;Should Wendy Portillo Still Be Teaching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. If you haven't taken action against Action for Children's Monstrous Media yet, please both &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/autisticadvocacy/actions/view/action_for_children_unethical_ad_campaign_alert"&gt;tell Action for Children&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/actions/action_sign_up?change_id=2705&amp;amp;event_id=19535"&gt;tell the Advertising Standards Authority&lt;/a&gt; that demonizing autistic people is not acceptable in the mainstream media.  &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/my_son_is_not_a_monster"&gt;Kristina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_more_monstrous_messages"&gt;Dora&lt;/a&gt; have both written about this during the past week, it's been denounced by &lt;a href="http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2009/01/attwood-speaks-monster-ad-slammed.html"&gt;Tony Attwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2009/02/monster-ad-waltz-speaks.html"&gt;Mitzi Waltz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/2009/02/baron-cohen-speaks-monster-ad.html"&gt;Simon Baron-Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, and yet it's still on the air (?!).  &lt;a href="http://the-newrepublic.blogspot.com/"&gt;The New Republic&lt;/a&gt; has been following the story.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234033567164"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5908">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2fcfef30bd20af6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Ask a Stupid Question (About Ghosts) . . .</title><published>2009-02-07T18:32:12Z</published><updated>2009-02-07T18:32:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5908" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I received this hilarious email via my friend Jen. Her friend &lt;a href="http://notesandcomments1.blogspot.com/"&gt;Kevin&lt;/a&gt; is a librarian who recently had an encounter with someone in need of serious research help. Here’s what went down (I’ve deleted her name and changed the name of the TV show, to protect the credulous):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a call from a local historian who’s been asked to make an appearance on [a TV show called &amp;quot;Haunted&amp;quot;]. There is a local bowling alley that is supposed to have some, um, visitation. (The historian) has been asked to provide background as to what may have caused this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She called me. Conversation went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HER: “Do you have anything on [the name of the alley] in the vertical file?”&lt;br&gt;
[I check--we don't]&lt;br&gt;
HER: “I’m trying to think what would be a cause, as it were, of a haunting.”&lt;br&gt;
Me: “Could someone have died in a hideous bowling accent?”&lt;br&gt;
HER: “Well, no, but there was a skirmish there in 1775 and some British soldiers were killed. Do you think that’s good?”&lt;br&gt;
Me: “I think for a ghost story it’s very good.”&lt;br&gt;
HER: “But why would British soldiers be haunting a bowling alley?”&lt;br&gt;
Me: “Well. they are dead. What else would they be doing with their time?”&lt;br&gt;
HER: “But isn’t a haunting caused by some kind of horrific event?”&lt;br&gt;
Me: “Well, I imagine being killed is quite horrific.”&lt;br&gt;
HER: “Well it’s just that if I’m going to  help make a segment for a television show I want the argument to be plausible.”&lt;br&gt;
Me; “You told me the  show is called Haunted. I doubt plausibility is a major concern.”&lt;br&gt;
HER: “Oh and I remember now somebody died a really bizarre death around there at the turn of the century.”&lt;br&gt;
Me: “Bizarre death is good. Whenever you have a chance to bring up a bizarre death you absolutely must.”&lt;br&gt;
HER: “Okay, but I’ll have to do some research. I just don’t want this to seem specious.”&lt;br&gt;
Me: “I imagine the only viewers of this show are cynics like me who want to laugh at the credulous and people who actually think they’ve seen Elvis. I imagine specious will be fine. You’re starting with the premise of a haunted bowling alley. There’s no direction to go but up.”&lt;br&gt;
HER: “Oh thank you, Kevin, this is very reassuring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She actually said it without irony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not making this up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hcde.org/applications/schooldirectory/SchoolDetail.aspx?FinanceNumber=706"&gt;Dawn School &lt;/a&gt;is a k-8 school in the &lt;a href="http://www.hcde.org/site/general_info.aspx"&gt;Hamilton County School District&lt;/a&gt; (Chattanooga, Tennessee) -- it's in the small suburb of Chattanooga called &lt;a href="http://www.cityofredbank.org/"&gt;Red Bank&lt;/a&gt;.  The student population seems to&lt;a href="http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_115308.asp"&gt; include a substantial number of children&lt;/a&gt; with behavioral challenges.  Some of those students take medication, administered during the school day by the school nurse, Angela Lawson. One such student is the son of Kim Miller.  The boy&amp;#39;s behavior had been deteriorating over the last few weeks, to the point that his psychiatrist was considering hospitalization to stabilize the boy&amp;#39;s mental condition.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, January 30, Ms. Lawson was not at school.  The school principal, Lori Link, was dispensing medication in her stead.  Ms. Link noticed that Ms. Miller&amp;#39;s son&amp;#39;s medication capsule was empty.  She inspected the other capsules in the boy&amp;#39;s medication bottle, and discovered that many had been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Miller was summoned to the school.   She said, 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
&amp;quot;I felt ill when I got that phone call from the principal. I&amp;#39;ve known that nurse, I&amp;#39;ve trusted that nurse for three years. It&amp;#39;s a critical situation, it&amp;#39;s illegal, it&amp;#39;s unethical.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[snip]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"This whole thing has made me physically sick. I don't know how long it's been going on. My son wonders if someone is out to get him. He was almost hospitalized unnecessarily because of this. I can't understand why anyone would steal a child's medicine."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

You have an ill child whose health has been threatened by a school official's behavior. How does the school respond?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ms. Miller says, "To top it all off, I had to sit in the school office for more than two hours on Wednesday after I got the call. Some of the main people from Central Office met behind closed doors all that time, to do damage control I guess. Every once in a while they would walk by me and look at me, and I didn't know what was going on. They finally talked to me after about two and a half hours."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Also according to Ms. Miller, a police officer was not summoned to the school until she inquired why the no officers were on the scene.

The incident occurred on January 30, 2009. On February 6, the Hamilton County School District issued a statement:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"During the course of this investigation, the District learned that Ms. Lawson may also have tampered with student medicine. Hamilton County Department of Education immediately turned this matter over to Red Bank Police Department for further investigation."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Statements are easy to make. Reality is a bit different.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, Red Bank Police Lt. Jay LaMance says a criminal investigation has not yet begun, and his department is awaiting the results of a meeting with school officials before deciding how to proceed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ms. Lawson has been suspended without pay.

Whereas the first two may have been more like, in Darwin's own words, "a dry list of facts", this one is written in a very passionate tone. Having established that individuals vary both in domesticated breeds and in nature, he now moves into the second major ingredient of natural selection: overproduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Some important things in this chapter:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Darwin strongly emphasizes adaptation. This is not very surprising, given that he considered natural selection as the main (but not only) mechanism of evolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) We may think life is well balanced and peaceful, but there is carnage going on all around, if not right this moment then at the very least during difficult seasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;3) The struggle for life can be against the environment (e.g., surviving in cold or dry habitats), but the major factor is the biotic environment. He also points out that what matters more than survival is reproduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;success in leaving progeny&lt;/span&gt;. Two canine animals in a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which on an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. The missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and die. But several seedling missletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. As the missletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on birds; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence."&lt;/blockquote&gt;4) Darwin considers extinction to be gradual, not catastrophic (he acknowledges what we now call background extinction but not mass extinctions).&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time, though assuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another. Nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;5) Darwin recognizes different strategies of reproduction (what we now call r-selection and K-selection).&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"A large number of eggs is of some importance to those species, which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. But the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced, or the species will become extinct."&lt;/blockquote&gt;6) Competition is most intense between members of the same species because their requirements are so similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers."&lt;/blockquote&gt;7) At higher levels, closely related species experience more intense competition than distantly related species, again because their requirements are similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than between species of distinct genera.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some famous quotes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera, and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow inevitably from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.&lt;/span&gt; We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But Natural Selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; economy of nature&lt;/span&gt;; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/Y6SQO-_rGRA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234030615070"><id gr:original-id="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/?p=1379">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/765bbab133885285</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Arthritis"/><category term="Auditory Processing Disorder"/><category term="Autism/Asperger's"/><category term="Coping strategies"/><category term="Doctors"/><category term="Hypermobility"/><category term="Menopause"/><category term="Pain"/><category term="Proprioception"/><category term="TMJ"/><category term="Tinnitus"/><category term="Tourette's / tics"/><category term="epidemiology"/><category term="hyperacussis"/><category term="migraine"/><title type="html">Requesting your thoughts, please</title><published>2009-02-07T18:15:20Z</published><updated>2009-02-07T18:15:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/2009/02/07/requesting-your-thoughts-please/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://qw88nb88.wordpress.com/" type="html">Howdy folks,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABANDONED APOSTROPHES  My little item last time about the decision of the Birmingham City Council in the UK to ban the apostrophe from street and neighbourhood signs mentioned that the US experience had been taken as a precedent. A message came from Roger Payne who, as the emeritus Executive Secretary of the US Board on Geographic Names, knows whereof he speaks. The Board has discouraged the use of apostrophes since its formation in 1890 (though five exceptions have been allowed, the most recent being Clark's Mountain in Oregon in 2002), but its remit is in practice limited to natural features, so perhaps ought not to be claimed in support. In 2000, he gave the reasons for losing the possessive apostrophe in the Journal of the American Name Society: "Words when forming geographic names have lost their connotative aspects; the name is merely a label, and therefore ownership or association is no longer relevant." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who oppose losing the apostrophe may argue that the final "s" should then go, too, since you need both to mark possessives. This is happening in medical practice, which - as two examples - often refers to Down syndrome and Alzheimer disease, since they're named after the medical men who identified the conditions but who didn't suffer from them (I assume that Lou Gehrig's disease will keep its apostrophe, as it's named after a famous man who contracted it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terry Davidson noted that Australia has similar rules to those in the US and pointed me to Section 4.12 of the Guidelines for the Consistent Use of Place Names, a publication of the Committee for Geographical Names in Australia, which says in full: "In all cases of place names containing an element that has historically been written with a final -'s or -s', the apostrophe is to be deleted, e.g. Howes Valley, Rushcutters Bay, Ladys Pass. This is to facilitate the consistent matching and retrieval of placenames in database systems such as those used by the emergency services." &lt;/p&gt;

Note that Piekos talks about these bits of advice as, in part, a matter of grammar, using &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; to refer to any system of conventions regulating form. In the introduction to the manual, Piekos describes it as a mixture of &amp;quot;established tradition&amp;quot; (as he perceives it; it&amp;#39;s unlikely that he did any actual research) and personal aesthetic preferences — not unlike usage manuals for English and other languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comic book lettering has some grammatical and aesthetic traditions that are quite unique. What follows is a list [in alphabetical ordering, from Asterisk to Whispering, with illustrations, of course] that every letterer eventually commits to his/her own mental reference file. The majority of these points are established tradition, sprinkled with modern trends and a bit of my own opinion having lettered professionally for a few years now. The majority of these ideas have been established by Marvel and DC, but opinions vary from editor to editor, even within the same company. I'm often asked to bend or break these rules based on what "feels" best, or more likely, the space constraints within a panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    As a letterer you're eventually going to see scripts from writers who don't know these standards, aren't interested in them, or just have poor grammar all around. (Although I find the best writers ARE well versed in these points.) It'll be up to you to spot and fix these in the event that the editor misses them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be vigilant!&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/02/a_baffling_failure_of_peer_rev.php"&gt;weirdly awful paper&lt;/a&gt; has been retracted, but we still don't know how it got published in the first place. &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/rncse/28/3/creationism-slips-into-peer-reviewed-journal"&gt;NCSE Reports has an excellent summary of the affair&lt;/a&gt;, but the conclusion is still highly unsatisfactory (the conclusion of the event, that is, not the summary, which is spot on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE EDITOR'S RESPONSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I contacted the editor-in-chief of Proteomics, Michael Dunn, to find out more about what happened. Many scientists have speculated publicly that the peer review process went seriously wrong for this paper. Dunn assured me that the paper was reviewed by two "well-respected and highly competent reviewers" both of whom recommended minor revisions. For some reason, though, "neither picked up the references to creationism, nor did they recognize that sections of the text were plagiarized," according to Dunn. It is not too surprising that the reviewers missed the plagiarism, but the title and abstract should have raised huge red flags warning the reviewers that this article had questionable science. I have to conclude that the reviewers were very sloppy, incompetent, or both; at the very least they were inattentive in this case, despite the editor's claims to the contrary. And Dunn himself is not without responsibility in this case: he must have seen the reference to "the soul" in the article's title, and he should have been more pro-active. His failure to make any public statement about the creationist claims in the article also raises questions about the leadership at the journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This entire episode points out a weakness in scientific peer review that creationists and other pseudoscience proponents may try to exploit again. We only caught this attempted fraud thanks to the diligence of bloggers: the journal itself had already missed it. What is perhaps more troubling is the fact that the journal relied solely on the plagiarism to force the retraction: if not for that, the article might have been published despite its unsubstantiated creationist claims. I asked Dunn specifically about this issue, but he declined to comment. The Warda and Han paper demonstrates a new strategy that proponents of creationism might attempt again, and perhaps next time they will not be so foolish as to plagiarize their text. We can only hope that the publicity surrounding this incident will alert both reviewers and editors of scientific journals to be on the lookout for "stealth" creationist claims in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of the paper was &lt;i&gt;"Mitochondria, the missing link between body and soul: Proteomic prospective evidence."&lt;/i&gt; I'm still baffled by the fact that "well-respected and highly competent reviewers" could completely overlook the title and an abstract that makes extravagant claims for a complete and rather revolutionary revision of the most widely accepted explanation for the origins of mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/whatever_happened_with_the_pro.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/z7QsZFOlbvg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234021834068"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5684246896652456427">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f488eeb4ca0f9ab</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The First Chapter of My New Book: The Darwinian Problem of Evil</title><published>2009-02-08T04:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-07T15:15:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/534165872/first-chapter-of-my-new-book-darwinian.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5684246896652456427/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5684246896652456427" title="2 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/first-chapter-of-my-new-book-darwinian.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">See what you think.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Darwinian Problem of Evil: Christianity and the Problem of Animal Suffering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter one (draft without formatting).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is about sentient non-human animals, all of them, both domesticated and those in the wild. Typically the animal kingdom in its most loosely stated definition includes every living thing in distinction from plant kingdom. Plants are in a different category, even though there is no single criterion to distinguish between them. [Wennberg, p. 25 lists them]. Although it’s been estimated that nearly 98% of all species that have ever existed on earth are extinct, there are over one million different species of animals in existence today, from humans, to chimpanzees, monkeys, bears, elephants, lions, tigers, antelope, deer, dolphins, sharks, whales, jellyfish, eagles, finches, bats, mice, lizards, snakes, flies, bees, beetles, spiders, earthworms, lice, and even one celled animals called “protozoa.” We make distinctions between them. There are vertebrates with a backbone, while others are invertebrates who lack one. There are mammals while others are not, and so forth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is about their sufferings in this natural world, all of them. In this world of ours they suffer, sometimes quite a bit, through the natural law of the jungle where “nature is red in tooth and claw,” and also at the hands of human beings. Upon the supposition of Darwinian evolutionary biology this suffering of theirs is natural. It’s what we would expect to find. But upon the supposition of Christian theism I’ll argue this is not what we should expect to find. I will argue that the empirical fact of animal suffering is one of the most difficult problems when it comes to the belief in Christian theism. I will argue that the existence of animal suffering cannot be plausibly reconciled with the Christian faith and as such is one of the strongest reasons to reject it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are journal articles and chapters written by skeptics in other books dealing with this difficulty. But to my knowledge this will be the first full length book examining this specific problem from a skeptical perspective. I will examine and find wanting all of the major Christian defenses available that are used to answer this serious difficulty. This book is a direct response to a few recent Christian attempts to deal with this problem, most notably, Michael J. Murray's book, Nature Red in Tooth and Claw; Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering, Gregory Boyd’s book, Satan and the Problem of Evil: Constructing a Trinitarian Warfare Theodicy, Peter van Inwagen's book, The Problem of Evil, and Robert N. Wennberg's book, God, Humans, and Animals, among some of the most notable attempts. I will claim they all fail to provide satisfactory answers to the problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I consider this book to be an extension of my previous work titled Why I Became an Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity, which contains the basic structure and background for the arguments in this one. I’ll try not to refer to it too often, but it is essential reading for considering the arguments in this book. In my chapters on the problem of evil in this previous book I argued that animal suffering is a serious problem for Christianity, part of an “empirical refutation of Christianity” if there could be one. In this present book I will flesh out that specific argument in greater detail by considering the various Christian responses that have been offered in answer to this problem, and by attempting to show none of them singularly or taken as a whole provide a satisfactory answer to it. As with my previous book I am targeting the college student, not the professional philosopher. My goal is to understand the arguments of the professional philosopher and without sacrificing precision or depth, to speak these same arguments to a different, but educated, audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My claim is that Christian theism fails because of this problem. It fails because of the Biblical statements found in their so-called inspired book. It fails because of the ill treatment animals have suffered because of Christianity throughout the ages. And it fails to have a reasonably satisfactory philosophical and theological answer to this problem. I'll argue that all Christian explanations for the existence of animal suffering are impotent. The Darwinian evolutionary answer is a better answer for why animals suffer, which excludes the Christian notion of God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem of evil is at least as old as the book of Job in the Bible. It takes many different forms. In this story, Job suffered the loss of his children, his servant/slaves, and his animals at the hands of an overzealous prosecuting attorney known as “the adversary” (this is not used as a proper name for Satan), who is granted permission by God to do harm to Job and his property to test his piety and integrity. At his direction the Sabeans, we’re told, stole Job’s oxen and asses and the slaves who attended them. Fire from heaven destroyed Job’s sheep and the slaves who attended them. The Chaldeans stole his camels and destroyed the slaves who attended them. Then a “great wind” blew down the house his sons and daughters were in and killed them all. Later Job was afflicted with the same kind of painful boils the Egyptians suffered as one of ten plagues in the Exodus story (Exodus 9:8-12).   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this folktale we see the utter lack of divine compassion on Job’s family and on his animals. They are all mere pawns that were abused for the sake of Job’s test. The story shows no care or concern for these other players, or on Job’s wife, who also suffered the insufferable, the loss of her children. They must all suffer so that Job can be tested. Their health and welfare are of no concern to God in the story itself. For what reason did they die? They only served as instrumental goods, not intrinsic goods. They were expendable. They had no value in and of themselves. Only Job and his faith were important to God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What must be acknowledged is that the person directly responsible for sending all of this suffering on Job and his family is not “the adversary,” anyway. This Satan is merely the ancient equivalent of the thought police. He is not depicted as evil in the story, but rather, as a member of the heavenly court he was just doing his job. He brings an accusation against Job. He claims the reason Job fears and worships God is merely because life is good for him. Anyone can fear God under these conditions, Satan accuses him. But if God will make him suffer then he won’t. In the story Satan doesn’t have any authority to afflict Job with suffering himself. Only God can do that, and do that he did. After Job lost all of his children and "property" we read where God admitted this to Satan: “you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.” (Job 2:3, New International Version). That’s what it says. God was moved to inflict suffering upon Job “without any reason” (or “without a cause,” Revised Standard Version). Then we read at the end of the book, when Job’s brothers and sisters came to him, that after his trials “they showed him sympathy and comforted him for &lt;strong&gt;all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him&lt;/strong&gt; (Job 42:11). That’s what the text says. It was God who brought all this evil upon Job. God admitted this. The people in the story admitted this. The lesson is that Job must trust in God even when God does horrendous things to him. Left unresolved is exactly why Job should trust in such a God who afflicts him with such intense suffering. This test seems analogous to a husband who beats his wife and asks her to trust that he loves her. What kind of request is this when her husband is beating her? The beatings are evidence he cannot be trusted and that he does not love her. Should she go with the evidence or with what he says?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This last question reminds me of Basil Mitchell’s Parable of the Stranger, which was meant as a counter-parable to Antony Flew’s Parable of the Invisible Gardner. The question for Mitchell’s parable was whether “pain counts against the assertion that God loves men,” and by extension whether the belief in God could be falsified and thereby made to be meaningful. Mitchell tells about a member of the resistance movement during WWII who meets up with a Stranger who claims to be the leader of their movement. The partisan member becomes convinced that the Stranger is indeed the leader of their movement by meeting and talking with him. Before the Stranger departs from him never to be with him again, Mitchell says the Stranger tells the partisan to “have faith in him no matter what happens.” After this meeting the Stranger's behavior is seen to be highly ambiguous, helping the resistance on some occasions and on other occasions not helping at all. But the partisan continues to believe. “The Stranger knows best,” he is found to be saying to his detractors. But they are undetermined. They respond, “Well, if that’s what you mean by his being on our side, the sooner he goes over to the other side the better.” Mitchell makes a point from all of this that there is a difference between evidence that “counts against” the partisan’s belief in the Stranger, and evidence that counts “decisively against” this belief. And he relates this parable to the statement “God loves men.” Once a believer is convinced “God loves men,” then although there is evidence that may count against such a belief, it doesn’t entail that this evidence counts decisively against it. [This exchange is reprinted in various anthologies such at the one edited by Malcolm L. Diamond and Thomas V. Litzenburg, Jr., The Logic of God: Theology and Verification (Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1975), pp. 263-65]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Antony Flew concedes Mitchell’s distinction between evidence that “counts against” and evidence that “counts decisively” against the belief in God. That being agreed upon Flew goes on to argue that what constitutes a good explanation for God’s goodness in light of the available evidence of suffering in this world is in danger of “that death by a thousand qualifications.” Mitchell’s difficulty, he argues, “is that he has given God attributes which rule out all possible saving explanations. In Mitchell’s parable of the Stranger it is easy for the believer to find plausible excuses for ambiguous behavior: for the Stranger is a man. But suppose the Stranger is God. We cannot say that he would like to help but cannot: God is omnipotent. We cannot say that he would like to help if he only knew: God is omniscient. We cannot say that he is not responsible for the wickedness of others: God creates those others. Indeed an omnipotent, omniscient God must be an accessory before (and during) the fact to every human misdeed; as well as being responsible for every non-moral defect in the universe.” [Ibid., p. 266] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I agree, especially when it comes to “every non-moral defect in the universe.” I see no satisfactory way around this problem, especially when the believer is committed to the written text we found in the Book of Job itself, where we find God himself claiming responsibility for sending the sufferings upon Job, his family, and his animals. My specific claim in this book is that the available evidence of suffering in the animal kingdom counts decisively against the belief in a good, omnipotent, omniscient God, even though I know I may not be able to convince many Christian theists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Job we already see several elements of the problem of evil as traditionally conceived, and several attempts at answering it. There is “the adversary” (or “a Satan”) who tests us. There are human beings who inflict suffering upon Job and his family (Sabeans and Chaldeans). Then there are natural disasters (fire and wind), and diseases (boils) that produce suffering. The question in the remaining chapters in the book of Job concerns why righteous people like Job are made to suffer. Job maintained his innocence and makes a passionate plea to make his case before God himself, while his friends all claimed he must have sinned. God finally appears in a whirlwind at the end of the book and tells them all that he does not have to explain his ways to them as mere mortals—that his ways are basically inscrutable. Job repents of asking for an audience with God, and then God gives Job more children and flocks of oxen, sheep, asses and camels as a reward for passing the test (Job 1:22; 2:3; 2:10).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When facing the problem of evil it is usually broken down into two manageable, distinct problems, although they are really part and parcel of the same problem concerning why there is so much intensive suffering in our world if there is a perfectly good, omnipotent, omniscient God. First and foremost there is the problem of moral evil. This is the evil that free willed creatures do to cause suffering to one another. Job’s folktale is about this problem. Whether it’s the evil choices of angelic moral beings or human beings, the fact that God has created moral creatures at all is used to deflect the problem of the sufferings caused by free agents to one another. When it comes to a human being who brutally rapes a small girl and cuts her into pieces afterward, God is said to have allowed this state of affairs because of the greater good that comes from the value of having morally free creatures in the first place, for instance. Of course, I find that just as repulsive as a mother watching one son beating a younger son to death without intervening. I find that just as repulsive as letting all convicted criminals out of prison because of the value of having free moral creatures in a society. When it comes to evil angelic beings who supposedly wreak havoc on our world, I find that just as repulsive as a father letting a pack of ravenous wolves into his home filled with children just so he can rescue some of them. A few of them will die and others will be mauled, but what matters is that the father rescued some of them and is supposed to receive praise for doing so. Not on your life! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, there is the problem of natural evil. This is the suffering that is experienced as the result of natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, famines, wild fires, earthquakes, tsunami’s, diseases, poisonous creatures, parasites, and the law of predation, where it is kill or be killed in the jungle to survive. The problem of natural evil is more difficult to solve and has caused a number God’s defenders to throw up their hands by claiming we just don’t know why it exists, that’s God’s ways are completely “inscrutable.” The typical Christian answers given in answering it will be addressed later in this book, along with some newer more sophisticated ones. Most notable among the typical answers is that all natural evil is due either to Satan or the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden, or that the evils in the natural world are necessary for man’s moral and intellectual development such that they are outweighed by these lessons. There are others. Job’s folktale is about this problem as well, although it doesn’t concern itself with the problem of animal suffering I address in this book. &lt;strong&gt;I consider the problem of animal suffering to be the most important subsidiary of the problem of natural evil and the most intractable problem for Christians to reconcile with the belief in their God.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Nature Red in Tooth and Claw”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The title for this book and this chapter comes from a suggestion by Michael J. Murray, who is a Christian Professor in Humanities at Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, PA, in his book, Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering (p. 1). In 1859 when Charles Darwin published his work, The Origin of the Species, the world learned how all life is interconnected with each other through an evolutionary process stretching back billions of years in time. By Darwin’s detailed scientific investigations we learned that humans are directly related to other animals by virtue of our biology. We are not special to earth’s ecosystem. We depend on each other. We are related to other animals. It could no longer be said, except in the backwoods and Bible thumping pulpits in the world, that we were created instantaneously by divine fiat during a twenty-four hour long sixth day of a seven literal day week, as Genesis chapter one tells us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This caused Christians to undertake a great and significant change in their theology. Although the reaction from the Bible thumping crowd was intense, it forced more thoughtful believers to re-examine their Bibles to see if the literal week of creation was demanded of the Genesis text, and they concluded it was not. The Catholic Church was the first to embrace Darwin’s views, having previously learned some crucial lessons from the Galileo public relations debacle about the relationship of science and religion. Today most Christians seem to accept the fact that human beings have evolved, although they will claim such an evolutionary process was directed by their God in some important ways. As such they will prefer to call this evolutionary process by the theological term “creation,” or “progressive creation,” or “intelligent design.” In any case, Darwin won the day, for the overwhelming number of scientifically literate educated people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In rehearsing his own process from Christian to agnostic Charles Darwin first laid out what I accept as the Darwinian Problem of Evil. The implications of his own evolutionary conclusions caused him to cease believing. In his Autobiography he wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That there is much suffering in the world no one disputes. Some have attempted to explain this in reference to man by imagining that it serves for his moral improvement. But the number of men in the world is nothing compared with that of all other sentient beings, and these often suffer greatly without any moral improvement. A being so powerful and so full of knowledge as a God who could create this universe, is to our finite minds omnipotent and omniscient, and it revolts our understanding to suppose that his benevolence is not unbounded, for what advantage can there be in the suffering of millions of the lower animals throughout almost endless time? This very argument from the existence of suffering against the existence of an intelligent cause,” he tells us in an understatement, “seems to be a strong one.” [The Autobiography of Charles Darwin, 1809-1882 (New York; W.W. Norton and Company, 1958, pp. 85-96].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael J. Murray sums up the thoughts of many Christians who accepted Darwin at the end of the nineteenth century after trying to grapple with this problem, by quoting from John Fiske, a student of Herbert Spencer. Fiske wrote: “A scheme which permits thousands of generations to live and die in wretchedness cannot…be absolved from the…charge of awkwardness or malevolence….it is impossible to call that Being good, who, existing prior to the phenomenal universe, and creating it out of the plenitude of infinite power and foreknowledge, endowed it with such properties that its material and moral development must inevitably be attended by the misery of untold millions of sentient creatures for whose existence their creator is ultimately alone responsible.” [John Fiske, Micellaneous Writings, 4, Outline of Cosmic Philosophy (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1902, p. 225) cited by Murray in Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering (p. 4)].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This same argument is being used in today’s world by so-called New Atheist journalist Christopher Hitchens, who states it with characteristic rhetorical certainty. Based upon the claim that “at least 98 % of all species on this tiny speck of a planet made only a few hesitant steps ‘forward’ before succumbing to extinction,” Hitchens rhetorically asks: “What kind of designer or creator is so wasteful and capricious and approximate? What kind of designer or creator is so cruel and indifferent?” [The Portable Atheist, pp. xviii]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Hitchens isn’t done yet, for it must be remembered that human beings evolved from the lower animals. Continuing on, Hitchens asks us most of all, “what kind of designer or creator only chooses to ‘reveal’ himself to semi-stupefied peasants in desert regions?” He elaborates in these words: “[H]ere is something that is impossible for anyone to believe. The human species has been in existence as Homo sapiens for (let us not quarrel about the exact total) at least one hundred and fifty thousand years. An instant in evolutionary time, this is nonetheless a vast history when contemplated by primates with brains and imaginations of the dimensions that we can boast. In order to subscribe to monotheistic religion, one must believe that humans were born, struggled, and expired during this time, often dying in childbirth or for want of elementary nurture, and with a life-expectancy of perhaps three decades at most. Add to these factors the turf wars between discrepant groups and tribes, alarming outbreaks of disease, which had no germ theory to explain let alone palliate them, and associated natural disasters and human tragedies. And yet, for all these millennia, heaven watched with indifference and then—and only in the last six thousand years at the very least—decided that it was time to intervene as well as redeem. And heaven would only intervene and redeem in remote areas of the Middle East, thus ensuring that many more generations would expire before the news could begin to spread!...The willingness even to entertain such elaborately mad ideas involves much more than the suspension of disbelief, or the dumb credulity that greets magic tricks.” [The Portable Atheist, pp. xix-xx] &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hitchens’s point is that since Homo sapiens existed for about one hundred and fifty thousand years before the theistic God supposedly revealed himself to them, then just like their animal predecessors, these human beings suffered an immense amount both as predators and as prey in the animal world before God revealed anything to them and/or redeemed them from their learned predatory behavior. If we assume the Bible is from God, the earliest parts of it weren’t written until at best thirty four hundred years ago, if that. So now we not only have the problem of non-human animal suffering up until to the first Homo sapiens. We also have the problem of human animal suffering up until God decides to reveal himself to them and/or to do something about it. It’s all part and parcel of the whole Darwinian Problem of Evil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why would a designer or creator God create the universe in this way? It strongly indicates an utter divine disregard for the millions of animals, human or otherwise, who evolved for billions of years, and in the case of human beings, over hundreds of thousands of years, before he revealed anything to them or did anything to help them in their sufferings during the long march toward the arrival of human beings, the apex of his creation, with whom he could talk to and redeem from their past evolutionary predatory environment. No wonder Darwin retorted: “What a book a devil’s chaplain might write on the clumsy wasteful, blundering, low, and horribly cruel works of nature!” [The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, 2nd ed. F. Darwin (New York: Appleton, 1901(, p. 105.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Dawkins chimes in by telling us that the Darwinian Problem of Evil does not just refer to the evolutionary past. The problem still faces us every single day, he writes: “It is better for the genes of Darwin’s ichneumon wasp that the caterpillar should be alive, and therefore fresh, when it is eaten, no matter what the cost in suffering. Genes don’t care about suffering because they don’t care about anything. If Nature were kind, she would at least make the minor concession of anesthetizing caterpillars before they are eaten alive from within. But Nature is neither kind nor unkind. She is neither against suffering nor for it….The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive; others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear; others are being slowly devoured from within by rasping parasites; thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst and disease.” When this is contrasted to the conviction of the theistic God and the theological answer that we just “don’t know” why God allows all of this suffering, Dawkins responds in this manner: “The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.” [River out of Eden: A Darwinian View Of Life (New York: HarperCollins, 1996), p. 131-32].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is even more to this problem. As animals we human beings are considered at the top of the food chain because we’ve developed the technology to dominate and destroy all of the lower animals if we want to do so. Most all living creatures are eaten as food by at least some of us on the planet. The history of the clash between human animals and the lower animals has been devastating to the lower animals. We have hunted some of them down until they were almost extinct, like the Buffalo. Others have gone extinct because of us. We have killed them just for the sake of killing them for their trophy heads. We have trapped them for just their furs. We’ve slaughtered elephants just for their ivory tusks. We’ve experimented on them in grotesque ways, sometimes even dissecting them while they were still alive. We’ve abused them for our own entertainment through cock fights, bull fights and dog fights. We have crammed them into small sized pens for what’s called “intensive farming techniques” to save space where they stay all of their lives to wait to be slaughtered for our own consumption later on. Some fish we like to eat so fresh that we cook them and eat them while they are still alive and gasping for oxygen (Sushi).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a new awareness in the last few decades that we shouldn’t unnecessarily harm animals, even to the point where vegetarianism/veganism is becoming an alternative lifestyle to more and more people because of this. Because of science it’s hard if not extremely difficult or impossible to suggest, as was thought in a previous century, that animals don’t feel any pain. And with the Darwinian Problem of Evil people are coming to grips with the obligation to help alleviate animals from their sufferings at the hands of human beings as much as we can. We now outlaw some abuses toward animals. Trapping animals is now considered animal cruelty as are some kinds of animal experimentation. Dog and cock fights are illegal. Other activities are frowned on, like wearing fur, since we don’t need it to cover ourselves, and intensive farming (something that was made illegal in a referendum in California, the pacesetter state, in a 2008 election). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this new humane awareness toward animals Christian people must now come to grips with what their God purportedly said in the Bible about the relationship of man to beast. If there is a Christian God and if he revealed himself in the pages of the Bible, then the Christian must try to show, based upon what we’ve come to learn about animals, their sufferings, and the interconnectedness of all living creatures by virtue of evolutionary biology in this ecosystem, that their God did not sanction animal cruelty based on ancient ideas about them. They must try to show that their God can still be a perfectly good God given what we know when it comes to the moral and legal status of animals in relationship to human beings. I will argue in that the Bible, if it came from the Christian God, does not reflect much of a concern with the lives of most of the things he supposedly created on earth. I will argue that if God is perfectly good he should have been crystal clear in his revelation about how to treat animals if he was perfectly good and cared for them. He should’ve been crystal clear that his followers should treat the rest of his creation kindly and not harshly, living in as much peace as is possible. This is not what we find and it wasn’t what the major interpretive theological and exegetical voices in the church found for millennia about them, until recently. But this is par for the course, in my opinion. The church gains a new understanding about some similar issue, like racism, slavery, feminism, homosexuality, war, or capital punishment, and then it looks for any minority voices it can find in the Bible to say it was there all along. The church is forced to do eisegesis not exegesis when faced with a great moral reversal like these kinds of things, and it’s doing the same thing again with regard to the ethical treatment of animals.       &lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;This is the problem for the theist with regard to the problem of animal suffering. Does the evidence of the amount of suffering in this world lead us to think the theist is correct, or the atheist? Which explanation for what we find in the natural world is the better one, capable of explaining what we see in the animal kingdom. I will argue against the Christian theist explanation in this book. I think the best explanation is that there is no teleology to life apart from DNA and natural selection of biological organisms. The divine hypothesis requires far too many ad hoc hypotheses, contorted reasoning, and mental gymnastics for scientifically literate people to accept in today’s world. The ancient superstitious religion in its modern forms cannot satisfactorily explain why, if the kind of God in the Christian tradition exists, this world has been and is what it is today. The simpler and best way to explain what we see in the world of nature is by blind evolutionary natural selective processes, apart from any divine agency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philosophical Arguments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem of such intense and ubiquitous animal suffering calls for a Christian answer. The kind of answer considered satisfactory will depend on several factors relating to the problem itself. There is a long-standing distinction between a logical (or deductive) problem and an evidential (or inductive) problem. The logical problem is used to try to show there is a logical incompatibility between the attributes of God and the existence of suffering in our world. If the argument succeeds then it would be judged impossible that such a God existed. That’s emphatically not what I will be arguing for in this book. Instead, my argument will be an evidential (or inductive) one. It is a probabilistic problem leading to the conclusion that such a God is improbable given the empirical facts of the existence, duration, and intensity of the horrendous nature of animal suffering. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two leading philosophical arguments against the existence of God with regard to animal suffering are made by two Professors of Philosophy at Purdue University, Indiana, William L. Rowe, and Paul Draper. Both of them are evidential arguments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowe argues that: (1) There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse. (2) An omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse. Therefore: (3) there does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being. According to Rowe, we cannot know with certainty that instances of (1) take place. But it is one thing to prove that (1) is true and quite another thing to have rational grounds for believing (1) to be true. In light of our past experience and knowledge, it is very probable that such events have occurred, thus making (1) reasonable to believe. (1) Taken together with (2), can rationally lead us to the conclusion (3). [William Rowe, “The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism,” American Philosophical Quarterly 16, no. 4 (October 1979)].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowe offers two specific instances of evil that support his argument, one involving moral evil, and the other involving natural evil. The natural evil case he described was of a fawn that was badly burned and slowly died from a forest fire, without any human observer. Rowe argued that an omnipotent, omniscient being could’ve “prevented the fawn’s apparently pointless suffering.” A wholly good omnipotent being could have stopped the lightning, diverted it, kept the tree from starting a fire, or kept the fawn from being burned, or if burned, could have spared it the intense suffering for days by quickly ending its life. But since God didn’t, such a God doesn’t exist, for he would not allow this fawn to suffer if it doesn’t serve some outweighing attainable good, and not even a theist can come up with a good reason why such a fawn suffered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowe’s case concerns the existence of gratuitous evil. Gratuitous evils are things that serve no higher purpose and are not necessary for any equal or outweighing good. They are superfluous to God’s plans and as such need not occur for God’s plans to succeed. Rowe’s argument is that if we grant the existence of a good, all-powerful and all-knowing God, then the existence of one such gratuitous evil makes it improbable that such a God exists. He argues that it is improbable that at least one such gratuitous evil exists. Therefore he argues it’s improbable that such a God exists. This is a localized argument, a direct argument, against the existence of such a God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Draper has argued for different type of evidential argument from the suffering of animals, not based on one instance of gratuitous evil, but based upon the vast amount of stomach turning evil that is represented by the law of the jungle, the law of predation, which is the Darwinian Problem of Evil in its philosophical form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Draper “the theory of evolution of species by means of natural selection explains numerous facts much better than the alternative hypothesis, that each species of plant and animal was independently created by God.” Specifically Draper argues, “Both pain and pleasure contributes to two central biological goals of individual organisms, namely, survival and reproduction.” [Paul Draper, “Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists,” in The Evidential Argument from Evil, ed., Daniel Howard-Snyder (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996), pp. 12-29]. But since God doesn’t need the biological usefulness of pain and pleasure in attaining these twin goals, and since God additionally needs good moral reasons for allowing for pain, theism is antecedently more implausible than, say, atheism. This is particularly persuasive when we consider how long sentient animals had to suffer through this evolutionary process before the arrival of humans. His is a global argument, for this kind of suffering takes place globally every second of every day. The amount of this suffering cannot be calculated. By contrast, Rowe’s argument is a local one which highlights a specific particular evil. Taken together these two arguments are generating a great deal of discussion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take Rowe’s argument, for instance, based on the existence of one gratuitous evil in the natural world. Some Christian philosophers like Terence Penelhum and Michael J. Murray have agreed, in Murray’s words, that “gratuitous evils are not morally permissible by God.” [Nature, Red in Tooth and Claw. p. 14, footnote # 5; See also Terence Penelhum, “Divine Goodness and the Problem of Evil,” in Readings in the Philosophy of Religion, ed. Baruch Brody (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1974), pp. 214–26]. Other Christian philosophers like William Hasker and Peter van Inwagen have argued that the existence of gratuitous evils is consistent with the omni-God of Christian theism. [William Hasker, The Triumph of God over Evil: Theodicy for a World of Suffering (Downers Grove: IVP Academic, 2008), chapter 7, and Peter van Inwagen, The Problem of Evil, Lecture 5]. We’ll look at both attempts to solve Rowe’s problem in a later chapter in this book. And we’ll also look at some major responses to Draper’s argument as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been two standards Christian have appealed to in order to deflect the problem of evil. The first standard is called a Theodicy, the second one is called a Defense. Christian philosopher Alvin C. Plantinga distinguished between them when dealing with the problem of moral evil. A theodicy “attempts to tell us why God permits evil,” he says. This is a strong answer, if satisfactory, for when the theodicist is done making her case there would be little left to explain away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leibniz, who coined the word “theodicy,” attempted to do this by claiming that this was the best of all possible worlds based on an a priori deduction that it must be so, because he already believed in a perfectly good omnipotent God. Such a strong tactic is usually considered by Christians to be a failure to be avoided. Peter Van Inwagen argues, for instance, that “apologists need not believe that they know, or that any human being knows, the real truth about God and evil. The apologist is, after all, in a position analogous to that of a counsel for the defense who is trying to create ‘reasonable doubt’ as regards the defendant’s guilt in the minds of jurors.” [The Problem of Evil, p. 7]. We’ll come back to his standard shortly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since a theodicy is asking far too much of a Christian, Plantinga lowered the standard of what’s to be considered a satisfactory answer to the problem of evil by introducing the concept of a defense. In a defense “the aim is not to say what God’s reason is, but at most what God’s reason might possibly be.” [Emphasis his. God, Freedom, and Evil, (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1974), p. 28].  I’m looking for an adequate or reasonably based theodicy, not a defense, when it comes to answering the problem of evil, one that offers up a more or less rational explanation for why there is so much intense suffering if a good omnipotent God exists. It need not explain everything, but it should explain a great deal. A defense merely suggests that something is possible. What kind of standard is that? Take a look at this with me. Most anything is possible if we grant there is an omniscient God, which I don’t. His omniscience can be used to over-ride any knowledge we might have. Is it possible that God knows the reason for why there is so much suffering in our world if his knowledge supersedes ours in such infinite ways? That’s a question we’ll be returning to, of course, but if all a Christian theist must do is to suggest a possible reason for the suffering then that standard is way too low and would be inadmissible in any reasonable discussion about anything else. Let’s say we want to know who made the Egyptian pyramids and someone suggested that they were made by aliens. How probable is that? Where is the evidence for this? One need not have evidence when it comes to what might possibly be the case. In my opinion Christians retreat to that kind of standard far too often to defend what they believe, for we don’t want to know what might possibly be the case, but what is probably the case. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Granted, Plantinga was speaking of a defense when it came to the logical argument of evil, but a defense is now usually considered adequate when it comes to the evidential argument of evil, and that’s simply not acceptable, as atheist philosopher Keith Parsons writes: “…for every evil that exists, a sufficiently clever theist might be able to imagine a scenario, no matter how farfetched, wildly implausible, or outrageously ad hoc, that if it were true, would justify God’s permission of that evil.” Continuing on later, Parsons argues that a Christian argument “must do more than show that the world’s evils are possibly justified; it must give plausible grounds for thinking that in fact they are justified.” Then with some flare Parsons concludes: “Without an adequate theodicy, arguing for God’s existence will be like arguing that the earth is flat. Vast quantities of contrary data will either have to be ignored of dealt with in an arbitrary and ad hoc fashion.” [Emphasis his. God and the Burden of Proof: Plantinga, Swinburne, and the Analytic Defense of Theism (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1989, pp. 125, 132].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael J. Murray recognizes this problem when trying to steer a middle ground between a theodicy and a defense. He rejects the standard of a theodicy, of course, because that standard is too high, which is par for the course. But he also rejects the low standard of a defense. He wrote: “Defenses will be of little use in our context because…they do not aim to provide explanations that undercut the evidential value of evil.” [Emphasis his. Nature Red in Tooth and Claw, p. 37]. Instead he aims “to find a middle way between defense and theodicy.” His accepted standard is named by him to be De Causa Dei, a phrase that also comes from Leibniz, meaning “on behalf of God,” reminiscent of a juridical context about the case on behalf of a defendant in a trial. Such a standard might best be described by him: [T]he theist may freely admit that she is not aware of any plausible hypotheses which turn back the evidential challenge. Still, there might be a variety of reasons which are, for example, true for all she knows and which are such that if they were true they would constitute good explanations for evil. Reasons like these would not fairly count as plausible (not implausible) but rather as plausible as not, overall.” [Emphasis his. Nature Red in Tooth and Claw, p. 38]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is Murray’s standard itself too low? It’s on the right track, I’ll admit. But what does he mean by the phrases, “true for all she knows,” and “plausible as not, overall”? Two pages earlier he mentioned how that the death of Jesus was both evil and good. It was evil because Jesus suffered, but it was good because it brought about the “great good of salvation for humanity.” What Murray ends up proposing is that given everything a Christian believer accepts about the triune God who became incarnate, who atoned for the sins of humanity, who ascended into heaven and will bring believers into God’s presence in the future, he can offer some “plausible” answers with regard to the problem of animal suffering. Can he do this? I think not, not by a long shot. But even if he can, it still doesn’t show that what the Christian believer accepts that forms the basis for all she knows, is true. There are so many other defeaters to this collection of Christian beliefs, beliefs which cannot be reasonably defended, that Murray shouldn’t even be dealing with reconciling these Christian background beliefs with the problem of evil. For these background beliefs cannot be defended either. Not by a long shot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter Van Inwagen thinks he can convince us “that the argument from evil has not got the power to transform ideal (and hence neutral) agnostics into atheists,” and therefore it’s a “philosophical failure.” Neutral agnostics, by his lights, are people who don’t have an opinion either way on the matter, unlike so-called weighted agnostics, who think it’s improbable that God exists. He calls this “the ideal debate test,” which, if he’s successful “will also show that the argument from evil is incapable of turning neutral agnostics into weighted agnostics” as well. He acknowledges that the whole concept of an ideal test is problematic, but we’ll leave that aside. Still I don’t think he accomplishes what he proposes, as we’ll see when it comes to suffering in the animal kingdom. Let me just say that the argument from evil, if successful, does not lead one to atheism or “weighted” agnosticism anyway. It could lead one to mysticism, pantheism, or process theology. The argument from evil, if successful, merely shows that if God exists he does not have one or more of the three attributes normally ascribed to him by Christian theism, namely he might not be perfectly good, or all powerful, or omniscient. That’s all it can show. So what Van Inwagen should say instead, is that the argument from evil will not be able to persuade neutral agnostics that this kind of God doesn’t exist. I think it would, most definitely, and I hope to show this to be the case.      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Christian Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The insufferable empirical facts of intense and horrific suffering must be reconciled with the whole notion of the Christian concept of God, if such a concept of God is reasonable to believe. If there is a perfectly good God who loves every one of his creatures then why have so many of his creatures suffered such excruciating pain? If God is all powerful then why couldn’t his creatures live in a different world or have different characteristics such that they didn’t experience such unbearable suffering? If God is all knowing then why is it he didn’t know how to accomplish his goals in a different manner so that his creatures wouldn’t have such an agonizing existence? If God is a revealing God then why did he wait to reveal himself to Homo sapiens until around the year 1350 BCE, after hundreds of thousands of years of disease, wars, famines, fires, hurricanes, droughts and death, if he did at all? If God is a redeeming God then why did he wait for so long to act in history on behalf of his creatures before doing so, if he did so at all? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read a helpful description of the attributes of the theistic God in the context of the problem of evil, see Christian philosopher Peter Van Inwagen’s book The Problem of Evil [“Lecture 2: The Idea of God,” by pp. 18-36]. He defines God as a necessarily unique being, a person, who created all things ex nihilo “out of nothing,” and is omnipotent, omniscient, morally perfect, eternal, immutable, and omnipresent. I would merely like to point out that the 11th century Anselmian conception of God Van Inwagen defends is not what we find in the Bible itself, as I’ve summarized in Why I Became an Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity, and which I argued for throughout that book. [(Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2008), pp. 98-100]. It is simply not true that the Bible consistently depicts God as being omnipresent, morally perfect, omniscient, and immutable, as Professor Van Inwagen defines him. Nor did this God create the universe ex nihilo “out of nothing,” either. This is a concept of God that has been made up by theologians based upon the best that they can conceive, precisely because they were westerners living in a gospel enriched society who already had the basic framework for thinking about such a God. Eastern pantheistic thinkers have of a much different God described as the ONE, which cannot even be conceived. Both of these views of God are philosophical constructs that not to be found in any so-called historical revelations from God himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it is true that how the Christian theist defines her God will make a big difference when it comes to the attempted solutions to the problem of evil that confronts them. Van Inwagen’s description of his God, following St. Anselm, is standard fare among many Christian theists today, especially evangelicals. This conception of God is the one that has the most difficulty with the problem of intense suffering, since God is defined as person who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenelovent. Process theologians by contrast, have given up defining God as omnipotent, in light of the very problem of evil we’re discussing, and in light of the problem of defining just what it means to say God is omnipotent, which Van Inwagen elaborates on. For process theologians the problem of animal suffering demands a different response than Inwagen offers, and it demands a different rebuttal on my behalf. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many Calvinists who accept St. Anselm’s conception of God, but they severely limit God’s goodness. They do not claim God is omnibenelovent, or perfectly good, to all of God’s creatures, just a few of them chosen by God. They accept the many Biblical statements that tell us God sends “evil” upon people, as we just saw in Job (see also Isaiah 45:7). According to these Calvinists, God is only good to part of his creation, the elect human beings whom he chose to be his before the creation of the world. For them God is a sovereign potentate who gives and takes away life as he wills, who only loves those people he has chosen to be his elect sons through Jesus’ limited atonement for them alone. Everyone else be damned. Everything else is in subservience to his goals of glorifying himself by his undeserved gracious actions on behalf of the few elect. Calvinists seem to me, anyway, to be more faithful about what the Bible actually says in some cases. But since the Bible was written by many different voices there are inconsistencies among these very voices. In any case, pointing out the horrors of creation doesn’t seem to concern these Calvinists simply because all of creation is in rebellion against God and deserves nothing but the fruit their sins deserve, hell. So any morsel of divine gracious bestowed on creation is undeserved. Some theists are not even persuaded that all species are linked in an evolutionary chain but were specially created in a literal six day creation week. Just like Van Inwagen and process theologians must be dealt with separately, so also the Calvinists, so also the literal six day creationists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps God’s goodness and love aren’t like what we humans mean by goodness and love? Perhaps God’s goodness is unlike our goodness such that it’s like the difference between night and day? What we call evil, or darkness, God calls good, or daylight? What is known as good to him isn’t what we would call good at all, so the presence of so much animal suffering is really good after all. We just have a false sense of what goodness is, because we have a limited understanding of just what goodness means?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps God really isn’t all powerful? Perhaps God cannot just do anything he wants to do? He may have wanted to do differently by creating a perfect world, but he didn’t have the necessary power to do so. He had to create slowly through such a long evolutionary process because he had no other choice, and this created world is better for having been created as it is, rather than not being created at all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps God is so omniscient we cannot fathom his purposes for having created the world in the manner he did and for creating animals that prey on one another? As limited human beings with limited understanding God’s ways are inscrutable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps it’s just not God’s fault for the intense suffering his creatures experience in this world? He created a good world but his creatures rebelled against him, either in an angelic rebellion with Satan leading a war against heaven on earth, or human beings themselves chose to disobey and rebel against their creator? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this book I’ll deal with these Christian answers, along with several others when it comes to the problem of natural evil and with it the horrendous sufferings of nearly all living creatures on earth. But one thing is sure when it comes to the specific problem of animal suffering for the Christian faith. Some of the traditional Christian responses to this problem simply do not apply and therefore cannot be used to help. Animals don't suffer because of their own sinful free-will choices to kill or be killed, and so the fall of animals through their own choices is not a satisfactory answer at all. Unlike other Christian responses to morally evil choices whereby it’s claimed humans brought suffering upon themselves, such a theodicy cannot apply to why animals suffer. Animals just do what they do. No one has proposed they are sinning when they eat one another, for instance. They are not guilty of any wrongdoing. Hence, they are not suffering because of doing anything wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nor are there any moral lessons animals can learn from their sufferings as an answer for why they suffer, unlike the responses for why humans might suffer in this world. It is claimed by Christians that through our sufferings we humans learn to be courageous, or patient, or trusting, or giving, or that such sufferings strengths our character in other ways. We are told that our sufferings “try our souls.” We are told they test our character. And we are told that if we overcome them God will be pleased with us for choosing to believe and to act morally in this world in response to God, thereby gaining as our reward for faith and action with a heavenly bliss for doing so. But these same things cannot be said of animals, who just do what they do naturally as part of the natural world. They learn no moral lessons to outweigh the sufferings they experience in the natural world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole notion that animals shall be compensated for their sufferings in heaven is another Christian response that is less likely for some of the same reasons it’s troubling to think humans themselves will be rewarded in heaven, but for additional reasons. Not the least of which is the question which animals will be in heaven and why, if they are at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian scholar Robert N. Wennberg, professor of philosophy at Westmont College, Santa Barbara, California, tells us: “It is not that animal pain and suffering exacerbates the problem of evil by adding to the pain and suffering in the world. Rather, animal suffering intensifies the problem of evil….[A]nimals suffer, innocent of sin and without guilt, who cannot be morally or spiritually benefited by the ravages of pain, who cannot place any meaningful or elevating interpretation upon their suffering, and who will not (according to most) be compensated for their suffering by another life beyond the grave. It would seems that some animals have been brought into existence only to suffer and die, and possibly along the way be put to use by humans: killed for food and clothing, harnessed as beast of burden, hunted for sport, experimented upon, and in general valued only to the extent that they contribute one way or another to the satisfaction of human interests. And so the question emerges: how can we understand animal pain and suffering so as to make peace with a vision of a God whose compassion extends to all of his creatures.” [God, Humans and Animals: An Invitation to Enlarge Our Moral Universe (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003), pp. 310-11]. Peter Van Inwagen concurs when he wrote: “Since non-human animals presumably do not have free will, and since some (most, in fact) of the sufferings of non-human animals occurred before there were human beings, no extension or elaboration of the free-will defense can account for all animal suffering.” [The Problem of Evil, p. 113]. Michael J. Murray concludes that “the standard explanations seem largely impotent when it comes to explaining non-human animal suffering, making the Darwinian problem of evil all the more intractable.” [Nature Red in Tooth and Claw, p. 6]. Yes, indeed!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------&lt;br&gt;As always I need your financial help to continue my research (These books are very expensive--Murray's book was $63; Hasker's book, &lt;em&gt;Providence Evil and the Openness of God&lt;/em&gt; was $136, although luckily it was given to me; there are others I need). I'm very thankful for the few people who have also helped me from having to get a second job in these rough economic times. Where are the atheists who have money?

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone remember "Professor" Bill Nelson, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/scio_and_quantum_xrroid_consciousness_in.php"&gt;cross-dressing "inventor"&lt;/a&gt; who created a most amazing woo machine? I've written about it three times before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/your_friday_dose_of_woo_miraculous_quest_1.php"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo: Miraculous quest for the quantum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/04/your_friday_dose_of_woo_serious_woo_from.php"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo: Serious woo from Down Under&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/scio_and_quantum_xrroid_consciousness_in.php"&gt;The SCIO, Quantum Xrroid Consciousness Interface, and Bill Nelson: Better late than never--or maybe not&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy sells his device for $20,000 a pop and claims he sells 40 machines a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, check out this &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt; episode, &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2009/miracle_makers_or_money_takers/main.html"&gt;Miracle Makers or Money Takers?&lt;/a&gt; Watch the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It never ceases to amaze me that people fall for this stuff. Here we have flamboyantly sociopathic cross-dressing scammer who's on the lam having his minions sell this expensive piece of junk in Canada. For some reason, Health Canada licensed it for "reduction of stress." Why, I don't know, but it was the foot in the door for Nelson to market his device as a cure for cancer, autism, heart disease--pretty much anything you want. Truly, it is the woo for all seasons, and there's one born every minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all, the show did some tests, and the test results show that the "interface" was only delivering pulses of around 5 mV, and the engineer who did the test said that this couldn't possibly have any healing effect on the body. One wonders what cost so many thousands of dollars to produce such an instrument. That engineer must be one of those nasty close-minded reductionist scientists who just don't understand Bill Nelson's genius. After all, the "scientific studies" he sent to the reporter were nothing more than collections of testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in quackery, &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/2009/miracle_makers_or_money_takers/main.html"&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently nothing is too ridiculous that scammers won't do it and someone somewhere won't fall for it. People like Joy, who commented after the video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This device works on a quantum level. It is beyond people's understanding at this time. Anybody who deals with energy work like Reiki realizes that this really works. It does not cure but rather prepares the body to heal itself. If you are not ready and willing to heal yourself it does not work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't that what so many quacks say? If you don't get better, it's your fault because you don't believe enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_friday_woo_in_the_news.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/3yTlyVK8oPo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1234020407349"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_594.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16c6d4e2baf3d1bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-07T13:34:47Z</published><updated>2009-02-07T13:34:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/vUJuNZZ1g6M/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_594.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_594.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_594.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since there’s a good chance, because a.) you’re reading Craigslist and b.) you’re reading the Northern Michigan section - that you’re homeless or close to becoming so, this is the perfect oven for you–it requires no electricity, and flip it over (it’s shaped like a parabola) and use it as a house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With this Death Ray, lovingly handmade from refrigerator boxes and $30 worth of tinfoil, you could literally cook your Christmas ham and all the sides–at the same time. At over four feet tall and approximately six feet wide (when assembled) the Death Ray is sure to fill all of your cooking, living, and vaporizing needs.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as entrepreneurial folks like this are still around, we’ll be ok.   &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime you need some fast amusement, the &lt;a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/all/"&gt;Best of Craig’s List&lt;/a&gt; is a good spot to surf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"I'd rather eat a live Madagascan hissing cockroach than see a hundred comments on the above."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reaction was to wonder "Madagascan?" I always thought it was "Madagascar hissing cockroach", with the simple place name used as a modifier. A quick check verified that Geoff's version is indeed in the minority, 3,180 to 24,200, though not nearly by a large enough factor to explain my confusion. (It also &lt;a href="http://www.luxist.com/2006/04/15/giant-madagascar-hissing-cockroach-brooch/"&gt;turned up&lt;/a&gt; the image reproduced on the right, which suggests that there are some people out there who might actually enjoy eating Madagascar hissing cockroaches.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Anyhow, I realized that I wasn't quite sure what the derived adjectival form for Madagascar really is, except for Malagasy, which I thought of as being specialized for the language. (Though it isn't, apparently.) The OED has Madagascan, Madagascarene, Madagascarian, and Madagascrian, with all of them linked to Madagascan, which links to Malagasy as well, and also Malagache. On the web, Malagasy beats Madagascan, 5.3 million to 266 thousand (though it would be a big mistake to conclude that "Malagasy hissing cockroach" is the favored form for the insect pictured above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the other alternatives are all less common, though Google claims to find 21 million hits for Madagascarene. I&amp;#39;m skeptical of this figure — Yahoo only finds 351 (that&amp;#39;s three hundred and fifty one, with no zeros after it), and MSN finds 37. Google&amp;#39;s extravagant count in this case seems to be the result of over-enthusiastic spelling correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madagascarese is out there on the web as well, but not in impressive numbers or contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the variants? As the OED explains, it's partly thanks to the Madagascans themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[There is a division in Malagasy between dialects with /d/ and dialects with /l/, which accounts for the coexistence of forms in &lt;em&gt;Mal-&lt;/em&gt; and forms in &lt;em&gt;Mad-&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of it, it's just the typically quasi-regular patterning of derivational morphology, which happens to be especially erratic in the case of English adjectival forms of place names. (See e.g. "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=13"&gt;The evolutionary psychology of irregular morphology&lt;/a&gt;", 4/10/2008.)&lt;/p&gt;

An employee at the Dawn School in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has allegedly been stealing medication from students at the school, yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_144218.asp"&gt;Chattanooan&lt;/a&gt; reports. One student who has Asperger's Syndrome, and also obsessive compulsive disorder and bipolar disorder, had been having a "difficult time controlling his behavior" in recent weeks. His mother, Kim MIller, was told that he would have to be put into "Valley Psychiatric Hospital because something was wrong with him"----it turns out that he had been taking empty capsules for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the presumptions that people have about individuals with disabilities seem sadly---incorrigibly---endless: Did the employee even think that the student would not notice the difference in his medication? Not only was the employee taking someone else's medication (to what end, it's not specified), but her doing so may have caused the one student to have difficulties great enough for the school to suggest placement in a psychiatric hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not an employee one would want to have on staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit late on this one, but better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The opinionated and ill-informed actress turned talk show host, Jeni Barnett, spent an hour or so endangering your children (and hers) with what most surely be one of the worst ever accounts of measles vaccination.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chart shows the result of the activities of people like her (see &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7872541.stm"&gt;BBC report&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/_45449024_measles_cases226x240.gif" alt=""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chart from &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7872541.stm"&gt;BBC report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was abominably rude to a well-informed nurse who phoned in to try to inject some sense into the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LBC tried to stop &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; from publicising this horrific show by legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogs are the new journalism. The response has been wonderful.  People of all ages sat up late into the night transcribing the entire broadcast.  Unlike the doubtless highly-paid actress, they did it as a public service.  They were not paid by anyone.  It is all rather beautiful..  Within a day of the legal notice being sent to Goldacre, the offensive broadcast has spread like wildfire over the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this hard work is that if you type ‘Jeni Barnett MMR’ into Google, every item but one on the first page links to the sites that are highly critical of Barnett’s irresponsible and ill-mannered rant (at 7 am on 7 Feb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Bad_Science:_Jeni_Barnett_MMR_and_vaccination_slot_on_LBC_radio%2C_2009"&gt; listen to the entire broadcast here&lt;/a&gt;.  Or read the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/jeni_barnett_mmr_show_-_full_t.php"&gt;entire transcript  here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The many people who have put work into this effort are listed, for example, on &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;Ben Goldacre’s own site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/05/jeni-barnett-lbc-radio-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;Holfordwatch&lt;/a&gt; lists many links, and also lists previous attempts of lawyers to suppress science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When will people learn that lawyers are not the proper way to settle matters of truth and falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice,&lt;em&gt; n&lt;/em&gt; . Small polka-dotted cubes of ivory, constructed like a lawyer to lie on any side, but commonly the wrong one. [ Bierce, Ambrose , &lt;em&gt;The Enlarged Devil's Dictionary&lt;/em&gt; , 1967]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of commentators, &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/05/jeni-barnett-lbc-radio-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;on Holfordwatch&lt;/a&gt;, grows by the minute.  The story rapidly spread to the USA: for example the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/help_ben_goldacre.php"&gt;excellent Orac&lt;/a&gt; has spoken eloquently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condemnation extends far beyond the usual bad medicine writers.   Anyone who wants to speak the truth as they see it sees legal actions like these as a threat to freedom of speech. A side effect is that I learned about several new blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, with a name as good as its content is &lt;strong&gt;A Somewhat Old, But Capacious Handbag&lt;/strong&gt;, written by (you guessed it) Miss Prism, has &lt;a href="http://capacioushandbag.blogspot.com/2009/02/todays-irresponsible-tripe-courtesy-of.html"&gt;Today’s irresponsible tripe courtesy of Jeni Barnett&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one that was new to me is the &lt;strong&gt;Black Triangle blog&lt;/strong&gt;, written by Dr Anthony Cox (a pharmacovigilance pharmacist). He writes in &lt;a href="http://www.blacktriangle.org/blog/?p=1898"&gt;Conspiracy?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccinators have exploited the internet for years. Websites, blogs, and forums are widely used by activists to promote their wrong-headed cause. However, when the pro-science pro-vaccine lobby use similar methods a common accusation is leveled at them. Here it is posted at JABS, the UK’s leading anti-vaccine website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no way all of this could have happened so quickly without Pharma backing.” “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is really priceless. These anti-vaccination fanatics just don’t seem to be able to grasp that there is a big army of people who care so much about the public interest that they do all this for no money and a considerable cost to themselves in time and lost sleep.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Besides which, anyone who thinks that a big corporation could whip up so much support and activity in 24 hours obviously has a rather better opinion of the efficiency of big companies than I do. They’d need 25 meetings and an awayday in Majorca before anything happened . Even a university can do better than that (perhaps only 20 meetings and an awayday in Uxbridge). One does wonder why, then, universities are always being told to be more like businesses. But that is another story.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Anthony Cox&lt;/strong&gt; also deals with another of my favourite topics in &lt;a href="http://www.blacktriangle.org/blog/?p=1894"&gt;The Today Programme’s irresponsible MMR interview&lt;/a&gt;.  I listen to the &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm"&gt;Today Programme&lt;/a&gt;, I listen every morning.  But I do wish they could bring their medical reporting up to the same standard as their political reporting. Their policy of ‘equal time for the flat earth society” is not my idea of impartiality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/strong&gt; for 8th February, by coincidence, has a major article by the excellent investigative reporter, &lt;a title="Brian Deer&amp;#39;s site" href="http://briandeer.com/"&gt;Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent summary has appeared already Dynutrix on &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/08/brian-deer-discusses-andrew-wakefield-in-the-sunday-times/"&gt;Holfordwatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1.&lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece"&gt;MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, our investigation, confirmed by evidence presented to the General Medical Council (GMC), reveals that: In most of the 12 cases, the children’s ailments as described in The Lancet were different from their hospital and GP records. Although the research paper claimed that problems came on within days of the jab, in only one case did medical records suggest this was true, and in many of the cases medical concerns had been raised before the children were vaccinated. Hospital pathologists, looking for inflammatory bowel disease, reported in the majority of cases that the gut was normal. This was then reviewed and the Lancet paper showed them as abnormal. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2. &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683642.ece"&gt;MMR: Key Dates in the Crisis &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 3. Most shockingly &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683643.ece"&gt;Hidden    records show MMR truth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“A Sunday Times investigation has found that altered data was behind the decade-long scare over vaccination ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 4. &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683687.ece"&gt;How the MMR scare led to the return of measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s hope that some of the original documents appear on-line soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Times&lt;/strong&gt; on 10 February carried a beautifully hard-hitting column by David Aaronovitch: &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article5696902.ece"&gt;The preposterous prejudice of the anti-MMR lobby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last week there was a bust-up in blogland.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Last week, justifying herself on her blog, Barnett invoked the spirit of the insurgent ignoramus. Yes, she said, she should have been ready with facts and figures on MMR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s why I’m passionately for Goldacre, and why &lt;strong&gt;I find myself wondering     whether we can file a class action against LBC for permitting a presenter  to inflict her preposterous prejudices on her listeners, to the detriment of someone else’s kids&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jeni Barnett: have you lost something?&lt;/strong&gt;. Well well, first Jeni Barnett removed the critical comments from her blog.  Then she removed the blog altogether.  Seems she isn’t interested in debate at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither does she understand the internet.  You can &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/Jeni_Barnett_MM_%20and_Me.pdf"&gt;read the missing blog here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/jeni-barnett-have-you-lost-something.html"&gt;the invaluable Quackometer&lt;/a&gt; has reproduced the whole blog post &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; all the missing comments. Great work Andy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen Fry&lt;/strong&gt; left a &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/#comments"&gt;comment (#223) on Goldacre’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fatuity of the Jeni Barnett woman’s manner - her blend of self-righteousness and stupidity, her simply quite staggering inability to grasp, pursue or appreciate a sequence of logical steps - all these are signature characteristics of Britain these days. The lamentable truth is that most of the population wouldn’t really understand why we get so angry at this assault on reason, logic and sense. But we have to keep hammering away at these people and their superstitious inanities. We have to. Well done you and well done all you supporting. I’ve tweeted this site to my followers. I hope they all do their best to support you. Publish and be damned. We’ll fight them and fight them and fight them in the name of empricism, reason, double blind random testing and all that matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goldacre posted a clip of a radio program where UK anti-vaccinationist Jeni Barnett spouted out a whole lot of stupid, so now she wants her own words silenced before her reputation is destroyed. And so the suit seems to revolve around Goldacre’s supposed unauthorized use of copyrighted material. Oddly, nobody seems to mind terribly that millions and millions of ordinary joes on the internet do this all the time. No, only when someone wishes to bully a critic with unnecessary litigation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But of course now we live in the internet age and so now that so much attention has been put on it, you can find the clip all over the place, such as &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/leak/jeni-barnett-mmr-and-vaccination-slot-on-lbc.mp3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and on YouTube beginning&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dRnkmw-_L4&amp;amp;feature=channel_page"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;thanks to Rachel Dunlop. &lt;span&gt;Enjoy. And please save a copy of the clip because it’ll probably go down again. If enough people copy the audio file, every time it goes down, more will spring up like the heads of a hydra. You can also find the full transcript &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/jeni_barnett_mmr_show_-_full_t.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an example of one of her little gems of insight:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to know from some kind of expert what measles is and what is in the vaccine, and why people have a reaction to it, and really my question is: what is wrong with childhood illnesses? Is it - to hark back to the first hour - because we don’t have parents at home looking after the children? What’s going on? Is there something wrong with having mumps…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s be perfectly clear as we analyze what she said here. She doesn’t know what measles is, or what’s in the vaccine, or what’s wrong with childhood illnesses, or what’s the problem with mumps… &lt;em&gt;but she goes on the radio railing against vaccination?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she actually suggests that flu vaccines are supposed to prevent the common cold. This perhaps more than anything else illustrates her utter ignorance of that which she is talking about.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And she’s still yammering on about this BS on her blog, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/help_ben_goldacre.php#more"&gt;as Orac reports&lt;/a&gt;, while still admitting herself that she has no scientific or medical training and thus doesn’t know what she’s talking about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course this comes after &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7872541.stm"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;/span&gt;measles cases rose 36% in 2008 over the previous year, from 990 to 1348. And of course despite Jeni Barnett’s claims that measles are perfectly safe, it can lead to pneumonia and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;

Michelangelo is a character in the story, but the book's writer is mother to a real world Michelangelo, who, like the Michelangelo of the story, loves the ocean and all the diversity it holds.  And that real world Michelangelo, as stated in the book's dedication, has a diagnosis of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like both Michelangelos, I too love the ocean and all the diversity it holds.  I grew up on the wild coast of Maine, the extreme north eastern point of the U.S. against the Atlantic, and many of my fondest childhood memories are of exploring the shore.  I'm also highly fond of dreams--both dreams in the sense of what is experienced during sleep and in the sense of aspirations.  Both the ocean (symbolic of the unconscious) and dreams (in both senses) figure predominantly in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What doesn't figure in the story is the word "autism."  So while I wanted to blog a review of the book in this space, I kept wondering--does this book have an autism theme?  Outside of the dedication and the obvious connection between the two Michelangelos, is this book at all about autism?  I flip-flopped--on one hand, it's a really universal story about dreams and the potential to reach them.  On the other hand, I was left with a strong sense because of the dedication that there was a specific message too: dreams don't have to end because of an autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, there are some themes that simply are universal--it doesn't matter whether you're a parent, a child, a person with a disability, a person without a disability, a person labeled autistic, or a person with no label at all.  The neat thing about universal themes is that they are, well, universal: they apply to nearly everyone.  New dreams can replace old, and sometimes the spark of inspiration for a new dream comes from an unexpected source, be that as rarefied as the ocean of sleep or as concrete as "Andy the Diver" giving a presentation at the aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, Elwes' illustrations--yummy little paintings of sea creatures and under-sea-scapes!  (Did I mention I have a great love for the ocean and all the diversity it contains?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a fun story for kids, but it, like the ocean, has depths that make it age-appropriate reading for adults as well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233968766232"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-6932765376367642859">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/18b4db4409d0ca66</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Action" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bullshit" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Skepticism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Bigfoot Begins!</title><published>2009-02-06T22:09:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T22:09:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/02/bigfoot-begins.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SYy1hibsfYI/AAAAAAAAAiI/8Gaqoi_iFgw/s1600-h/bigfoot.gif"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:298px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SYy1hibsfYI/AAAAAAAAAiI/8Gaqoi_iFgw/s320/bigfoot.gif" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am shortly leaving for &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2009/01/no-fuckin-way-man-you-know-hes-real.html"&gt;my weekend road trip around Indiana&lt;/a&gt; to look for the elusive Indiana sasquatch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm bringing my laptop, so if I'm lucky, I can find some place along the way with wireless and leave a quick post each day we're out there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will we find anything?

We will be meeting Dr. Yvette Cook from the Rex Hospital Sleep Disorders Clinic.  She will be talking with us about sleep patterns and why people may have trouble getting a good night's sleep.  I have attached an article Dr. Cook recently wrote for a Rex Healthcare newsletter that you may find of interest.  I hope that many of you can come - it should be a very interesting and informative discussion.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep and Sleep Disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday, February 17, 2009&lt;br&gt;
6:30-8:30 pm with discussion beginning at 7:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;br&gt;
Location: The Irregardless Café, 901 W. Morgan Street, Raleigh 833-8898&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of sleep and dreams has been a subject of interest for centuries. But it took discoveries by scientists (electrical activity of the brain, Rapid Eye Movement sleep) to spur the creation of a new clinical field -- Sleep Medicine. The ensuing creation of the polysomnogram (sleep study) has been instrumental in helping sleep physicians evaluate different sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, restless legs, sleepwalking and narcolepsy. Now the general population and the medical community are beginning to recognize the impact of sleep disorders on society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yvette R. Cook is a Diplomate of the American Board of Sleep Medicine and Fellow of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. She has a private practice in Cary (Cary Neurology &amp;amp; Sleep Disorders, Inc.) specializing in the field of sleep medicine and serves as Medical Director of Rex Sleep Disorders Center, an accredited Sleep Center devoted to the evaluation of patients with sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/02/06/bill-gates-malaria-and-mosquitoes/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/ppDWD3VwxVg/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it only takes a few comments on the TED page until the “bring back DDT” drivel appears.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you actually watch the &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_unplugged.html"&gt;complete talk&lt;/a&gt;, you see that Malaria was  NEVER eradicated in the equatorial areas, with or without DDT.  As I have said &lt;a title="why we failed" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2008/09/11/why-we-failed-on-malaria/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="cliff notes" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/06/29/ddt-and-attacks-on-rachel-carson-the-cliffsnote-version/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="insecticide resistance" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/ddt-malaria-insecticide-resistance/"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;, malaria is a complicated problem, and no single chemical will be the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of Microsoft, but I give Gates big props for trying to do something constructive with his money.  Bill also talks about what makes good teachers…good.  Very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems (see &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/feb/06/carol-thatcher-multiple-golliwog-remarks"&gt;this story in The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;) that she not only called Congolese-French tennis player &lt;a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=435"&gt;Jo-Wilfried Tsonga&lt;/a&gt; a golliwog (Americans often don't know this word, but it refers to a traditional style of stereotyped black-faced rag doll), and did so more than once, but also called him a "half-golliwog" and a "golliwog frog".  These previously unreported details are crucial. They make it clear that it was not some innocent comment regarding visual resemblance to a children's toy.  "Half-golliwog" makes it clear that she really was using "golliwog" for "person of (predominantly) negroid racial type". That's the only plausible way to make "half-golliwog" interpretable.  She was referring to his mixed race, and defining him by it. That truly is racist talk.  She'd call my son Calvin a half-golliwog given one more half glass of white wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the British people as a whole aren't coming out of this looking very good. Messages to the BBC backing the discontinuing of Thatcher's role in The One Show number about 135 so far (a tiny number given the viewing figures).  But the number of complaints attacking them for axing her have gone way over 3,000.   For every person writing in to support the action against Thatcher, more than twenty people back her to the hilt.  (Or appear to.  Quite a lot of it is probably organized BBC-bashing by conservatives who want to strip the BBC of its license-fee income.  They lash out at the BBC's management no matter what it does.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in &lt;i&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt; the right-wing incendiary-bomb columnist Melanie Phillips rapidly issued a &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1136091/Controller-gives-chilling-insight-totalitarian-universe-closed-BBC-mind.html"&gt;wild, over-the-top rant&lt;/a&gt; about jobs being snatched away by the thought police for mere innocent private chat. &amp;quot;Does that mean therefore that any BBC employee who makes an injudicious remark to a group of colleagues anywhere in the building — in the newsroom, in the lift, in the loo even — can expect to find themselves snitched upon to the BBC commissariat and have their employment summarily terminated forthwith?&amp;quot;, she asks rhetorically.  (No, I suspect, is the answer.  But loud prattle of an overtly racist nature while drinking wine on BBC premises during working hours in front of a number of semi-strangers was apparently judged beyond the pale.  You&amp;#39;d think conservatives would want to see some standards of behavior enforced on people who are paid out of the BBC&amp;#39;s governmentally enforced license fee income, wouldn&amp;#39;t you?)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now rumors about a big article by Thatcher in the &lt;i&gt;Mail On Sunday&lt;/i&gt; this weekend (though that would involve a judgment call on her part: she does want to do more freelance work for the BBC, and by attacking the corporation too fiercely she might be burning her bridges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, this is developing into a downer.  Let's take stock of some of the UK-related linguistic good news this weekend:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;British film actor Christian Bale has sincerely &lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2009/02/christian-bal-2.html"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; for instructing his director of photography during work time last year to fucking keep the fuck out of his fucking sight line and not fucking walk around the fucking set during a fucking shot if he didn't want his fucking ass kicked, and then demanding to know what fucking part of this he didn't fucking understand.  (You see, Bale was distracted while he was working, and felt impelled to remonstrate with his valued crew member for a full four minutes.  Look it up on YouTube.  It's not quite as hilarious as people say, so I can't be bothered to link to it.)  The apology is to all of us; star and photography director are friends again now.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;British TV personality Jeremy Clarkson has apologized for calling the prime minister Gordon Brown &amp;quot;a one-eyed Scottish idiot&amp;quot;.  (You see, Mr Brown lost the sight of one eye in a rugby football accident when he was young, and was born in Scotland.  Clarkson is not in fact — I&amp;#39;m glad you asked — an expert in ocular surgery or clinical psychology; he hosts a program about driving fast cars.  How he had strayed so far from his remit is not clear to me.) He says that on reflection, he apologizes for what he said about Mr Brown&amp;#39;s appearance and ethnicity, but still says he&amp;#39;s an idiot.  Two out of three isn&amp;#39;t bad.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caroline Petrie, the nurse who was suspended for offering a prayer for a patient's health, has been allowed to return to work.  (You see, in the USA, where religion is strictly excluded from government, there is government approval of faith-based health and social services; but in the UK, where religion is firmly established as a part of the governmental structure and the Queen is the head of the Church of England as well as the Head of State, you are not allowed to bring your theistic mumblings into a state-funded hospital workplace.  I know it's confusing, but I don't make the rules; I just try to report the linguistic news of the week.)   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don't tell me there's no good news on the linguistic scene!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also don't ask me why comments on this post are closed.  I've mentioned British racism, Margaret Thatcher's daughter, the negro race, tennis, Congo, France, the BBC, politics, Melanie Phillips, the &lt;i&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/i&gt;, Christian Bale, the f-bomb, Gordon Brown, idiocy, Scotland, rugby football, cars, faith-based health care, Queen Elizabeth, and the Church of England. It would be troll city down there if I opened comments. It would be an act of sheer madness.  Just look at some of the off-topic rudeness and dogmatism in the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1110#comments"&gt;comments on the earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.  I'd rather eat a live Madagascan hissing cockroach than see a hundred comments on the above.  I'd rather have a glass of white wine with Carol Thatcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#007700"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[There&amp;#39;s no escape from cyberspace, of course, and I&amp;#39;m now getting hostile email from the would-be comments trolls.  One thing that I notice is that some people write as if the U.S. constitution gave people the right to permanent employment with the BBC.  (The British constitution certainly can&amp;#39;t: first, it isn&amp;#39;t written down, and second, there are absolutely no guaranteed free speech rights in the UK.)  To get continued work on a BBC TV program, it&amp;#39;s not enough merely to avoid being arrested.  You have to be personable, interesting, watchable . . . and yes, you have to respect whatever the BBC management thinks is a reasonable standard of behavior on the premises.  Nobody is putting Carol Thatcher in prison for thinking that calling a young Congolese-French sportsman a &amp;quot;half-golliwog&amp;quot; in front of colleagues is funny.  But the BBC has absolutely no duty to hand further freelance assignments to a woman if her own program producers think she has become an embarrassment.   —GKP]&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm a little bit shocked to see this new group capitalizing on their good name: &lt;a href="http://www.hom-og.de/index.php?id=233&amp;amp;L=1"&gt;Homeopaths Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;. They've got to be joking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is our main aim to transfer homeopathy to those countries, where public health care and medical supply of the people is sub-standard, for whatever reasons. Homeopathy also proves very effective in healing physical and mental injury in situations of war or political crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If their health care is substandard, isn't it rather cruel to charge in and make it worse?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/rename_it_to_quackery_without.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/b3MI93VltYU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233958666343"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_research_under_obama_will_there_be_an_autism_czar">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0fde8269c606abf5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Autism Research Under Obama: Will there be an autism czar?</title><published>2009-02-06T21:08:00Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T21:08:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_research_under_obama_will_there_be_an_autism_czar" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Queen\&amp;#39;s crown by Sunfox" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/338660082_a4b63187f9_m.jpg" height="180" alt="Queen&amp;#39;s crown on Sunfox" width="240"&gt;Dora's recent post on whether there's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/nih_funding_too_much_for_autism"&gt;too much NIH funding for autism&lt;/a&gt; sparked a lot of discussion. The question was timely: Scientists and researchers are predicting that research on autism will "prosper" under President Obama, according to an article by Virginia Hughes on the website of the &lt;a href="http://sfari.org/news/autism-research-expected-to-prosper-under-obama"&gt;Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;[Disclaimer: I'm quoted in the article.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the &lt;a href="http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2009/02/02/daily30-Picower-Institute-finds-autism-genetic-link.html"&gt;Journal of New England Technology&lt;/a&gt; reported that MIT's &lt;a href="http://www.masshightech.com/search.html?q=Picower%20Institute%20for%20Learning%20and%20Memory&amp;amp;t=1"&gt;Picower Institute for Learning and Memory&lt;/a&gt; has ceased operations due to ".....heavy losses sustained from the collapse of fraudulent money manager Bernard Madoff’s fund, the local and national press has reported"----will other sources of funding for autism research be affected, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism was given specific mention on the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_autism_whitehousegov"&gt;Whitehouse website&lt;/a&gt; and it's been noted that, on his &lt;a href="https://donate.barackobama.com/page/contribute/dnc08splashnd"&gt;official campaign website&lt;/a&gt;, Obama has called for the creation of an "autism czar" who would (as Hughes's article says)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;..... oversee research on autism, eliminate bureaucracy, and coordinate autism-related agencies at state and local levels. The website added that Obama would fully fund the 2006 &lt;a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/government_affairs/white_house_caa_facts.php"&gt;Combating Autism Act&lt;/a&gt;, which earmarked nearly $1 billion in autism-related federal funding over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any suggestions for potential candidates for what promises to be a job calling for understanding of disability and diversity, a great deal of diplomacy skills, and a really thick skin?&lt;/p&gt;

The History Channel, really a publicity agency they higher, sent me this DVD in the mail to review.   It promises Snakes, Curses, and Booby Traps, which it tries to deliver on (though I don’t really see how it can deliver actual curses since they do not exist.)  The text on the DVD packaging essentially promises to compare archaeologists to their fictional counterparts, fighting, hunting, exploring, surviving, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the DVD searches for the most heroic and embellished stories of archaeologies past, focusing on the Indiana Jones of our discipline.   Needless to say, this not only leaves out about 99% of archaeology, such as analysis, lab work, teaching, preservation, begging for money, and the like, but it leaves out probably 75% of the history of modern archaeology.  In short, archaeologists no longer focus on the looking, killing, fighting lifestyles of Laura Croft.   The heroes the History Channel talks about are almost all dead now, and fall into what we call Culture-Historic archaeology.   This is the pre-science discipline of archaeology.  It is also generally the period, as not really seen in this DVD, of racist colonial archaeologists exploiting and stealing from indigenous peoples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the theoretical and heroic focus of this DVD, it is also really focused on elite Archaeology.  There is nothing really looking at prehistoric sites, small non-elite sites, or the post-processual ideas of the non-vocal minorities (ie women).   Instead one can expect Egyptian, Grecco-Roman, Mayan,  and Inka sites.  This is somewhat disappointing to me as an archaeologist, since so much of the really great stuff being found is ignored by the History Channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this DVD doesn’t deliver very well concerning the actual nature of archaeology or the modern concerns of archaeologists, it does have one good section.  There is an extesive part of the DVD focused on explaining looting and the increasing importance of cultural heritage in determining the outcome of archaeological excavations.   For this section alone, I actually do recommend this DVD.  The stories involved are somewhat over the top, but can serve to impress the importance of the issue on non-professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, I would not suggest that anyone consider this DVD an actual view of the “real tomb hunters” as much as this can be used as a euphemism for archaeologists.  However, it does offer a somewhat entertaining look at the outdated Culture-historic period of archaeology (think of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/accessing_academic_accommodations_an_interview_with_jennifer_parker"&gt;I got pretty excited about Jennifer&lt;/a&gt; who not only has specific expertise working with students with invisible disabilities (including autism), but is also a special education attorney. So I hit Jennifer up for more than one interview. Here&amp;#39;s the first, continuing the themes that were explored in the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; post--why can it be so hard to get seemingly simple accommodations from teachers? Is this a problem with individual teachers, with teacher education, with the educational system, with--with what?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Here&amp;#39;s the beginning of the second interview:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thursday I posted Jennifer Parker&amp;#39;s take on why it can be difficult for students on the autistic spectrum to get academic accommodations. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_education_and_the_law_interview_2_with_jennifer_parker"&gt;Now with more of her attorney hat on, I&amp;#39;ve asked Jennifer some questions more about the legal and self-advocacy side of academic accommodations at the primary and secondary school leve&lt;/a&gt;l.

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dora: Give me a brief summary of the laws that govern special education and public school accommodations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer:&lt;/strong&gt; Section 504 is a civil rights law that allows medical and classroom accommodations for children with disabilities who do not require special education services. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures that all children with disabilities have a free appropriate public education that emphasizes education that meets their unique needs.

First, the Cleveland Cavaliers are pretty upset that point guard Mo Williams hasn't been selected  for the NBA All-Star game. Teammate Ben Wallace sounded off to the &lt;a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1233307988280320.xml&amp;amp;coll=2"&gt;Cleveland Plain Dealer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a tragedy," Ben Wallace said. "I  think it's an injustice. It's a fraud. We've  got the best record in the league, and we've only got  one guy going. You always make it the next year, after the  year you were supposed to make it. It's a travesty and  a sham and a mockery. It's a shamockery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when Williams wasn't even selected to be an All-Star reserve, team owner Dan Gilbert continued the neologistic assault in an email to the &lt;a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/basketball/nba/02/06/cavs.williams.ap/index.html"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ben Wallace was right when he called Mo originally being passed over for the  All-Star game a shamockery," Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert said in a  tongue-in-cheek e-mail to &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;. "But not naming  him as the natural and obvious replacement for the unfortunately  injured Jameer Nelson is stupidiculous, idillogical and  preposterageous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shamockery&lt;/em&gt;, or more fully &lt;em&gt;traveshamockery&lt;/em&gt; (also spelled &lt;em&gt;travishamockery&lt;/em&gt;), goes back to a 2004 ad campaign for Miller Lite, specifically this campaign-themed "President of Beers" spot featuring comedian Bob Odenkirk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Z4S7wUY94Vs%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odenkirk's &lt;em&gt;traveshamockery&lt;/em&gt; line must surely owe a debt of gratitude to Woody Allen. In his 1971 movie &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066808/quotes"&gt;Bananas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Allen's character Fielding Mellish memorably says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I  object, your honor! This trial is a travesty. It's a travesty of a  mockery of a sham of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a  sham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/8a3mk9sp0oE%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dan Gilbert's neologisms (&lt;em&gt;stupidiculous&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;idillogical&lt;/em&gt; and  &lt;em&gt;preposterageous&lt;/em&gt;) sound vaguely like the self-conscious lexical blends that Snickers rolled out for an ad campaign a few years ago (discussed by Arnold Zwicky &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003514.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;em&gt;nougatocity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt; substantialicious&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;satisfectellent&lt;/em&gt;, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Item #2: While we're on the subject of ad-driven coinages (and professional sports), I would be remiss not to mention one of the more successful commercials from the recent Super Bowl. It's the ubiquitous E*TRADE baby, now mocking his golf partner by calling him &lt;em&gt;shank-a-potamus&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/zZetD7cdj7w%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those unfamiliar with golfing lingo, to &lt;em&gt;shank&lt;/em&gt; a ball is to hit it with the heel of the club, causing it to veer in the wrong direction.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/golf/story/9170064/Monday-Scramble:-The-Dubai-kid"&gt;Golfweek&lt;/a&gt; has already dubbed &lt;em&gt;shank-a-potamus&lt;/em&gt; "the Word of the Year thus far." It's no &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=885"&gt;ozay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, but okay.&lt;/p&gt;

After all, the U.K. has some of the most plaintiff-friendly libel laws in the world, far more so than here in the U.S., in that in a libel case it is up to the defendant to prove that what he wrote is true, not the plaintiff to prove it false and defamatory. Just go back to 2000 and the most depressing exhibition of that very principle, namely disgraced pseudohistorian &lt;a href="http://www.hdot.org/"&gt;David Irving's libel suit&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href="http://lipstadt.blogspot.com"&gt;Professor Deborah Lipstadt&lt;/a&gt; for having referred to him as a Holocaust denier (which he undoubtedly is) in her book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Denying-Holocaust-Growing-Assault-Memory/dp/0452272742/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b"&gt;Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory&lt;/a&gt;. It happened to Ben before when HIV/AIDS denialist quack Matthias Rath sued him for libel. Fortunately, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/matthias-rath-pulls-out-forced-to-pay-the-guardians-costs-i-think-this-means-i-win/"&gt;Ben won&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, Ben complained about a DJ named &lt;a href="http://www.lbc.co.uk/jeni-barnett-3530"&gt;Jeni Barnett&lt;/a&gt;, who is clearly an antivaccine nut and not afraid to &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/bad-science-bingo/"&gt;spew her nonsense&lt;/a&gt; on her radio show, throwing out the usual antivaccine canards about big pharma conspiracies, the "science was wrong before" doggerel, and the claim that measles "wasn't so bad." Now, her radio station LBC is threatening to sue Ben over this for "copyright infringement" because Ben had posted a segment of her show in which she ranted on and on about the evils of vaccines. And she's &lt;a href="http://www.jenibarnett.com/2009/02/mmr_and_me.php"&gt;still doing it on her own blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/help_ben_goldacre.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/help_ben_goldacre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/_4p7cm5TAAc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233950217343"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/friday_sprog_blogging_the_righ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f6a9865b5787900</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kids and science"/><title type="html">Friday Sprog Blogging: the rightful place of science.</title><published>2009-02-06T17:15:55Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T17:15:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/qf4XrY755J4/friday_sprog_blogging_the_righ.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/02/friday_sprog_blogging_the_righ.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;By now, you're probably aware of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/rightfulplace.php"&gt;Rightful Place Project&lt;/a&gt;, which is collecting text, images, audio, and video from scientists, engineers, and others involved in conversations about science in response to the question, &lt;b&gt;What is science's rightful place?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Protection Agency experts said most of the cases had been in children not fully vaccinated with combined MMR and so could have been prevented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunisation expert Dr Mary Ramsay said the rise was “very worrying”, adding measles “should not be taken lightly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it shouldn’t, given that it can lead to pneumonia and encephalitis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This news comes on the heels of an antivax diatribe by &amp;quot;journalist&amp;quot; Jeni Barnett on LBC radio in England. Science  advocate Ben Goldacre, who writes Bad Science, takes her to task &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/bad-science-bingo/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on with irrationality: LBC lawyers told Ben to take down the clip of her irrational spewings. Of course, that’s their right; he posted all of it, so they have a copyright claim. However, doing something as dumb as that just means people will take all the more glee to get the word out there, as I’m doing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, it’s still all over the web. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dRnkmw-_L4&amp;amp;feature=channel_page"&gt;It’s on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Rachel Dunlop, for example. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/jeni_barnett_mmr_show_-_full_t.php"&gt;A series of skeptics have posted transcripts of it&lt;/a&gt;, too, so you can read what Ms. Barnett said. You really have to read it for yourself to see the level of nonsense on display, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to know from some kind of expert what measles is and what is in the vaccine, and why people have a reaction to it, and really my question is: what is wrong with childhood illnesses? Is it - to hark back to the first hour - because we don’t have parents at home looking after the children? What’s going on? Is there something wrong with having mumps…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she doesn’t know what measles is, or what’s in the vaccine, or what’s wrong with childhood illnesses, or what’s the problem with mumps… &lt;em&gt;but she goes on the radio railing against vaccination?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What mad world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since sexy jokes are always my favorite, it was really difficult to choose a winner. I think I laughed all the way through the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5866"&gt;Because Only the Priest Can Touch Me There&lt;/a&gt; thread, in which &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5866&amp;amp;cpage=3#comment-50646"&gt;Sethmanpio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5866&amp;amp;cpage=2#comment-50546"&gt;Augustus&lt;/a&gt; were nominated. I nearly gave the win to Augustus right there, but realized that I was being biased by his adorable avatar.&lt;br&gt;
Brian’s a Wild Downer also nearly won thanks to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5775&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-49819"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, in which he makes bestiality sound downright pleasant. However! The winner this week not only referenced male genitalia, but he also managed to work in an in-joke from the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4154"&gt;Skepchick Drink Contest&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The Kiwi. God needed something in nature to look like a tree full of scrotums….hairy, sweaty scrotums that make people feel uncomfortable. The idea was that if he could disquise their tangy interior with a skin that looks like the chin of “that guy” you knew in grade 9 who tried to grow a chin-beard before puberty would let him, then he could train people to like oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause you know, God has got to get some of that poon-flavored tang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll never eat a kiwi in the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;

Now with more of her attorney hat on, I've asked Jennifer some questions more about the legal and self-advocacy side of academic accommodations at the primary and secondary school level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Give me a brief summary of the laws that govern special education and public school accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Section 504 is a civil rights law that allows medical and classroom accommodations for children with disabilities who do not require special education services. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ensures that all children with disabilities have a free appropriate public education that emphasizes education that meets their unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: What is the most common legal issue people face with the special education system? Why might this be so? How do you think might this be addressed more globally so it's no longer an issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: There are four common categories of disputes: eligibility, failure to provide a free, appropriate education (FAPE), failure to implement the IEP, and inappropriate discipline. In my personal experience as an attorney and advocate, eligibility issues are often caused by the school district's attempt to keep numbers down. It looks bad if the district has a high number of children in special education. Also, it can be expensive for the local district since IDEA is underfunded. Inappropriate discipline has several roots. Either the school staff do not understand how the child's disability affects behavior, or the school is not adequately trained in Functional Behavior Assessment/Behavior Plans, or corporeal punishment has been used for years and is entrenched in the school system. I have a case right now where a child has a wonderful IEP with every service and need explicitly outlined in his IEP, but the school is just not implementing it. They have told the parent to go ahead and file a due process complaint against them. Sometimes parents will see brazenness like this because the deck is stacked against the parent in these situations: the parent lacks resources or knowledge about filing for due process, school attorneys have trained the administrative law judges, judges rule for the school a high percentage of the time. In order to address these problems, there needs to be more oversight and monitoring by the U.S. Department of Education and full funding of IDEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: I am going to switch topics slightly from the parent perspective to the student.  A barrier to self-advocacy I've seen is people aren't taught what their rights are, legally. The IEP or 504 processes always seemed like a great way to start teaching people their rights. Is the IEP/504 process ever used that way? Should it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: The student has a right to attend the IEP or 504 meeting and I highly recommend they do so if they are of an appropriate age for the subject matter of the meeting. It is a great way to learn about the process and self-advocate. Schools don't always invite the student, however, or model productive discussions...  Perhaps it's happening in some schools or some districts, but working in the Mid-South, I see some schools hold meetings (illegally) to decide the fate of a child without even inviting the parent. However, I'm a proponent of training school teams to include students in this process and if I were involved with policy or oversight of the special education system it would be a priority for me. I believe that the quality of Individualized Education Plans would be greatly enhanced by input from the student. That's a no-brainer. In the mean time, I encourage students to read as much as they can about education law and either teach themselves or draw from advocacy training offered in the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora: Considering how old school-as-a-system is in the US, how long do you think it will take to change? What do you think is needed to facilitate that change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer: Part of this process will depend on who is chosen to be Deputy Secretary of Education in the Obama Administration. The Deputy Secretary oversees the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. Linda Darling-Hammond is currently rumored to be a candidate for this position and many progressive reformers, myself included, are rooting for this appointment. (You can sign &lt;a href="http://education.change.org/actions/view/appoint_linda_darling-hammond_to_a_top_doe_job"&gt;a petition to appoint Linda Darling-Hammond&lt;/a&gt; to a top DOE position on the &lt;a href="http://education.change.org"&gt;Education&lt;/a&gt; cause blog). It will also depend in some part on the ability of citizens to bring the issues to the forefront and to change some conventional wisdom about education, accountability, and reform...  the good news is I don't think we need to start from scratch with special education law. The law is excellent, the problem is the delivery system. I do believe strongly, however, that we need to scrap No Child Left Behind and just reauthorize ESEA while educators work on developing a better school accountability system.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233945345464"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/the_editors_of_plos_should_rea.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/195362af9a030462</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">The editors of PLoS should read PLoS</title><published>2009-02-06T16:06:22Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T16:06:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/LZii1r_zg0A/the_editors_of_plos_should_rea.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/02/the_editors_of_plos_should_rea.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/539/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/boyfriend.png" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Well, reading &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_119.php"&gt;Bora's blog this week&lt;/a&gt; I saw an article entitled, &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004389"&gt;Risks for Central Nervous System Diseases among Mobile Phone Subscribers: A Danish Retrospective Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt; and my ears perked up.  We have been mocking the idea that cell phones cause everything from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/03/cell_phones_and_cancer_real_or.php"&gt;brain cancer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.denialism.com/2007/04/bill-maher-and-bees.html"&gt;colony collapse disorder&lt;/a&gt; and it's always fun to see what cell phones are being blamed for based on weak associations and correlations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article the authors identified more than four hundred thousand cell phone subscribers and linked their cell phone use to their medical records in the Danish Hospital Discharge Registry which has collected records of hospitalizations since 1977.  They then tried to identify an association between cell phone use and various CNS disorders over the last few decades.  These disorders include epilepsy, ALS, vertigo, migraines, MS, Parkinsons and dementia, a broad spectrum of diseases with a variety of pathologies and causes.  Basically, they're fishing.

Robin is a creative big-picture thinker, who took a twisting career path from physics through philosophy of science and artificial intelligence research to become a tenured professor of economics.  He posed a question, which he just &lt;a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/our-biggest-surprise.html#comments"&gt;re-posed&lt;/a&gt; at his blog:  what is the most surprising thing we’ve learned about the universe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously the right answer depends on a set of expectations; surprising to whom?  I originally suggested quantum mechanics, and in particular the fact that the outcomes of experiments are not perfectly predictable even in principle.   I think that was the most surprising thing to the people who actually discovered it, in the context of what they thought they understood.  But what about the most surprising thing to our pre-scientific hunter-gather ancestors?  I suggested the fact that the same set of rules govern living beings and inanimate matter, but if you have any better ideas feel free to &lt;a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/our-biggest-surprise.html#comments"&gt;chime in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can ask the complementary question:  what is the most surprising thing about the universe that we haven’t yet discovered, but plausibly could?  Something that is not already reasonably excluded by experiments that we’ve done, but also wouldn’t be readily accommodated by a theoretical model.  So “string theory is right” certainly wouldn’t count, but neither would “the proton is heavier than the neutron.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once discussed this with &lt;a href="http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/wimsatt.html"&gt;Bill Wimsatt&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.chicagopublicradio.org/audio_library/ram/od/od_010822.ram"&gt;an episode of Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; (RealPlayer).  I went with “reproducible violations of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.”  But there are plenty of other good possibilities; what if we discovered tachyons, or that there really was an Intelligent Designer?  Suggestions welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

All he has to do is speak the truth, and wham, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/legal-chill-from-lbc-973-over-jeni-barnetts-mmr-scaremongering/"&gt;the kooks charge in&lt;/a&gt;. He recently &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/bad-science-bingo/"&gt;posted a clip from a radio program in which lunatic anti-vaccination nut Jeni Barnett said many stupid things&lt;/a&gt;, so she rushed to silence &lt;i&gt;her own words&lt;/i&gt;. Can't have the fact that she's spluttering nonsense made public, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my view that in this extended broadcast Jeni exemplifies every single canard ever uttered by the antivaccination movement. "It's a conspiracy by the pharmaceutical industry." "Science always changes so you can believe what you like." "It's a debate and a controversy." "Measles was never that bad anyway." "Immune systems are damaged by being understimulated." "Immune systems are damaged by being overstimulated." And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clip has been taken down from Goldacre's site while the lawyers frolic, but this is the internet: &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Bad_Science:_Jeni_Barnett_MMR_and_vaccination_slot_on_LBC_radio%2C_2009"&gt;it's still available elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend that more of us download a copy and keep it handy. Barnett is only going to succeed in disseminating her own indictment ever further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even better: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/02/jeni_barnett_mmr_show_-_full_t.php"&gt;Science Punk and a network of bloggers&lt;/a&gt; have partial clips and transcripts of the silly show.

There seems to be a lot of unclear calls to action online due to some severe cuts in the package, so I want to try to make this more clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First– the Republicans are saying this is a spending bill, not a stimulus package. That’s basically yet another conservative load of baloney: the spending is going toward stimulating the economy. The bill has short-term and long-term goals in it, so that we can get things rolling quickly, yet be able to sustain the events once the initial push is over. A stimulus needs inertia, or else it grinds to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Democrats are working with moderate Republicans to compromise (from what I have read and seen about this current package, the conservative Republicans don’t appear willing to compromise, only to cut) — though the bill passed the House with not a single Republican voting for it; I wonder if Obama understands what that means to future packages he proposes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One compromise &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090206/ap_on_go_co/congress_stimulus"&gt;that was reported by the AP&lt;/a&gt; — Talking Points Memo &lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/Collins-Nelson-Cuts/?resultpage=1&amp;amp;"&gt;has the specifics&lt;/a&gt; — is an $88 billion dollar cut to the original package. These are substantial slashes to the budget, including $750M from NASA (a 50% reduction), $427M from NOAA (a 34% cut), $100M from the Department of Energy office of science (a 100% cut), and $1.4B from NSF, again, a 100% reduction. In other words, DOE science and the NSF are being zeroed out of this bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear: these are not actually cuts to the budgets of these groups! The original package calls for &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; spending on them, so what these cuts mean is that the agencies won’t get as much of an increase, or, in the case of the DOE OS and NSF, any increase at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst case scenario is that these programs get cut, and nothing really has changed; they still get the same money they did before this package was proposed. The problem is that with the economy the way it is, we do need to do something to make sure our country continues running. The money that goes to NASA, for example, is to &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/index.html"&gt;the Exploration directorate&lt;/a&gt;, which includes going to the Moon and living in space. The money spent by Congress on these programs is &lt;em&gt;invested&lt;/em&gt;, not wasted. And studies show that money spent on NASA is returned multiplied several times. In other words, &lt;em&gt;we make money on NASA&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the National Science Foundation sponsors a huge amount of basic scientific research across the board, from students up to full-time researchers. Investing that money is directly investing in the future of the United States. I wonder about the cognitive dissonance necessary to rail against foreign countries outpacing us, yet trying to cut science funding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: increased spending in these programs is a good thing. It helps people keep their jobs, it produces things we need, and in the long run makes money for the country. &lt;a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm"&gt;I’m calling my senators right now&lt;/a&gt;.

A Tale of Caution and Optimism for Parents and Teachers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
with Maryanne Wolf, EdD &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto High School&amp;#39;s Historic Haymarket Theater &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 Embarcadero Road, Road, Palo Alto, CA 94301 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;corner of Embarcadero Road and El Camino in Palo Alto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
9:00 am to 12:00 noon
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The story of how the brain learned to read can teach us new ways to think about how every young child learns to read, why some children cannot learn to read easily but may grow up to be artists and inventors, and what some of the challenges are to the development of reading in a digital age. This is a program for parents, educators, and the community.

The History of the Reading Brain:
Implications for Reading Development, Teaching, and Understanding Dyslexia &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palo Alto High School&amp;#39;s Historic Haymarket Theater &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 Embarcadero Road, Road, Palo Alto, CA 94301 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;corner of Embarcadero Road and El Camino in Palo Alto &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3:30 to 5:30 pm
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The history and science of how the brain learned to read has significant implications for how we understand children&amp;#39;s development of written language, particularly their achievement of fluent comprehension. This history also provides a new conceptualization of reading failure and how to teach children with developmental reading issues. Finally, this history forces us to confront the challenges and opportunities of a reading brain that is changing in a digital environment.

There is no hint given that these are marginal characters with no connection to modern science, who are following an ideological agenda with the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/the_true_history_of_the_wedge.php"&gt;admitted goal of replacing science and secular government with a Christian "spiritual" rule&lt;/a&gt;. There are no rebuttals. I'm sure the DI was thrilled to use Forbes as an arm of their propaganda machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t possibly go through all of it; practically every sentence these guys write is misdirection, error, or outright lie. I&amp;#39;ll just try to give you a taste — a nasty, bitter taste, vile and rancid, but apparently the flavor Forbes wants to attach to their magazine — and you can decide whether you want to dig deeper into the cesspit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/05/evolution-evidence-religion-opinions-darwin09_0205_jonathan_wells.html"&gt;Jonathan Wells&lt;/a&gt;, one of the more contemptible charlatans behind the Intelligent Design movement. Here's one snippet of his sleight of hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 1859 science meant (and still means, for most people) testing hypotheses by comparing them with the evidence. For Darwin and his followers, however, "science" is the search for natural explanations. Such explanations should be plausible--that is, they cannot blatantly contradict the facts--but instead of being based on evidence they are based on the assumption that everything can be explained materialistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what he did there? He implies that Darwin was doing something that his peers of that time should not have recognized as science, because science is based on &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot; and not on &amp;quot;materialism&amp;quot;…and if you read further in his load of tripe, you&amp;#39;ll discover that he claims that &amp;quot;Darwinism&amp;quot; has no evidence, and that ID does, and will therefore win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to redefining the meaning of science, the intelligent design creationists apparently want to redefine evidence, too. Somehow, the fact that science demands material evidence — evidence that can by measured, repeated, analyzed, and integrated into theory — is a rule that means the kind of evidence that the DI wants to present is invalid. Which is true. We aren&amp;#39;t going to accept immaterial, supernatural claims as evidence, no matter how much Jonathan Wells whines that his Moonie fantasies ought to constitute legitimate support for his anti-science crusade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/06/neurosurgeon-intelligent-design-opinions-darwin09_0205_michael_egnor.html"&gt;Michael Egnor&lt;/a&gt; has to ramble vacuously in there. He's a neurosurgeon, you know. It's always the first thing he types. But then he makes the same empty claim as Wells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is unassailable. The most reasonable scientific explanation for functional biological complexity--the genetic code and the intricate nanotechnology inside living cells--is that they were designed by intelligent agency. There is no scientific evidence that unintelligent processes can create substantial new biological structures and function. There is no unintelligent process known to science that can generate codes and machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What evidence?&lt;/i&gt; All they do is wave their hands at the wonderful complexity that real scientists have discovered — which nobody denies — and repeat their mantra that natural processes can&amp;#39;t generate complexity, therefore God. But we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that natural, unguided processes are remarkably good at building elaborate innovations, and that chance can produce surprising novelties … and that natural selection acts to prune back the exuberance of random variation to a functional diversity. Their syllogism is false. One example: look at the &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/apr04.html"&gt;nylonase enzyme&lt;/a&gt;, produced by a frameshift error. That's a natural process, not design, and it produced new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/05/racism-eugenics-economics-opinions-darwin09_0205_john_west.html"&gt;John West&lt;/a&gt; repeats his bogus argument that Darwin was to blame for 20th century racism and mass murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin waffled about following these ideas to their logical conclusion, but his followers were not so squeamish. The Darwinian rationale for eugenics was embraced by leading biologists at Harvard, Princeton and Columbia, as well as by leading European scientists, giving the movement the clear backing of the scientific community for decades and providing for justification of the forced sterilization of more than 60,000 people in the United States and the killing of more than 200,000 disabled persons in Nazi Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwin did not "waffle". He understood the sense of what people like Galton were proposing, that by protecting against selection by smallpox, for instance, we are allowing people with susceptibility to the disease to propagate, which would result in populations having a greater weakness to disease. That does not mean that he endorsed shutting down modern medicine, or any of the other institutions which support the poor or infirm. He had his own ideas about better ways to promote the common good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more efficient causes of progress seem to consist of a good education during youth whilst the brain is impressible, and of a high standard of excellence, inculcated by the ablest and best men, embodied in the laws, customs, and traditions of the nation, and enforced by public opinion. It should, however, be borne in mind, that the enforcement of public opinion depends on our appreciation of the approbation and disapprobation of others; and this appreciation is founded on our sympathy, which it can hardly be doubted was originally developed through Natural Selection as one of the most important elements on the social instincts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also true that some few in the scientific community did endorse eugenics, and even that some scientists helped the Nazis. But it is a complete lie on the part of West that there was a &amp;quot;clear backing of the scientific community&amp;quot;: there were many vocal dissenters from the eugenics program, and eugenics as a whole was less the product of scientific consensus than a façade for the endemic racism of the population as a whole. Martin Luther was pushing his crude version of eugenics in the 16th century, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another clown in this show is &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/05/alfred-russel-wallace-intelligent-design-opinions-darwin09_0205_michael_flannery.html"&gt;Michael Flannery&lt;/a&gt;, someone I've never heard of before, who has apparently written a biography of Alfred Russel Wallace that I don't think I need to read, if this is the quality of his history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, Darwin's own theory could hardly be called objectively scientific. Early influences on Darwin's youth established his predisposition to materialism and a dogmatic methodological naturalism long before his voyage on the Beagle. In short, Darwin's metaphysic compelled his science. Wallace, on the other hand, was a tireless investigator who increasingly discerned design in nature. Unlike Darwin, Wallace's science compelled his metaphysics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say what? Darwin, trained to be a theologian, admirer of Paley, was philosophically predisposed to dogmatic materialism? That is a bit of a stretch, don't you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think it&amp;#39;s part of the DI&amp;#39;s general strategy. Relying on real, physical evidence to make a case is to be declared anathema; True Scientists™ build their case on metaphysical imaginary supernatural &amp;quot;evidence&amp;quot;, like the creationist&amp;#39;s rationale for a god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think their new motto ought to be "Making Stuff Up for Jesus". It's all they've got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now why Forbes would willingly act as a mouthpiece for these shills is the real mystery — &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#39;ve written for Forbes before, and they usually seem sensible. But since they are implicitly endorsing the DI&amp;#39;s approach to evidence, I guess I actually don&amp;#39;t need to find out — I can just invent an explanation and it&amp;#39;s as good as any other. Therefore, I think somebody snuck into the editorial staff&amp;#39;s homes late at night and carried out involuntary lobotomies on everyone. And if you try to disagree with me, obviously you are an ideologue with an a priori commitment to the metaphysic of materialism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/for_shame_forbes_magazine.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/BZsa-F1CK14" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233940385116"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/cutting_science_already.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e67098d0d0f4162c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Cutting science already?</title><published>2009-02-06T16:38:33Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T16:38:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/-51wWNwU7sI/cutting_science_already.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/02/cutting_science_already.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/02/science-gets-th.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;: wherever Obama has proposed stimulus spending for science, conservative senators propose chopping back massively.

Their staff have identified several “useless” programs included in the bill, and it appears that they consider science funding to be one of those useless pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last 50 years, much of our economic development has been driven by science, and at a time when the US is faced with losing its scientific dominance to China and the EU, the US needs increased science funding.  Give a man a fish, he eats for a day.  Teach him how to fish, and he will eat for a lifetime.   Fund fishing research, and your children all eat for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the list of &lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/Collins-Nelson-Cuts/" rel="external "&gt;stimulus projects that are on the cutting block&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSF&lt;/strong&gt; 100% cut ($1,402,000,000)&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NASA exploration&lt;/strong&gt; 50% cut ($750,000,000)&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOAA&lt;/strong&gt; 34.94% cut ($427,000,000)&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NIST&lt;/strong&gt; 37.91% cut ($218,000,000)&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOE energy efficiency &amp;amp; renewable energy&lt;/strong&gt; 38% cut ($1,000,000,000)&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOE office of science&lt;/strong&gt;  100% cut ($100,000,000)&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this blog takes no opinion on a stimulus package, most of its readers probably do.  If you have an opinion about these cuts or the stimulus in general, you should make it known to your &lt;a href="http://senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm" rel="external "&gt;Senators&lt;/a&gt; because they will soon be voting on this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

Darwin’s day is just around the corner (February 12th is the 200th anniversary of his birth and this year is the 150th anniversary of the publication of Origin of the Species), and so it’s a good time for a creationist smack down. As usual Egnor gets everything wrong. He clearly does not understand evolutionary theory, or simply does not care if his straw men are accurate or not as long as he gets to regurgitate the standard anti-evolution propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his article he makes a number of wrong or misleading statements, some in question form. He substitues assertion for evidence, and fallacies for logic. His objections to evolution begin with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fossil record shows sharp discontinuity between species, not the gradual transitions that Darwinism inherently predicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong.  First, I must point out that Egnor insists on referring to evolutionary theory as “Darwinism.” As many others have pointed out before, this is a propaganda tactic to attempt to diminish evolutionary theory to the quaint ideas of one guy. It is also misleading, for the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory differs in significant ways from strict Darwinian theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pertinent to this specific example. Darwin himself thought that the fossil record would show gradual continual change among species. What we found, rather, was relative stability punctuated by speciation events - species would remain mostly stable for about 2 million years on average, then disappear from the fossil record. Meanwhile, new species would appear. Gould and Eldridge termed this pattern punctuated equilirium, and creationists have dutifly ignored them ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor is also wrong on many levels. First, while species are generally stable, they do drift over their time on earth. Sometimes they even show gradual directed change. Also, you have to consider the overall pattern of the fossil record, not just zoom in myopically to the regions of stability. The fossil record shows a pattern of new species arising which are clearly related to and derived from older species. There is a clear pattern of branching descent in the fossil record - to the degree that it is complete. The fossil record is highly spotty, but the more we fill it in the more it fits the pattern of branching descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, as predicted by evolutionary theory, some fossil species we find fill in gaps between extant species.  The gaps have been steadily shrinking since Darwin’s time. How far do the gaps have to shrink before Egnor would think there was not “sharp discontinuity?” He can decide to demand arbitrarily small gaps that will never be filled - such are the tactics of deniers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And further still modern biology of extant species puts the lie to Egnors false assertion. Species are not sharply discontinuous. Species are actually very fuzzy entities, with many sub-populations and local varieties, and even apparently different species can often exchange DNA. Species are only truly discontinuous when they can no longer interbreed and produce fertile young - something which is demanded by evolution and genetics, not contradictory of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin’s theory offers no coherent, evidence-based explanation for the evolution of even a single molecular pathway from primordial components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong. Here Egnor is just flaunting his own ignorance of the theory he rejects.  He is trying to echo the claims of Behe and irreducible complexity. And yet, biologists have fleshed out much of the molecular pathways that Behe himself used as examples, such as the clotting cascade and the bacterial flagellum. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/01/02/smoke-and-mirrors-whales-and-lampreys-a-guest-post-by-ken-miller/"&gt;Read these posts &lt;/a&gt;by Ken Miller who destroys Casey Luskin from the DiscoTute on this very issue. Here is also a &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB200_1.html"&gt;brief discussion of the bacterial flagellum&lt;/a&gt;. What Egnor fails to realize is that being personally ignorant of something does not mean it doesn’t exist (a phenomenon formally known as being “egnorant” - and yes, I know I’m the 1 millionth blogger to hit upon that happy pun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The egnorance continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origin of the genetic code belies random causation. All codes with which we have experience arise from intelligent agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong.  Intelligent Designer proponents  have been abusing information theory for over a decade now - another discipline that they do not make sufficient efforts to understand. The genetic code is not random - it the the product of very non-random selection. That is the whole point of evolution - incremental increases in information can be retained by selection, and therefore information and complexity can slowly increase over evolutionary time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor is also committing a logical fallacy - his statement is a non sequitur. His unstated major premise is that no system can be unique or without precedence. Well, life is the most complex thing in nature. It stands to reason that it will display properties of complexity that do not have examples outside of life. Yet, Egnor treats his statement as if it proves the genetic code could not have evolved. It’s absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is evidence for variation, selection, gene duplication, redundancy, vestigial genes, and homology - all the pieces are in place. Further, the pattern of variation that we see in the genetic code of life is so overwhelmingly consistent with common descent that there is simply no other plausible explanation - short of just saying that God or ID miracled it into existence and maliciously made the genetic code look exactly as if it evolved. (&lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section4.html"&gt;Here is a good overview&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intricate biomolecules such as enzymes are so functionally complex that it’s difficult to see how they could arise by random mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah - the argument from personal incredulity.  Egnor would limit science to his own feeble and biased imagination. Further, this is a false premise - they did not arise by random mutation. They arose by varation from mutations and recombination combined with natural selection. You need to keep the selection bit in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not difficult for me to imagine it at all - I guess I remember more of my biochemistry from med school than Egnor. Organic reactions can take place without enzymes - just slowly. Enzymes, which are proteins that catalyze organic reactions, make these reactions go faster. But they do not have to be “perfect” or necessarily complex to have some activity. A protein that makes a reaction go a little faster by chance could still provide a selective advantage. Over millions of years, variation and selection can slowly modify the protein so that it is a better and better enzyme. This is actually an excellent system for gradual change over time. This change may also be punctuated by mutations that happen to provide a significant advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would further add that gene duplication allows for redundant enzymes, so that one is free to drift in random directions while the other copy continues its original function. This allows for tremendous molecular evolutionary experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor has more questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why, when the genetic code was unraveled, didn’t scientists question Darwin’s assumption of randomness? Why didn’t Darwinists ask the difficult questions that are posed for their theory by the astonishing complexity of intracellular molecular machinery? Why do Darwinists claim that intelligent design is untestable, and simultaneously claim that it is wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong and wrong. Scientists did question Darwin’s assumptions when genetics were discovered.  Mutations seemed decidedly not gradual. Natural selection was questioned also. Its just that over the first 30-40 years of the 20th century these questions were carefully worked out - the difficult questions were asked and answered, and some continue to be. The result was the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory. Egnor and his cronies just didn’t like the answers to which the evidence lead the scientific community. Sore losers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Egnor keeps referring to randomness. But evolution is not random in that natural selection is the non-random survival of individuals who have some advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, scientists do not state that ID is wrong. We state that it is not even wrong - it is simply not asking a teastable scientific question. &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=269"&gt;I discuss in detail here&lt;/a&gt; why ID is not science. This distinction is perhaps too subtle for Egnor. To further demonstrate his lack of understanding, he continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do Darwinists claim that intelligent design theory isn’t scientific, when both intelligent design and Darwinism are merely the affirmative and negative answers to the same scientific question: Is there evidence for teleology in biology?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because asking a question is not sufficient to be considered a science. I can ask, “Does God exist?” That does not make it a scientific question.  You have to be able to say - if ID exists in biology, then what would we expect to find in nature? ID proponents refuse to make such predictive statements. Rather, they try to get away with saying what we will not find in nature (that’s the whole point of irreducible complexity), namely an evolutionary explanation for every jot and tittle of life, down to the last protein. But the failure to find evidence for a competing explanation does not render your theory scientific or testable. What ID proponents want is to set up a goal-post for evolution so that they can forever nudge it back, and then invoke a false dichotomy to declare ID the winner by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concatenation of logical fallacies is not science. Egnor needs to answer this - what would ID look like in nature, stated in an operational and testable format. This cannot just be - “well, duh, it sure looks designed to me.”   The scientific community is still waiting. Give us something testable that could prove ID wrong. Evolution has survived many such challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Egnor has mastered the Gish Gallop by which he can generate misconceptions in far fewer keystrokes than it would take me to correct (even with linking to other extensive posts for backup).  So I will finish with just one more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do Darwinists–&lt;em&gt;scientists&lt;/em&gt;–seek recourse in federal courts to silence criticism of their theory in public schools? What is it about the Darwinian understanding of biological origins that is so fragile that it will not withstand scrutiny by schoolchildren?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is pathetic that the IDers are trying to goad us this way. Why don’t they just point at scientists and say, “chicken” while making clucking noises. Maybe that will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science of evolution is rock solid. It has withstood tough scientific challenge - the scrutiny that counts.  The issue is not about wanting to shield a theory from criticism or close examination, but the quality of science education. ID is simply not science. It is chock full of misinformation and logical fallacies. It makes a good example of pseudoscience at an appropriately advanced level of study - college, say. But it is not appropriate for highschool science classrooms, and is never appropriate to be presented as if it were legitimate science. The fact that we don’t teach astrology in science classroom does not mean that we feel modern astronomy is fragile. Nor does the plate tectonic theory have anything to fear from the hollow-earthers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor’s recycled creationist arguments have all been demolished many times over in the past, and we will have to do it again in the future. The argument doesn’t change because Egnor and his ilk are not interested in genuine intellectual discourse. Rather they are just trying to provide cover for believers - for those who wish to impose their personal religious beliefs onto science education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JB: Amanda, talk to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda: Hello! Um, I’ve got eight children,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB: Mazel-tov! Are you still sane?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda: No! Anyway, and I started off, young, about twenty - did all the things you were supposed to do and presented my daughter and she had all her vaccinations and my second daughter had all her vaccinations. Then my son was born and he reacted very badly to the first, and what I think then was the double or triple jab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um, so he then didn’t have any more, although he did then have the MMR, well, he did have some more, but he didn’t have any more Whooping Cough. He then had the MMR, um… and then when he was three he was diagnosed with autism. And so I got quite involved in vaccines, because I wasn’t sure, um, my paediatrician was quite sure that it was the cause of the autism, but I mean, I didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from then on, I decided not to have my children vaccinated – I just thought ‘better be on the safe side’ – I mean, my paediatrician thought it was great, my GPs weren’t; they were always very unhappy that I didn’t have them vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;
TIMESTAMP: 1.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB: Why, why though, that the GPs won’t take on what the paediatrician did??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda: I don’t know! I mean, my paediatrician is great, she’s a very holistic paediatrician – she was the of big chief consultants at a hospital down on the south coast, so she’s a very good paediatrician, but she very much believed in … in just sort of holistically looking after the child. Um, she didn’t like giving drugs for things if you didn’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB: But you know, people do throw ‘guilt things’, at you, don’t they? They must say to you ‘all right, for you, Amanda’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda: Um…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB: How do you cope with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda: Well, yeah, they probably do, um, … the main thing I found is that my eldest who has everything, she actually had a really bad case of Whooping Cough, about two years ago. And we did get quite a lot of things thrown at us then but she was the one who had been vaccinated. None of my other children picked it up.&lt;br&gt;
TIMESTAMP: 2.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB: Now what would you say – I mean, it’s not my job to say to people ‘don’t do it’, it’s not my job to do any of that. But you’re allowed to have your say. What would you say to people as a mum of eight little lives that you’re deeply responsible for? What would you say to people who are in two minds about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda: Um. Well, I would never recommend having children vaccinated, and people think I’m very strange. But all my younger children who have never been vaccinated have been very, very healthy. Um, the youngest had measles, um, now three months ago. And he was fine, he wasn’t very well for about a week, ten days – and then he was fine, and none of my others picked it up. So, I think they must have a certain amount of natural immunity – and I’m far, far happier for them to have developed that ‘natural immunity’ – than to be constantly filled with artificial substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JB: Well, thank you so much, my darling, that was Amanda in Hayword’s Heath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was just listening to your show, if people took the time to look at what’s in vaccines, they would think twice about giving them to their children. As well as not being a hundred percent effective, they also have cancer-causing agents.&lt;br&gt;
Timestamp: 3.00&lt;br&gt;
“Also a child’s immune system takes approximately two to three months to fully get up and running from birth. Also, if we look at the countries that have the highest population vaccinated, you will notice that they have the most allergies. I’m not totally against immunisations, but we should be giving children at least a year to develop their own immune system to deal with the onslaught.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t say that – I wish you’d given me your name? There’s a third way, says somebody else who’s nameless: “Why don’t we allow children to have the jabs individually?” Why not? It’s half-past two!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;END 3.35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[STATION IDENTIFICATION – ADVERT FOR HER NEXT GUEST]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RESTARTS 4.00&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just got one or two announcements, and there are many of you who want to talk about this measles thing – I get so impassioned about it, because I think it’s about freedom – and I think that self responsibility for your body and children and health is top of the list! You know, early to bed, early to rise, makes you HEALTHY, wealthy and wise! The four-square of life: health, wealth, love, and perfect surface expression!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do you go from there? About being healthy – and YOU have to make a decision, don’t you, on behalf of your children! It’s the WORST decision you’ll have to make – should you / shouldn’t you! It’s alright when you’re making it for yourself – but I want you to tell me, why you think we have to have this measles jab and why I’ve got several things I’m going to read out in a minute, why you think it’s not necessary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’ll be talking to a doctor in a moment, and somebody who is pro-jabs, I just have to make two announcements…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is actually a pretty wealthy hunting ground for humor. The Big Bang Theory is still slaying me when I watch it, and sometimes they put in jokes you kinda have to be a scientist or a geek to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Malow not only agrees with me (I assume) but he’s taken it a step farther: &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecomedian.com/"&gt;he’s a science-based stand-up comedian&lt;/a&gt;.

Quoting a legendary fact-checker there, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each word in the piece that has even a shred of fact clinging to it is scrutinized, and, if passed, given the checker's imprimatur, which consists of a tiny pencil tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is revealed later on to be a metaphor and/or a record-keeping device; I think all involved know that literally checking at the word-level would be mostly pretty vacuous, and would miss a lot of assertions. My favorite non-word-level anecdote in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn&amp;#39;s daughter Margaret fished in the Delaware, and wrote home to a brother asking him to &amp;quot;buy for me a four joynted, strong fishing Rod and Real with strong good Lines …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was not with the rod or the real but with William Penn&amp;#39;s offspring. Should there be commas around Margaret or no commas around Margaret? The presence of absence of commas would, in effect, say whether Penn had one daughter or more than one. The commas—there or missing there—were not just commas; they were facts, neither more nor less factual than the kegs of Bud or the colors of Santa&amp;#39;s suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more or less perfect for anyone who has ever published a book on commas (not in an Eats-Shoots-and-Leaves way, but rather with the goal of using them as a window into certain intonational and semantic effects). The issue is whether &lt;em&gt;Margaret&lt;/em&gt; functions as a restrictive modifier of &lt;em&gt;Penn's daughter&lt;/em&gt;. If it does, then the way is paved for Penn to have more than one daughter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) Penn's daughter Margaret is taller than his daughter Betsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Margaret&lt;/em&gt; is merely appositional, then we'd do well to wrap it in commas, and then (1) becomes strange (indicated with #), because the first occurrence of &lt;em&gt;Penn's daughter&lt;/em&gt;, lacking additional restrictive modifiers, presupposes that Penn has only one daughter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) #Penn's daughter, Margaret, is taller than his daughter, Betsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McPhee has it right with the slight &amp;quot;in effect&amp;quot; hedge: failing to include the commas would not &lt;em&gt;assert&lt;/em&gt; that Penn has more than one daughter, it would just suggest this pragmatically. We tend to expect that each restrictive modifier we encounter will do some work, usually by removing some objects from consideration and focusing us on others. Thus, &amp;quot;Penn&amp;#39;s daughter Margaret&amp;quot; creates the expectation that Penn has at least one non-Margaret daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &amp;quot;kegs of Bud&amp;quot; in the above brings us back to an earlier anecdote. That one also turns on the distinction between misleading claims and false ones. In a submitted manuscript, McPhee had simply guessed that a certain Budweiser factory produced 13,000 kegs a day, knowing that the fact-checkers would get the right number. The right number turned out to be 18,000. Again, I think McPhee&amp;#39;s claim would not have been false, just misleading (and not only because it was &lt;a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html"&gt;bullshit&lt;/a&gt;). At the start of a semester of pragmatics, I often tell my students that I will try, later in the course, to convince them that it is true, albeit misleading, to say that I have seven fingers and four toes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Potts</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233930942872"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_593.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f12118b5e280bf74</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-02-06T13:27:19Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T13:27:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/C-2kt4k2mPo/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_593.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_593.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_593.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize that I've been neglecting my woo. Indeed, yesterday I noticed that it's been a month and a half since I did a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/your_friday_dose_of_woo_when_a_mad_mathe.php"&gt;real Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that particular installation of my long-running blog series (over two and a half years!) was some incredibly powerful woo. In fact, it was titanic, mind-bogglingly amazing woo. We're talking Lionel Mllgrom-grade woo. Actually, we're talking Lionel Milgrom himself, a level of sheer looniness that few, if any, can match, much less surpass. Once you've experienced the sheer power of his quantum homeopathic madness, it's hard not to become a bit jaded. My woo circuits were stimulated to overload; any other woo seems, well...ordinary and even logical by comparison. It's just that hard to compete. Milgrom's also a hard act to follow. He is a black hole of woo beyond whose event horizon no science, reason, or mathematics can exist undistorted, and seemingly Milgrom draws all woo to himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all the best woo necessarily has to involve fancy-schmancy equations that abuse quantum mechanics to the point where Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Werner Heisenberg, among others, are busily doing back flips in their graves at the pain of seeing their science turned into imaginative and magical woo. Sometimes, the simplest-sounding woo is the best woo. No grand excursions into multiple dimensions and quantum entanglement this week, just some good old-fashioned mind over matter--and not just any mind over matter exercise, but mind over the matter that makes up one's own body. But what mind over matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, if I could control the matter that is my body other than in the standard, boring, visible way of having my central nervous system fire off nerve impulses that make my muscles move, I know I'd probably like to bulk up my muscles a bit and perhaps get rid of a bit of fat. Oh, wait. There already is a way of doing that for someone like me, who's put on about 10 pounds over the last year and is a bit out of shape. It's called diet and exercise. But that involves work! Some people will risk surgery to get rid of that fat, and some people will risk surgery to get a better-looking body. Wouldn't it be so much better if "mind over matter" could eliminate that choice? No more having to choose between either diet and exercise or plastic surgery, on the one hand, versus remaining unsatisfied with one's body on the other, none of which are appealing choices. I'm sure you can see the appeal of using the mind to fix the body this way. After all, haven't woo-meisters been telling us for years that the mind can fix the body?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, if you're a woman and unsatisfied with your endowment, why go through all the difficulties and potential risks from surgery if you can simply use &lt;a href="http://www.adam-eason.com/store/the-hypnotic-breast-enlargement-programme/"&gt;Adam Eason's Hypnotic Breast Enlargement System&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_best_woo_is.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_best_woo_is.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/J-v49K5wmgw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1233920975788"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_196.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f126f7c8d50f1ba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-02-06T08:56:10Z</published><updated>2009-02-06T08:56:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/mojtOxXCBLg/clock_quotes_196.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/clock_quotes_196.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not at all uncommon for someone to arrive at a scene of brutality or injustice and, with a sympathetic murmur or heroic flourish, attack the victim.

&lt;p&gt;You may not be aware that Ben has taken the audio off his site due to legal threats relating to copyright. As Ben points out below, being this is such a controversial topic (and seriously, except for people like Jeni Barnett and “Andy Wakefield” it needn’t be) isn’t it important to debate the issues, openly and publicly? This is not so easy to do without access to the original audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never fear however, bloggers of the world united today, including &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/rachiesyd"&gt;myself&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/"&gt;Lay Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/Bad_Science:_Jeni_Barnett_MMR_and_vaccination_slot_on_LBC_radio%2C_2009"&gt;WikiLeaks &lt;/a&gt;where you can find the mp3, linked to a dozen or so servers across the world. Also just added is a &lt;a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/194639999/Bad_Science_Bingo__with_Jeni_Barnett.mp3.torrent.html"&gt;torrent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Ben had to say. Unlike Ms Barnett (or ANNE COULTER - see below), he is polite, succinct and informed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel very strongly that patients should be free to decline medical treatment if they wish. Ideally if it was a serious medical problem, and you felt able to listen, a doctor would have made a good attempt to explain what is known about the risks and benefits of each option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am however concerned – along with a great many others - that your recent hour-long campaigning broadcast against the MMR vaccine was thoughtless, misleading, ill-informed, and irresponsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it’s enormously inappropriate, I’m afraid, that you describe a polite and informed nurse as “vicious” on your website, in your previous blog post, simply because she called into your show and disagreed with you. She does not have your wealth, she is not a TV or radio presenter, she does not have your platform, and she does not have your legal team. She was clearly not “vicious”, as anybody listening to the audio would be able to tell for themselves. I believe you owe this listener an apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all I think it’s regrettable that your company, LBC and Global Audio, have now used legal threats to make me take down the audio excerpt in question, so that it can no longer freely be heard. I have spent a great deal of my time, both writing, and in other activities, in supporting free and open access for the public to medical and scientific information and literature. Yours was a broadcast on the public airwaves, and a review of it, and discussion about it, was important and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really felt that access to information was important, and that debates were worth having, I think you would encourage your legal team to reconsider, and simply give permission for this clip to be made freely available, in the public domain, in full, as it was broadcast, so that it can be widely heard, understood, and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;br&gt;
www.badscience.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just for amusement value, see if you can spot whether the following diatribe comes from a supporter or critic of Jeni. Let’s see; misuse of the caps lock key, check; incorrect use of punctuation, check; lack of spaces after full stops, check; lack of paragraphs, check; an inability to spell, check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a rant on her LBC radio show, she spat misinformation and conspiracy theories about the safety of MMR and vaccination. In addition to shouting over the top of nurses and GPs who had called in to politely correct her. But like Jenny McCarthy she has a “Mommy” instinct, so she obviously knows best. No-one can compete with that, least of all science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt; was sent a clip of her rant, he did the responsible thing and posted it to his &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; so that millions of people could hear the irrational, ill-informed, potentially damaging opinions for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And believe me, you will not believe how bad this is until you hear it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response from LBC was to threaten Ben with legal action for a breach of copyright. This threat has backfired in a major way for LBC. By threatening to slap Ben with a lawsuit unless he remove the offending material (which he subsequently has), they have effectively started a huge &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"&gt;Streisand effect&lt;/a&gt; which is currently resonating across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“To all of you Bad scientists, who are SO angry with me, good luck with your research. Should you fall ill I will attend you as best I can with my motherly love. Should I fall ill, as a non paid up member of your club, will you administer to me? And should I refuse your drugs then what?” Jeni Barnett&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mp3 appeared on &lt;a href="http://WikiLeaks.org/wiki/Bad_Science:_Jeni_Barnett_MMR_and_vaccination_slot_on_LBC_radio%2C_2009"&gt;Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt; sometime this morning with 13 servers hosting it from all over the world. People have already begun blogging it, with links to the Wiki page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend Res posted the entire 40 minutes (the excerpt originally on Ben’s blog) on my &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dRnkmw-_L4"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Several people have commented that transcribing the segment is the best way to get around the legal red tape. Time will tell if this is the case, however…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/rachiesyd"&gt;Click here to hear the 40 min rant on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…I hardly think it matters anymore, following pleas for help on his blog and &lt;a href="http://Twitter.com/bengoldacre"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Ben has mobilised an army and this thing has gone viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a example of Jeni’s complete lack of scientific understanding she said this gem during her show; &lt;em&gt;“Have you had the flu jab? But still you’ve got the cold?”. &lt;/em&gt;The influenza virus is not the same virus that causes colds. FAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well done LBC for making what could have been an embarrassing stuff-up which may have resulted in a few cranky posts on Jeni’s blog into a world wide scandal. (Interestingly, someone calling themselves &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield"&gt;Andy Wakefield &lt;/a&gt;from Thoughtful House posted a message on Jeni’s blog offering assistance. Well, I guess he would know!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Ben for bringing this to our attention. Thank you Res for posting this to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

The study specifically discusses how a presynaptic Fragile X granule is expressed in the developing brain; as the authors note in the &lt;a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/5/1514"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that Fragile X proteins play a distinct, presynaptic role during discrete developmental epochs in defined circuits of the mammalian CNS [central nervous system]. We propose that the neurological defects in Fragile X syndrome, including the autistic features, could be due in part to the loss of FMRP function in presynaptic compartments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Justin Fallon, professor of neuroscience at Brown University says that "'The implication is that pre-synaptic defects could contribute to the pathology in autism in Fragile X.'" A 2007 &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/autisms-cause-at-the-synapse/"&gt;Science article&lt;/a&gt; indeed suggested that autism's cause may "reside in abnormalities at the synapse." Some &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090204174304.htm"&gt;media sources&lt;/a&gt; are referring to &lt;a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/5/1514"&gt;this study&lt;/a&gt; as potentially leading to a "new autism treatment" in the form of drug treatments, although it's only in about of 2% to 6% of children diagnosed with autism that the Fragile X gene mutation is the cause, according to the &lt;a href="http://www.nfxf.org/html/autism_and_fragile_x_syndrome.htm"&gt;National Fragile X Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son tested negative for Fragile X; the media ought to be clearer in noting that the Fragile X gene mutation accounts for a small percentage of autism cases. Research that looks at synaptic functioning  and autism has been of interest to me in and of itself. Reflecting not only on &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; my son struggles to learn---anything involving language, written and spoken---but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; he struggles----it often seems to require so much time and effort for him to process sensory stimuli---makes findings about synapses particularly of interest. There's things about Charlie (how he holds and moves his body; his need for deep pressure of a massage-like sort) that I started to first notice when I was expecting him: Charlie has always been Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more, he's some thorough combination of Jim and me, of what he inherited from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recently published study in the February 5th &lt;a href="http://www.cell.com/AJHG/home"&gt;American Journal of Human Genetics&lt;/a&gt; seeks to identify the &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-02/cp-sns012909.php"&gt;genes for synesthesia&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. &lt;a href="http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/j.asher/"&gt;Julian E. Asher&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/about/divisions/medicine/genomic_medicine/"&gt;Department of Genomic Medicine&lt;/a&gt; at Imperial College London is the lead researcher; from a &lt;a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-02/cp-sns012909.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team identified four candidate regions linked with susceptibility to synaesthesia but no support was found for an earlier theory of linkage to the X-chromosome. Although the resolution of the scan makes identifying candidate genes challenging, the researchers identified a number of interesting genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The region on chromosome 2 with the strongest linkage is particularly interesting as it has been previously linked to autism," offers Dr. Asher. "Sensory and perceptual abnormalities are common in autism spectrum conditions and synaesthesia is sometimes reported as a symptom." Candidate genes associated with epilepsy, dyslexia, learning and memory are also located in the candidate regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings indicate that the genetic basis of auditory-visual synaesthesia is more complex than originally believed and may be due to a combination of multiple genes subject to multiple modes of inheritance. "This study comprises a significant step towards identifying the genetic substrates underlying synaesthesia, with important implications for our understanding of the role of genes in human cognition and perception," concludes Dr. Asher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A combination of multiple genes subject to multiple modes of inheritance": There's not some "autism gene" that (in an oversimplified understanding of genes) is passed on from parent to child. A suggestion for a &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/a-unified-theory-of-autism/"&gt;unified genetic theory of autism&lt;/a&gt; considers the role of spontaneous mutations in causing autism; such de novo mutations may account for up to 30 percent of cases of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit back I wrote about there being &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_autism_in_all_of_us"&gt;a little autism in all of us&lt;/a&gt;. There's a clear combining of Jim and me in Charlie, who looks exactly like me, with the same tall, lanky frame as his dad. Also &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/like-father-like-son/"&gt;like his dad&lt;/a&gt;, Charlie loves to be in motion (trains and cars and walking and running and biking) and has bouts of hyperness and lulls of quietude. Like me, he can have incredibly obsessive &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; accompanied by a &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/an-idea-of-order/"&gt;need for order&lt;/a&gt;, and then there's that  &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_autism_in_all_of_us"&gt;synesthesia&lt;/a&gt; business. However Charlie came to be, the resemblances are uncanny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly 20 senators from both parties met twice during the day and reviewed a list of possible cuts totaling 88 billion. They included elimination of at least $40 billion in aid to the states, which have budget crises of their own, as well as $1.4 billion ticketed for the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geesh!  We’re talking more than $800B of stimulus and the very first thing on the chopping block is basic science.   That demonstrates just how low basic science is regarded.  It looks like education is also being cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have anything intelligent to say about this situation.  I don’t think there is anything intelligent to say about this situation.  They just don’t get it.  It’s been &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11463"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; time and again that advances in basic science stimulate the ecomony. If you’ve ever thought about contacting your senators, the time is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: &lt;/em&gt;The senate reached a compromise last night and due to everyone’s efforts,  funding for basic science was mostly restored!  The Senate stimulus bill gives  NSF $1.2B in additional funding,  $330M for DOE Office of Science ($100M for supercomputing was cut), $1B for NOAA, $475M for NIST,  $1.3B for NASA, and $2.6B for DOE energy efficiency and renewables.  We’ll see what comes out of the House/Senate conference, but this is a good start.  Sometimes democracy works.&lt;/p&gt;
