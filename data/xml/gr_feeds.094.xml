The book makes interesting arguments, some of which I agree with, and some of which I don't.  More important, however, is that the authors have a track record of being listened to (cf &lt;i&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/i&gt;).  In a crisis that involves communication (i.e. of scientific knowledge), it would be foolish to ignore people who have proved themselves in that realm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M &amp;amp; K make a convincing argument that scientific information is not being communicated effectively to &amp;quot;real people&amp;quot;.  I will stipulate that scientific knowledge is at least as important now as it has ever been, and that there is a gap in understanding between scientists and the lay public. For their thesis to have any utility, this must be true.  Whether this gap is unique to our culture and our time is less clear to me, but the basic problem remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that there is a, "need for scientists to communicate their knowledge in ways that non-scientists can relate to and understand."  I also agree to an extent that, "scientists [often] fail to connect with top decision makers" (which intersects with, but is different from, the lay public).  Where they lose me, but only a little, is with the assertion that we must, "break down the walls that have for too long separated the "experts" from everybody else."  For better or for worse, we need experts, and some barriers are insurmountable.  Not everyone (including me) can understand how to design a microprocessor.  I must in some way &lt;i&gt;trust&lt;/i&gt; those that do.  Those that investigate and design our world must be trustworthy in the eyes of the rest of us, and to the extent that this is the "wall" they are writing about, I'm with them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In medicine, this idea of "expert-ness" is critical.  It is a constant frustration for some lay folks and others that medicine requires special knowledge, and quacks capitalize on this by sounding "expert-y".  But doctors--and scientists--have special knowledge, special skills, and special creativity not possessed by all the rest of us, and to pretend that it isn't so is dangerous.  Still, we could put some portholes in that wall, dig some tunnels, create effective communication.  But I'll always have to trust the astronomers if they tell me object "x" is made of neutrons or whatnot, because I'll never have the skills to see for myself.&lt;br&gt;

Consider the following: &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. If one is adequately informed of the consequences of a decision, and willfully choosing to make that decision is clearly irrational, then it is irrational to willfully choose to make it. &lt;br&gt;2. If one willfully chooses to make an irrational decision, then one's moral or reasoning faculties are defective. &lt;br&gt;3. If one's moral or reasoning faculties are defective, then this defect was either the result of (a) choices that the agent herself made in the past or (b) external causes. &lt;br&gt;4. If one's moral or reasoning faculties are defective due to external causes, then it cannot be one's fault that one's reasoning faculties are defective.&lt;br&gt;5. If one's moral or reasoning faculties are defective due to choices that the agent herself has made in the past, then it cannot be one's fault that her reasoning faculties are defective.&lt;br&gt;6. If it cannot be one's fault that one's moral or reasoning faculties are defective, then it cannot be one's fault for willfully making an irrational decision. &lt;br&gt;7. Nonbelievers are adequately informed of the consequences of rejecting God, and willfully choosing to make that decision is clearly irrational. [&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;assumed only for the sake of argument&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;br&gt;------------------------&lt;br&gt;8. Therefore, nonbelievers who willfully choose to reject God are irrational in choosing to make this decision.  (from 6, 1)&lt;br&gt;9. Therefore, those nonbelievers' moral or reasoning faculties are defective. (from 7, 2)&lt;br&gt;10. Therefore, it cannot be the nonbelievers' fault that their moral or reasoning faculties are defective. (from 8, 5, 4, and 3)&lt;br&gt;11. Therefore, it cannot be the nonbelievers' fault for willfully choosing to reject God. (from 10, 8, and 6)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some would question (5). Some, I suspect, are inclined to think that if one's moral or reasoning faculties are defective due to choices that the agent herself has made in the past, then it &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;can&lt;/span&gt; be her fault that her moral or reasoning faculties are defective. Not so: we first have to inquire why the agent made the choices she did. Were they rational choices or irrational choices? Was she aware of the fact that her past choices would result in her moral or reasoning faculties becoming defective? If she was aware of this consequence, then her past choices could not have been rational -- hence they were irrational. But if willfully choosing to make those choices was irrational, then her moral or reasoning faculties were &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;already&lt;/span&gt; defective. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At some point, after we have inquired into why the agent made the choices she did, we arrive at an external explanation. We thus arrive at conclusion (4): that if one's moral or reasoning faculties are defective due to external causes, then it cannot be one's fault that one's reasoning faculties are defective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-1124284503795270014?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure lots of people can say many things about him, but to me he was the heart of the Apollo missions. The classic moment in his lengthy career was when he was stunned speechless when the Lunar Module touched down on the Moon, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNUMq9Sq8mc"&gt;and had to literally take a moment to take off his glasses and compose himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was all of us, watching that moment. I hope he lived long enough to see the images of the Apollo sites returned by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was too young to remember his Apollo coverage, though I’ve seen it many times on TV, but I did have one tangential encounter with him. In 2002 I got an email from Cronkite’s assistant at CBS. She told me that he had recently been in Japan and was &amp;quot;taken off guard&amp;quot; when people asked him if the landings had been faked. He hadn’t heard the Apollo deniers’ conspiracy theory! She wanted to get a copy of the awful Fox TV show about it. I had a copy, given to me by another journalist as part of a press kit. I gladly sent it to her along with a copy of my first book, which has a chapter in it debunking the hoax nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, a young girl wrote to Cronkite about the hoax, telling him her teacher at school was teaching kids the landings were faked. His assistant forwarded her letter to me, so that I could reply as well. Cronkite’s assistant also told me that he was delighted that she had directed the young girl to my website! So I guess that means he had read what I wrote, and that makes me very proud indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cronkite had a gift for making the news relevant to everyone, and he made that profound moment in 1969 more human.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247885403387"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1585">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d2fc39b567960993</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Errors"/><category term="Language and the media"/><title type="html">Walter Leland Mr. Cronkite</title><published>2009-07-18T02:32:04Z</published><updated>2009-07-18T02:32:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1585" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When a big news story is breaking, like the passing of Walter Cronkite, it's not surprising that reporters and editors might be a little hasty in getting the word out. &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/theword/2009/07/walter_leland_mr_cronkite_rip.html"&gt;Jan Freeman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; spotted a search-and-replace error in the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-090717-cronkite-obit-first-story,0,4649985,full.story"&gt;online obituary&lt;/a&gt; for Cronkite, where all instances of &amp;quot;Cronkite&amp;quot; got replaced by &amp;quot;Mr. Cronkite.&amp;quot; Here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of the uncorrected version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/mrcronkite.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;float:none" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/~bgzimmer/mrcronkite.jpg" alt="" width="450"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/theword/2009/07/walter_leland_mr_cronkite_rip.html"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could get used to this form of address; after all, it's no weirder than "Richard, Cardinal Cushing" or "George Gordon, Lord Byron." But I think a daughter might prefer the feminine form: "Kathy, Ms. Cronkite." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan initially called this a &lt;a href="http://blog.oup.com/2007/11/spellchecker/"&gt;Cupertino error&lt;/a&gt;, but since there is no spellchecker to blame, I would classify it as a more general search-and-replace error, based on an inaccurately applied style policy. In this case, the style policy is that recently deceased males get called "Mr." by the &lt;em&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I discussed in the post &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/005361.html"&gt;Incorrections in the newsroom: Cupertino and beyond&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;quot; the classic example of this is the old canard about a newspaper replacing &amp;quot;back in the black&amp;quot; with  &amp;quot;back in the African American.&amp;quot; Turns out this story originated as a practical joke by a prankster at the &lt;i&gt;Fresno Bee&lt;/i&gt; in 1990, but in that post I provide a couple of real examples of search-and-replace errors  — including the fascinating Reuters report that revealed, &amp;quot;Queen Elizabeth has 10 times the lifespan of workers and lays up to 2,000 eggs a day.&amp;quot; (Blame that on a search-and-replace of &amp;quot;the queen&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Queen Elizabeth.&amp;quot;) And more recently, a conservative Christian news site managed to change the name of sprinter Tyson Gay to &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=294"&gt;Tyson Homosexual&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper was a result of a "communal" experiment in the lab, i.e., it was not included in anyone's Thesis.  My advisor designed it and started the experiment with the first couple of birds.  When I joined the lab, I did the experiment in an additional number of animals.  When Chris joined the lab, he took over the project and did the rest of the lab work, including bringing in the idea for an additional experiment that was included, and some of the analysis.  We all talked about it in our lab meetings for a long time.  In the end, the boss did most of the analysis and all of the writing, so the order of authors faithfully reflects the relative contributions to the work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is not mentioned in the post below is an additional observation - that return of the food after the fasting period induced a phase-shift of the circadian system, so we also generated a Phase-Response Curve, suggesting that food-entrainable pacemaker in quail is, unlike in mammals, not separate from the light-entrainable system.&lt;/p&gt;

And I've just added to the list one entitled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060560053?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0060560053"&gt;The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0060560053" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, I know, everyone else on the planet has already read this and knows about it and since the book was published a very very long time ago (late 2008?) it does not deserve to be discussed in the blogosphere.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it is relevant as news because of the connection between various&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20090717/pl_politico/25073"&gt; nefarious players who have done recent stupid stuff &lt;/a&gt;and the organization outlined in the book.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm especially looking foward to the author's discussion of the 18th century preacher Johathan Edwards, which I understand to be absolutely scandalous and novel.  Maybe too novel.  Maybe not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, though many of you have already read this book and have much more to say about it than I do, so please ... do so.  &lt;/p&gt;

Some people will tell you that it’s all about neurogenesis. &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/aug2003/nimh-07.htm"&gt;The theory goes&lt;/a&gt; that antidepressants increase the rate at which new neurones are created in a region called the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and that, somehow, this boom in the number of new hippocampal cells alleviates depression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To date, however, all of the research linking antidepressants and neurogenesis has involved animals. It was generally assumed that if drugs altered neurogenesis in mice, the same thing happened in humans – but this was an assumption, and clearly a pretty big one. Now a new report from a New York-based team claims that antidepressants do enhance neurogenesis in people - &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/npp200975a.html"&gt;Antidepressants increase neural progenitor cells in the human hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors took post-mortem brain samples from three groups of people – those with no history of depression, those with depression who were not on antidepressants when they died, and depressed people who &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;were &lt;/span&gt;on antidepressants. They counted the number of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the hippocampus using a stain which specifically marks these cells (anti-nestin).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although like all post-mortem studies the sample size was small (n=19 total), depressed people taking antidepressants when they died had much higher NPC numbers, indicating greater neurogenesis, compared to the other two groups. (Control: 360±246; untreated: 1119±752; treated: &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;17229&lt;/span&gt;±3443).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SmDrCvwbl0I/AAAAAAAAAbc/BW-dKv_nk-8/s1600-h/hippocampus+depression.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:146px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zE8CzamN1Y0/SmDrCvwbl0I/AAAAAAAAAbc/BW-dKv_nk-8/s400/hippocampus+depression.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The picture above illustrates this; the brown cells are NPCs, and there are evidently more of them in the antidepressant-taking person on the right compared to the control on the left. The authors presumably picked these images because they look different, so, pinch of salt. But still, as an antidepressant user myself, it's nice to see what might well be going on inside my skull at this moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the area where neurogenesis happens, was also larger in the antidepressant-treated group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this evidence for the neurogenesis theory? Not exactly. It’s fairly good evidence that some antidepressants do boost hippocampal neurogenesis in humans, in accordance with the animal data. But we really don’t know what that means. It could just be a side effect, and nothing to do with how they work. I’ve &lt;a href="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/04/depression-neurogenesis-and-herpes.html"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/01/prozac-and-old-mice.html"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2008/11/prozac-made-my-cells-spiky.html"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; some recent animal experiments finding that antidepressants have effects on behaviour even when neurogenesis is completely blocked. And notably, five of the seven antidepressant-treated patients in this study died from suicide. So, to put it bluntly, the drugs didn’t work very well, despite sending neurogenesis through the roof...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Neuropsychopharmacology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1038%2Fnpp.2009.75&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Antidepressants+increase+neural+progenitor+cells+in+the+human+hippocampus&amp;amp;rft.issn=0893-133X&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fdoifinder%2F10.1038%2Fnpp.2009.75&amp;amp;rft.au=Boldrini%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Underwood%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hen%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Rosoklija%2C+G.&amp;amp;rft.au=Dwork%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=John+Mann%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Arango%2C+V.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CPsychology%2CNeuroscience"&gt;Boldrini, M., Underwood, M., Hen, R., Rosoklija, G., Dwork, A., John Mann, J., &amp;amp; Arango, V.

In fact, I’ve never been. Not that I didn’t want to attend, but I’ve recently made it a rule to only attend conferences where I have been invited to speak. Makes it much easier on my pocketbook, and I don’t end up regretting my decisions to not attend any of the bazillion conferences I could attend each year. But, why do I bring this up… the conference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conferences are a brilliant way to bring people together in order to foster communication. Certainly, if you are attending a conference, you are most likely interested in the topics to be covered. But, there is always the session that you didn’t expect to be interesting that turns out to be thought-provoking. Not to mention the mixers where you most certainly bump into people of all types, and have conversations you could never expect. The environment (or, it might be the alcohol) pushes people out of their shells, making them more social than normal, more interested than normal, and allowing maximum information transfer to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can the conference vibe be transferred elsewhere? How can we get people out of their mental caves and interested in communication… or, even learning, dare I say it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;First, the environment needs to have ease of entry. People need to find what they are interested in easily. The minute search takes too long, people lose patience and move on to something else. The internet is a great place to foster mass communication and information transfer, and social and new media are getting to a point that the barrier to entry into any conversation topic is incredibly low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the content needs to be engaging. Just like college lectures, the less interesting a video, blog, or slide-show are, the less people connect to the material. People judge novel content just like they judge people… subconsciously. Whether they are aware of it or not, they have decided their level of interest within 2 seconds. If the approach to getting information across is not able to make a good first impression, the opportunity for engagement is already lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third and finally, the environment needs to allow free exchange of ideas and responses. This is crucial to the basic idea of communication as communication can never be one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social web is getting closer and closer to putting all of these pieces together, and I am constantly on the lookout for interesting projects that are on the verge of making science communication better. In my recent web jaunts I came across the Imagine Science Film Festival, which will take place in New York in October. I think this festival is starting in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival is organized by &lt;a title="Imagine Science Films" href="http://www.imaginesciencefilms.com/"&gt;Imagine Science Films&lt;/a&gt; and sponsored by &lt;a title="AAAS" href="http://www.aaas.org"&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt; and Science Magazine. But, rather than just getting film-makers to submit films and holding a physical festival, the organizers have partnered with the well-known video sharing site, &lt;a title="Vimeo - Imagine Science Fim Festival" href="http://vimeo.com/groups/imaginesciencefilms"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, they have enabled the submission process to become a social one. People can upload and comment on each others videos. And, the hope is that the films run the gamut from artistic to educational to fun. This brings together film-makers from all different backgrounds into one conversation about what science in film actually is or even what it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Vimeo is featuring a different video each week from the group of submissions, which has the effect of bringing people from outside the circle of science enthusiasts or interested film-makers into the conversation. The barrier to entry is low due to Vimeo’s involvement. Add to this the fact that the content is video, which can be quite engaging if done well. And, the forum allows for the exchange of ideas through the video format and comment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, this has all the pieces to enable the successful fostering of communication about science in a much broader forum than that offered by a conference setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you’d like to submit a video, the contest entry ends July 31. So, get on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kirsten Sanford</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247872235115"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-4137575776131022296">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/15462cdd8dce791a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="christianity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Don't Waste Your Cancer!</title><published>2009-07-17T19:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T19:44:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/dont-waste-your-cancer.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/TasteAndSee/ByDate/2006/1776_Dont_Waste_Your_Cancer/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; little gem while poking around at old posts over at &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/2009/06/05/three-religious-holidays-for-the-price-of-one/"&gt;Your Religion Is False&lt;/a&gt;.  A few choice selections from their list about ways in which people "waste" their cancer:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will waste your cancer if you do not believe it is designed for you by God.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will waste your cancer if you believe it is a curse and not a gift.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will waste your cancer if you seek comfort from your odds rather than from God.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will waste your cancer if you think that “beating” cancer means staying alive rather than cherishing Christ.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will waste your cancer if you fail to use it as a means of witness to the truth and glory of Christ.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Wow.  Now, mixed in with that shockingly offensive bullshit are a couple of good pieces of advice (e.g. "You will waste your cancer if you let it drive you into solitude instead of deepen your relationships with manifest affection" -- it's a little fucked up to use this whole &lt;i&gt;you will waste your cancer&lt;/i&gt; phraseology, but certainly the basic point is a valid one).  So I don't want to say that people don't probably find solace from stuff like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I have to say, comments like "You will waste your cancer if you think that 'beating' cancer means staying alive" are goddamned insulting.  &lt;i&gt;Cancer is not a gift&lt;/i&gt;, okay?  And if it is, I'm never ever ever &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; inviting Jesus to another one of my birthday parties, unless he promises not to bring a present.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-4137575776131022296?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247872235115"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-5864235060925181974">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f81e62d3cd0f551b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">"Everybody must like the same things I do, or else they are a pathetic bitter individual!"</title><published>2009-07-17T16:16:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T16:16:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/everybody-must-like-same-things-i-do-or.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">I read a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/very_off_topic_why_i_wont_be_a.php"&gt;post over at ScienceBlogs today&lt;/a&gt; by this math guy who works at Google talking about why he won't be going to his high school reunion.  In short, he had no friends in his graduating class (all of his friends were one or two years younger or older than him) and had probably about the worst high school experience I've ever heard of, including a dude breaking his finger for fun, and another asshole using gasoline to paint a swastika in the street in front of his house and lighting it on fire.  WTF?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah, seems pretty straightforward that he wouldn't want to go to his high school reunion, right?  Even if the criminal bullying hadn't occurred, why would you want to hang out with people you were &lt;i&gt;never friends with in the first place&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except if you read the comments, there are a whole bunch of douchebags saying that guy must be "bitter" and that he needs to learn to "forgive".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excuse me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Look, forgiveness is a good thing, but if you forgive someone who wronged you that doesn't mean they are now automatically your friend, especially if they were never your friend to begin with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't have nearly as bad a time in high school as this guy, but it's not a time I remember fondly and I really have no desire to go to any of my reunions.  Why would I?  It's not a time in my life that I wish to celebrate or revisit.  That just happens to be my personal choice.  I understand that other people had a great time in high school, and that's fine, they &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; celebrate it!  But not everybody has to like everything.  And if somebody happens to hate something that you are fond of, you need to learn to deal with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, I wouldn't miss the &lt;a href="http://www.custombrewcrafters.com/fest07/autumnFest07.html"&gt;Autumn Festival of Ales&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://www.custombrewcrafters.com"&gt;Custom Brewcrafters&lt;/a&gt; holds out in Honeoye Falls.  It's always a great time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let's say some other blogger is a recovering alcoholic or maybe they just hate the taste of beer.  And they happen to write a blog post about how they won't be going to the Festival of Ales.  Would I show up in their comment section and accuse them of being bitter?  Say that, for their own good, they had to find a way to forgive beer for tasting so bad to them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, that would be retarded.  And so are the people showing up on MarkCC's blog and saying the same things about him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-5864235060925181974?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247872235114"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-9077758767453561100">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/25539ed7f9465044</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="cooking" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Pizzas everywhere!</title><published>2009-07-17T14:53:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T14:53:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/pizzas-everywhere.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">Mariah's 30th birthday party was last Saturday.  It was a great time!  We had a keg, first time I've ever done that, our patented "booze piñata"&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and six pizzas.  We didn't have time to make our own dough, so we cheaped out and used Boboli crusts.  Oh, and it was just storebought marinara sauce.  But we got all kinds of compliments on them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;My favorite was a six- or seven-pepper pizza (I lost count!) that Mariah dreamed up.  Bell peppers, jalapeños, Thai chile peppers, Hungarian peppers, serrano peppers, Fresno peppers, and I think one other type that I didn't recognize.  I thought it would be way too spicy, and while it was definitely "hot", it was not at all inedible.  Awesome!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We did two pizzas with fig, prosciutto, goat cheese, and blue cheese.  This is one of Mariah's favorite flavor combinations:  fig combined with bacon or prosciutto, with a strong-flavored cheese.  It's just amazing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another popular one was spinach, white mushrooms, portabella mushrooms, and onions.  We tried a classic Margherita pizza (garlic and olive oil base with sliced tomatoes, fresh mozzerella, and fresh basil) with the added twist of using heirloom tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes.  It was tasty, but I think I sliced the tomatoes too thick and they released a lot of water which prevented the crust from cooking up.  If I do a Margherita pizza again, I'll probably precook the tomatoes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had one leftover crust and a bunch of leftover mushrooms, bell peppers, and prosciutto, so I just through that all together for the last one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All in all, it was a great, very tasty meal, it fed probably 20 people, and it was pretty cheap all things considered.  The biggest expense was the crusts, and if we made our own we could have virtually eliminated that.  We will definitely be doing pizza night again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yeah, "booze piñata."  This is the third time we've done it.  We fill a pinata with the usual candy and confetti and such, but also put in a couple dozen airplane bottles of liquor.  It always takes the party to another level after that...&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;Oh, and sorry there are no pictures.  I was too depressed about Stash to really think about that.  I think I was a bit of a downer at the party, but hopefully not too awful...&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-9077758767453561100?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247872235114"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-1909513601075975349">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/81925c32e1245b46</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="colbert" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="christianity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Yet another tragic wrist injury</title><published>2009-07-17T14:39:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T14:39:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/yet-another-tragic-wrist-injury.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8155372.stm"&gt;Pope suffered a broken wrist&lt;/a&gt; last night while in his chalet in northern Italy.

Believe it or not, I have made it to thirty without having to really deal with death at all.  My paternal grandparents were dead before I was born.  My maternal grandmother passed away when I was just a bit too young for it to have the full effect -- I was old enough to know what death meant, but not old enough that I can now recall much about how it felt... I remember a few snapshots, particularly my mother coming in the door having return from the hospital and croaking out, "She died," and that as soon as she said it I felt my ears burning.. but very little else is concrete.  And my maternal grandfather faded so slowly, the grief of his actual death was mild. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've had a handful of acquaintances who I later found out had died, but nobody I knew really at the time of their death.  The exception is Mariah's aunt Vicki, who died last year of terminal cancer... but the first time I met her was the day she was diagnosed, so in a way I was prepared for her death from the start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I guess that's why I'm being such a big baby about Stash dying.  She's just a cat, sure, but it is the first time I have had to fully deal with the unexpected death of someone/something I loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is also another component, though, that makes this difficult, and that is what I referred to in the title to this post.  I am someone who prides myself on "knowing a little bit about a whole lot of stuff."  Heh, I guess that's why I was big into working on Wikipedia for a while... and I still just randomly surf around, absorbing a breadth of information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, I have a few morbid fascinations with things like air disasters, engineering disasters in general, the mechanisms of disease, etc.  To generalize, it's an interest in science-meets-death I guess.  I don't know exactly why... maybe I'll explore that in another post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, the point I am making is that I have all this abstract knowledge of horror, but no concrete knowledge of horror, having had as I mentioned previously a remarkably tragedy-free life so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holding Stash as she died... feeling for the first time what it felt like to hold a warm and still barely living body that nonetheless was like dead weight, like a warm furry sack of organs more than a being...  experiencing directly for the first time the slowed pulse rate and cold body temperature of a mammal in shock... seeing her lose control of her bowels and of her swallow reflex, shitting and drooling, suddenly focusing my abstract knowledge of the indignities of death into something real and concrete...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, it was just a cat, but I feel as though every terrible thing that I understood in the abstract is now firmly in the realm of the possible.  No, strike that, I think even before I was able to perceive the terrible as a possibility, but now, irrationally, all the abstract horror seems not just possible but &lt;i&gt;inevitable&lt;/i&gt; -- which, in a sense, it surely is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To put this another way... what is so jolting about the suddenness of Stash's death is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; that it seemed surreal.  On the contrary, it felt at the time to be almost &lt;i&gt;hyper-real&lt;/i&gt;.  It was life in high-def.  It was everything you knew was there all along, but now you could actually &lt;i&gt;see it&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think I am quickly coming to terms with the particular emotions of the loss of Stash.  But even as the pain of losing a pet fades, I'm experiencing a profound lack of hope for the future.  In any given proposition, the worst possible outcome now seems all too real, almost &lt;i&gt;likely&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sure I'll get over that soon too, but right now it's a little fucked up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-5223010869564657671?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247872235113"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-5140813489857381517">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/91975c41251ddaaf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="death" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">One of the Lucky Ones</title><published>2009-07-11T02:31:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T02:31:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/one-of-lucky-ones.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/FQAPmA0vnlE%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the hardest things about Stash dying was how sudden and mysterious it was.  I think about that she was eight years old, not that old for a cat, she could have easily lived twice that long.  It's hard to keep it in perspective and remember to appreciate the years she had, when I can quite reasonably say that she could have had just as many all over again, if "whatever" poisoned her hadn't come along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But yes, let's have some perspective.  Eight years or sixteen years, it's not even a blink in the history of life on Earth.  Uncountable trillions of possible cats were never even born, and yet I was astronomically lucky to be able to spend just a little time with this one astronomically lucky cat.  One blink of an eye or two, the important thing is that she lived at all, and that she was with a family who loved her, and that I got to know her.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-5140813489857381517?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247872235113"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1973938108988281018.post-3051629483068341217">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e57b71e075363a0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">She's Gone.</title><published>2009-07-09T04:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T04:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/2009/07/shes-gone.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1973938108988281018-3051629483068341217?l=nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (James Sweet)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">No Jesus, No Peas</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247871685907"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/some_giant_see-through_george.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9bf65b91d29bbc43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">“some giant see-through George Lucas”</title><published>2009-07-17T23:39:42Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T23:39:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/azlTgaqQ5do/some_giant_see-through_george.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/some_giant_see-through_george.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I laughed. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqC73omSk4o"&gt;I laughed loudly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I've got to start using you more. Here are some people who have been asking for it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nojesusnopeas.blogspot.com/"&gt;No Jesus, no peas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://apileofblog.com/"&gt;A Pile of Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/"&gt;Mors Dei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/"&gt;The Pile System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/"&gt;Why Evolution is True&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fly, my pretties, fly! Invade their blogs and leave comments and jack up their traffic and…and…stuff. That will teach them! Yarrrr!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have another army arising, too. Remember, the &lt;a href="http://www.secularstudents.org/conference/creationmuseum"&gt;SSA and I are going to the Creation "Museum"&lt;/a&gt; on 7 August. It's going to be huge: last I heard, we've got 70 people signed up to descend on the place. I hope we have enough horses and lances to go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s got me thinking, though. With that many people, we want to stand out a little bit, and be able to recognize each other, so I have a request: all you godless heathens at the &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; should wear an armband. Any color will do, and in fact a diversity of colors would be best to represent the diversity of our views, anyway — just tie a handkerchief or something around one arm when you go. Let everyone know what side you are on and what you represent: maybe a few of the other attendees will ask you who all those people with the armbands are, and you can politely explain to them what&amp;#39;s going on, and encourage them to ask us questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also tell them that all the people with armbands are laughing at them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/the_gloves_are_off.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/L72Gz0P-tgY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247871666233"><id gr:original-id="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/?p=88">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/178f9d80780ff780</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Republicans"/><category term="dumbass"/><category term="Joe the Plumber"/><category term="Meghan McCain"/><title type="html">People Who Don’t Piss Me Off</title><published>2009-07-16T18:59:23Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T18:59:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/people-who-dont-piss-me-off/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meghan McCain seems alright.  She had a &lt;a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/228068/may-18-2009/meghan-mccain"&gt;pretty decent showing&lt;/a&gt; on the Colbert Report a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She makes my blog today though for this rather blunt statement of the obvious in an interview with Out Magazine. (&lt;a href="http://www.out.com/detail.asp?page=2&amp;amp;id=25589"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Joe the Plumber — you can quote me — is a dumbass. He should stick to plumbing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s actually doing a decent job trying to raise the profile of the non-wingnut segment of the republican party.  For my part, I hope she succeeds.  The country would be better off with fewer wingnuts, even if that means strengthening the republican party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.  If anyone wants to help me figure out how to embed videos from The Daily Show/Colbert Report without them looking like this, please leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/harry-potter-out-tomorrow/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/wclDW5nAaBc/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me, you want something to get yourself hyped up.  If you’re going to do just one thing, I suggest re-watching the fourth movie.  Although I think the fifth movie as a whole was better, I think the fourth movie gives the more dramatic setup.  The jarring contrast between the (mostly) harmless competition of the tri-wizard tournament and the sudden re-emergence of Voldemort at full power is the most exciting part of the series up until this point.  The scene where Harry brings Cedric’s body back from the graveyard is also the most powerful scene from any of the Harry Potter movies in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the fourth movie, as the title of the last chapter of the fourth book suggests, sets you up for the beginning of the war, which is right where the sixth book and movie start.  I’m a big fan of the whole series and I very much liked the fifth book and movie, but I think that all the stealthy ways of Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the fifth book are a bit slow paced.  If you want excitement, go straight from Voldemort’s reemergence to his wreaking havoc in the sixth movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you all enjoy seeing this one, the sixth book was by far my favorite and I hope the movie lives up to that standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 5 major themes running through the New Testament that I find repulsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Blood Sacrifice as a way to appease God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Throughout the Old Testament, God requires blood sacrifices of goats and other animals and maybe the occasional child.  In the New Testament, God decides that these are not enough to get people into heaven properly, so he creates a son of his own just so that he can sacrifice him to himself.  Try to ignore the question of how much of a sacrifice it is if God is both making it and being appeased by it, the idea of sacrificing a person to appease a god is repulsive.  The god that requires killing people or animals as a way of getting rid of sin is a repulsive god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Being able to relieve others of their sin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;The other premise of the whole Jesus story, is that Jesus is somehow able to take other peoples’ sin upon himself.  Stop and think about whether you’re okay with that idea.  Lets say I had a son who was convicted of raping someone.  I don’t want my son to go to prison, so I say to the Judge, “Sir, I will take my son’s sin upon myself, and serve his punishment in his stead.”  I am then sent to jail instead of my son the rapist.  Would you want this to be possible?  No, of course you wouldn’t.  The person who does the sinning should bear the consequences.  But in the New Testament, Jesus comes along and says that he can take everyone else’s sin upon himself.  This is not a kind of justice that I can condone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Belief in God/Jesus is a person’s &lt;em&gt;most important&lt;/em&gt; virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;For this, lets take a look at John 3:18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008800"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;It doesn’t matter how good a person you are, or why you don’t believe in Jesus, if you don’t believe in him you are automatically condemned.  Believe in Jesus though, and as long as you atone for your other sins you’re fine.  This has to be the most repugnant of the ideas in the New Testament.   More important than doing good works, caring for neighbors and loved ones, not hurting other people, not murdering them is belief that a specific god exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  Unquestioning faith as a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Faith, that is beliefs in something without evidence, is not a virtue.  You know what is a virtue, making sure you have a good reason to believe something.  Blind faith is the easy way out.  You don’t have to think, you don’t have to support your beliefs, hell, your beliefs don’t even have to make sense.  Tell me what about that is good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  Thought crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Other than the principal thought crime of not believing in Jesus, the New Testament confirms the Old Testament idea that coveting and lust are somehow criminal.  Matthew 5:28-29&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;That’s Jesus talking.  I am not okay with the idea of thoughts that enter your head being in any way a sin.  Acting on those thoughts are fine, but if I find a married woman attractive and don’t act on it, I’ve done nothing wrong, and I certainly deserve to keep my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not meant to be an exhaustive list.  Those are simply five moral lessons &lt;em&gt;central&lt;/em&gt; to the New Testament that I find repugnant.  Does Jesus make some good moral suggestions too?  Sure he does!  But if you were to take the New Testament, and remove all the passages that taught the above listed morals, you would no longer have the New Testament.  They aren’t separable.  Make the distinction between the vengefulness and cruelty taught in the Old Testament and the lessons taught in the New Testament all you want.  They aren’t any better.  Let me end this by quoting myself from a &lt;a href="http://thepilesystem.wordpress.com/the-problem-is-the-idea"&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the blurb about it I had hoped that it might be a history of the technology of flight, and the innovations that have been made along the way.  I really love learning about how things work, and what problems had to be solved to get them to work.  The museum has a really great section on the Wright brothers (total badasses) and the first flight that goes through all that stuff in detail and it was fascinating, and I was sort of hoping that this film would continue with that theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t.  I was in fact incredibly underwhelmed by it.  The film was basically just a bunch of aerial shots and shots of airplanes with a narrator who kept saying something to the effect of “Flying is extraordinary!”  So initially I was disappointed, until I realized what a privileged position I’m in.  Sure I’ve seen aerial shots in basically every movie and during every sporting event I’ve ever seen.  I don’t even notice that they’re anything special, I take them completely for granted.  But guess what, 100 years ago no one had ever seen an aerial shot (that’s not a fact checked statement but it’s approximately correct).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a moment near the beginning of the film where an actor is playing a man going up in a hot air balloon for the first time.  He yells down to the people below him how amazing it looks from up there.  Before balloons, no one had ever seen that kind of view before.  We all see aerial shots of every kind of geography all the time in film now, but before film and really before helicopters no one ever saw them.  Those first people to take flights had a view that really was like nothing they had ever seen, and I bet it was remarkable.  I felt bad for being underwhelmed by the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thought inevitably led me to think about what other things I take completely for granted that people 100 years ago had never seen before.  At almost 23 years of age, I’m old enough to appreciate the personal computer and certainly the internet as being incredible technological revolutions to me, but going back beyond that I tend to take everything for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this isn’t some especially new idea I’m having, this isn’t the first time I’ve explored this train of thought and I doubt it is for you either, but I think it’s worth doing.  The sense of wonder when I think about these inventions doesn’t ever diminish.  I’ll start you off with a slightly less-than-obvious one (at least to me who hasn’t lived outside a big city ever), the supermarket.  Go on and throw other interesting ideas out in the comments if you feel so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t know, some Jews interpret certain passages of the Bible (&lt;a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Exd&amp;amp;c=35&amp;amp;v=3&amp;amp;t=KJV#3"&gt;Exodus 35:3&lt;/a&gt;) as prohibiting the use of electricity (because it prohibits work, including kindling a fire, which is nothing like electricity but try telling them that).  They also include driving cars in that prohibition, and some angry Orthodox Jews were protesting a car park being open on Saturdays to accommodate tourists (many of whom are not Jewish).  Well, a journalist went to go cover the protest, but because she was using electricity (in the demonic form of a tape recorder), she ended up getting spat on by a whole bunch of these self-righteous protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the reporter’s own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found myself herded against a brick wall as they kept on spitting – on my face, my hair, my clothes, my arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was like rain, coming at me from all directions – hitting my recorder, my bag, my shoes, even my glasses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is disgusting behavior.  No one should be assaulted because they used a tape recorder on a Saturday.  I’m all for free speech, and if these people want to protest her using the tape recorder that’s one thing, but this mob crossed the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s something other than these protesters that’s crossed the line, the Bible.  The common sentiment about such issues is that these crazy religious people have taken their idea too far.  We should be upset with the people for &lt;em&gt;misinterpreting&lt;/em&gt; their religious beliefs, but the religion, or the particular doctrine in question is not at fault.  I think this sentiment is wrong.  Let’s look at Exodus 31:14&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, is the problem that this idea has been perverted to an illogical extreme, or is the problem with the very idea itself?  These people, in this case some Orthodox Jews, are guilty only of not letting their innate sense of human decency and morality override the ideas in the Bible.  Jews who don’t get upset by people breaking the Sabbath aren’t interpreting the scriptures differently (many probably haven’t read them very carefully), they are ignoring the scriptures when it conflicts with what they think is right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible, and particularly the Old Testament, is a terrible book.  Its sense of morality is revolting.  When we see people acting like these protesters acted, we shouldn’t be saying, “oh look how they’ve perverted their religion!”  We should saying, “Look at the inevitable results of telling people it’s okay to believe what the Bible says!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most “mainstream” religious people in this country, as well as a good proportion of the non-religious would disagree with me strongly here.  They would say, “Chris you are over-generalizing!  Look at me, I am a *insert religion* and I don’t do what they do.  You cannot say it is the fault of *insert same religion,* it is the people!”  This argument is wrong and missing the point.  It is right that you can’t say much of anything about “Christians” in general or “Jews” in general, because every individual Christian and every individual Jew has their own, unique system of beliefs.  I’m not saying that the problem is, in this case, “Judaism.”  I’m saying that the problem is the Old Testament.  It’ s a bad book, full of arbitrary and cruel rules with equally arbitrary and cruel punishments for not following them.  It’s also full of people doing incredibly cruel things but excusing it “in the name of God.”  Most “mainstream” Jews and Christians would admit that if they ever read it, but their religious beliefs aren’t really based on the actual text, or they ignore all the parts of the text that offend their own sense of decency.  But some people do actually believe some of these things that the Bible says, and that’s the very problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Orthodox Jews haven’t misused a good idea,  they’ve adopted a bad idea.  That bad idea is taking the Hebrew Bible seriously, and we should be saying that.  We should be attacking these passages in the Bible, and if that means also attacking the idea that the Bible is the inerrant word of God then we should be attacking that idea as well, because these actions are the logical consequence of those ideas, and only an innate sense of morality is stopping more people from acting like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, next time you see religious believers doing something that offends your sense of morality, don’t just criticize the believers, criticize the idea.  The idea is the problem.  The Bible is the problem, and we need to say so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of speculation about why Sarah Palin might have resigned, and whether this move helps her or hurts her in the 2012 presidential race.  Lets answer that second question right now.  It hurts her.  She quit her job without a clear reason, and people don’t want to elect a quitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question is only slightly more difficult to answer, but much of the news filler about her has been crap.  As I already said, this is not some brilliant strategy to help her in 2012 (because it won’t help, and because it very likely &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/07/sarah_palin_resigns.html"&gt;wasn’t endorsed by her strategists&lt;/a&gt;).  It is also &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-palin5-2009jul05,0,7018263.story"&gt;not because she’s under investigation&lt;/a&gt; as many would like to claim.  No, I think the answer is much less strategic than either of those, and it comes in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  She didn’t like governing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  She didn’t understand the consequences to her political career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Sarah Palin wasn’t really into politics so that she could govern.  She probably just wanted the power and attention (This probably applies to a lot of politicians).  Alaska Governor, however, no longer seemed so powerful after her Vice Presidential run, and being the front runner (along with Mitt Romney) for 2012 Republican Presidential nominee; and she didn’t really care for the job.  Hell, I don’t know that I would care for it.  So, she decided that she could still get attention (probably true) and still get power (maybe not true) without having to do all that work of actually being Governor.  She didn’t realize that it probably meant the end of her Presidential aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet she ends up on FOX News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my favorite part of the film was when the Sunflower star fish was crawling over some &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallop"&gt;scallops&lt;/a&gt;.  I had no idea that scallops could swim, but they do it by basically chomping their shell up and down really quickly.  It makes this great, chattery, clop-clop-clop sound.  They would also shriek right as they began to swim away (when they realized they were about to be eaten by a star fish), and I have no idea how they make that sound, or why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall of mammals was also &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;, although I didn’t get to spend as long there as I wanted to.  The first thing I want to point out is that the museum gets evolution absolutely right.  It avoids the common pitfall of talking about evolution as an intentional process, and says it like it is.  For instance, on the sign talking about how polar bears evolved from the American Brown bear (did you know that?  I didn’t!) instead of saying that the bears that got isolated up north adapted to the colder climate with white fur, and webbed feet, etc. it says that bears with lighter fur and more webbed feet prospered and many generations of cumulative change resulted in the modern polar bear!  It’s perfect, it doesn’t mislead people into thinking evolution is intentional, and it talks about cumulative, multi-generational change.  I’m so glad that, amidst all the anti-science idiocy in this country, our national museum gets things so right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned a few things!  I learned that all mammals, aside from having hair and producing milk, also share two of our ear bones, that evolved from jaw bones, that amplify sounding entering the ear.  I presume this gives mammals better hearing than most other animals, but I don’t know that.  Either way, Mammal Pride!  Also, walruses are friggin’ huge!  I also learned all sorts of other things that I’ve now forgotten.  Curse you, memory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to go back tomorrow and this time I’ll bring my camera so I don’t forget all the things I learn by the time I get home.  I don’t know if I’ll be able to upload any pictures though, I probably won’t try until I am reunited with my computer.  I know she misses me already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s all for now, but expect an update on my further museumery tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31925271/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/"&gt;Autistic girl arrested; family wants damages&lt;/a&gt; is the head line in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31925271/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/"&gt;MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Back in January, 8-year-old &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/handcuffed_at_school"&gt;Evelyn Towry&lt;/a&gt; was arrested at Kootenai Elementary School after staff said that she "spit on and inappropriately touched two instructors." She was handcuffed---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wait a moment. She is an 8-year-old girl.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there's more: Evelyn, who has Asperger's Syndrome, was taken to the county juvenile lockup and released to her parents. The charges against her were dropped by a county prosecutor. Now her parents, Charles and Spring Towry, wants the school district and county to pay more than $500,000 in damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scandalous and out of proportion, and yet that headline describes something that many of us, parents and self-advocates feel. Individuals and students with disabilities may not actually be, as Evelyn wrongly was, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_ed_in_the_us_restraints_the_police"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; (though it has happened to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/handcuffed_at_school"&gt;at least one other student on the spectrum&lt;/a&gt;). But they are daily subjected to discrimination and daily have their rights and dignity trampled upon in a multitude of ways (like the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/financial_abuse"&gt;financial abuse&lt;/a&gt; that Dora wrote about recently).&lt;/p&gt;

Collins was until recently the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, and I have no doubt that he will be a good administrator.  Nor do I think his religious views should have in any way affected his appointment; the people I would worry about are those who could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; compartmentalize religion from science as effectively as Collins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collins’s religious views may nevertheless be of some interest. The primary argument in his book &lt;em&gt;The Language of God&lt;/em&gt; is what he calls the Moral Law (his capitalization). In Collins’s view, morality could not have evolved; therefore God exists. Specifically, Collins argues that morality can be found only among humans. The moral code transcends culture, he says, and therefore must be inborn. He notes that humans are often altruistic, by which he means truly altruistic in the sense of never expecting return on their altruistic investment. He briefly notes the arguments of sociobiologists to the effect that altruism can provide indirect benefit to the altruist and uses infanticide among monkeys to demonstrate that monkeys are not altruistic. He observes that worker ants are altruistic (maybe that should have been in quotation marks) because they have the same genes as the queen but dismisses the possibility that altruism among humans could have a genetic basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Collins may be right, but telling us that monkeys commit infanticide and neglecting to tell us that humans also commit infanticide is cherry-picking data in the worst way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the case that &lt;a href="http://inside.mines.edu/~mmyoung/Morality.pdf" rel="external "&gt;altruism or morality could have evolved&lt;/a&gt; is strong, and Collins makes no serious effort to refute it. He goes on to tell us that the “Moral Law shone its bright white light into the recesses of [his] childish atheism” and concludes, with no logical or convincing argument, that his God must be a theist god as opposed to a deist god. Collins drew his conclusions, according to his own testimony, after having read &lt;em&gt;Mere Christianity&lt;/em&gt;, by C. S. Lewis, when he was 27. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent chapter, Collins describes the joy he got from discovering something not previously known, from discovering a little bit of truth. He longs, however, for a greater Truth and conflates the presumed existence of that Truth with “something much grander than ourselves.” He presents no real evidence for the existence of such a Truth, but at least he doesn’t like Freud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that Collins read a single book, was snowed, and converted from atheism to Christianity would be an exaggeration, but possibly not an outrageous exaggeration. Indeed, in his discussions of religion, he comes across as credulous, at best.  Happily, Richard B. Hoppe says, in a &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/11/noma-is-alive-a.html" rel=""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on a presentation in 2007, “According to Collins, naturalistic science can’t account for human Moral Law (Collins’ capitalization) or the origin of the universe and its (alleged) fine-tuning, and therefore belief in a God is at least partly justified. To his credit, Collins answered that he wasn’t claiming ‘proofs’ (his word) but rather only indications or pointers,” not dispositive evidence. Hoppe added privately that Collins had said that his faith would not be affected if it turned out that morality could be an evolved trait. Collins is evidently flexible in his thinking, and possibly he is reevaluating his position on the relation between morality and theism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a handful of references that help make the case for the existence of morality or altruism among nonhuman animals or for the evolution of morality.  Some of them appeared after Collins’s book. &lt;/p&gt;

As if that wasn’t quite fantastic enough she announced that I was the newest Skepchick at the coolest party at TAM7 to a packed house of skeptics of whom I completely respect and absolutely adore. Almost everyone at the party was wearing my jewelry WHILE they congratulated me on becoming a Skepchick. It was AWESOME. I was pretty convinced by the end that I had actually acquired Skepchick superpowers and I even considered signing up for Scientology’s super hero program to show them what super is really all about. It was an unforgettable weekend. I was on top of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I came home.  I had sold out of a lot of my pieces over the TAM7 weekend so I started posting some necklaces in my etsy shop and one of the pieces I posted was one of my atheist necklaces. I have posted a photo in case you are not familiar with the design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop.php?user_id=5240135&amp;amp;section_id=5265740"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Atheist-necklace-150x150.jpg" alt="Atheist necklace" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my pieces are hand formed and hand painted little pieces of ceramic art and I created that piece to fill a gap I feel exists. Let’s face it, atheists are sorely misrepresented in the jewelry market and this is one of my designs geared towards non-belief.  Very soon after I posted the necklace I saw that the counter on my Etsy page was steadily rising and for a moment I actually thought I had gained popularity due to my newly acquired Skepchick super-title. It was cool to be a skeptic and I was accepted as an atheist. I had reached my people. I had arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality was of course something completely different. The reason I was getting so many clicks was that my little piece of non-theist art was being &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3170454&amp;amp;userid=0&amp;amp;perpage=40&amp;amp;pagenumber=2"&gt;dragged through the mud&lt;/a&gt;.  On the “another I cannot believe anyone paid for this product thread” some guy with glowing angel wings on his avatar had posted a link to my necklace with a caption that said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“made with 100% [smug]“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below it someone posted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What are you talking about? Nothing makes you look cooler than a low-quality, homemade, ceramic necklace printed clearly with your stance on a controversial issue, but wittily as an acronym made up of more positive adjectives about yourself and those that agree with your position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well known that atheists are advertised by theists as evil, immoral, baby eating monsters. Now we were smug too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention with that design was to make a sweet necklace that could take the place of a cross or other theist pendant and I also wanted to express and reinforce some of the positive attributes of a nonbeliever that are so often distorted and dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it matter what a bunch of internet trolls with nothing better to do than complain about things think about the art that I create for atheists and skeptics? Am I preaching to the choir, as they say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really helped to put things in perspective for me. It reminded me thats it is important to to put skeptical and science inspired art out into the world.&lt;br&gt;
I’m proud of what I do and what I create as an artist. I’m also very proud to be an active part of the skeptical community. I realize now more than ever that we are a minority and that most people do not understand our (totally awesome) worldview. We have a lot of work left to do.  I will continue to create art that supports our movement. I will do my best to help explain skepticism and science to the public through visual mediums and I look forward to sharing my many projects with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m SO ready for my next mission.

Hey Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a question that deals more with a moral dilemma than an awkward social situation.  Due to the decent amount of atheist literature I have been reading recently, I would consider myself a relatively new “convert” to the faith (of course I still have to use quotes around convert, I have a ways to go).  Anyway, my question is this.  I tend not to believe in a higher power, but I do believe in some form of karma, maybe even destiny if you will.  To be perfectly cliché, I like to believe that “things happen for a reason,” that there might be an order to the universe (can an order be secular?), and that sometimes good things can even happen to good people.  These ideas deal more in the vein of positive events; I do not subscribe to inane drivel, religious or secular, that scapegoats minorities for natural disasters, the breakdown of family values, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So finally, are my notions of karma, with its seemingly implicit designings of a plan, in direct contradiction with my disbelief in a God?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scot
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Scot,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a moral dilemma, I think you are becoming uncomfortable  with some beliefs you hold that you sense are inconsistent and contradictory.  Your venturing into atheism is fairly new, and you’ve shared that you still “have a ways to go,” so it sounds like you still have some belief in supernatural agents or forces, but are unclear or unsure of them.  For many people, this period of being uneven and inconsistent is a protracted and often uncomfortable time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice below is only offered assuming that you want to get rid of the contradiction of  ideas in your mind.  Some people are perfectly fine with keeping their inner contradictions.  They may even know that their ideas are logically incompatible, but they prefer having their comforting beliefs over intellectual consistency.  Some will even acknowledge that they are believing something is true basically because it helps them to feel better.  I’d call it “argumentum ad euphoria.”  I tend to think that everybody has the right to whatever beliefs help get them down the road, and if those beliefs stop working, then they have the right to change them. (What they do to others is where I might object.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the descriptions I’ve heard of karma and similar things require some kind of supernatural agent to oversee it, basically a god, as well as a continuing soul to receive the karma, destiny, etc.  Other versions I’ve heard that do not require a god or a soul are so vague and amorphous that they do not seem to be very useful for explaining things or for consoling oneself.  The details of your particular concepts may make a difference in whether or not you can reconcile them with your disbelief in a god. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if your ideas about karma, destiny, things happening for a reason, and an order to the universe come from the same need that your belief in a god used to fulfill. The idea of living in a completely non-conscious universe that has no built-in system of fairness, that only follows patterns we call physical laws but not moral laws, that not only doesn’t care about us but also cannot even know that we exist, is a very scary thing to many people.  So when their belief in a parent-like god falls away, they may still be attracted to the comforting reassurance that there is some kind of order or justice to things, that we can have some kind of input, however small, to influence the things that happen to us, by virtue of our moral behavior.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself what is the main thing that is bringing you to no longer believe in a god.  If it is the lack of evidence, then your budding atheism comes from skepticism.  Skepticism is not the stubborn refusal to believe something, it is the need for convincing evidence in order to believe something.  You sound like you have that need.  Look at your ideas about karma and the rest, and look for credible evidence to support those ideas.  Be careful to not use arguments as if they themselves are evidence.  It’s easy to slip into circular thinking, where the premise and the conclusion of the argument are the same thing. Arguments are not evidence, they &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; evidence.  If, after a reasonable amount of effort, you find no credible evidence, then by your own same skepticism, your notions of karma, etc. are as unbelievable as gods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scot, if the evaporating of another comforting idea brings up anxiety or sadness for you, there is certainly no need to be embarrassed by that.  It is very common and very human.  Take your time with this inner inquiry, balancing diligence with patience.  Talk to many other skeptics who are further down the road than you, especially about their early period, when they too were uneven in their letting go.  I’m confident that eventually you’ll find clarity as well as a human-based and reality-based reassurance that will be stronger than the belief in invisible gods and intangible forces ever gave you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there are people who can comment on this post who will share with you their difficult early steps, when one comforting belief had fallen away, but they still clung to other comforting beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

The tradition is that green plants first invaded the land in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician"&gt;Ordovician&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian"&gt;Silurian&lt;/a&gt;, if not later, sometime after 500 MYA,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#7note717"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; well after the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian"&gt;Cambrian&lt;/a&gt;, when we first see fossils of animals developing in the ocean (there are actually some from earlier, but those may not be animals, and we know little about them).  However, there are various lines of evidence that there was already extensive land-based photosynthesis going on a good deal earlier,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#3note717"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#4note717"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; including a very recent paper:&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#2note717"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature08213.html"&gt;The late Precambrian greening of the Earth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;by L. Paul Knauth and Martin J. Kennedy, unfortunately behind a paywall&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;, which examined the correspondence of ratios of carbon isotopes and oxygen isotopes in precambrian deposits, specifically from areas influenced by runoff from continents: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here we compile all published oxygen and carbon isotope data for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoproterozoic"&gt;Neoproterozoic&lt;/a&gt; marine carbonates, and consider them in terms of processes known to alter the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"&gt;isotopic&lt;/a&gt; composition during transformation of the initial precipitate into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone"&gt;limestone&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolostone"&gt;dolostone&lt;/a&gt;. We show that the combined oxygen and carbon isotope systematics are identical to those of well-understood &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic"&gt;Phanerozoic&lt;/a&gt; examples that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithified"&gt;lithified&lt;/a&gt; in coastal pore fluids, receiving a large groundwater influx of photosynthetic carbon from terrestrial &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6V5Y-3WTNDHP-B&amp;amp;_user=10&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;_docanchor=&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_searchStrId=960726151&amp;amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=10&amp;amp;md5=57580779d8103cbd8e034b12cda7279a"&gt;phytomass&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than being perturbations to the carbon cycle, widely reported decreases in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C in Neoproterozoic carbonates are more easily interpreted in the same way as is done for Phanerozoic examples. This influx of terrestrial carbon is not apparent in carbonates older than ~850 Myr, so we infer an explosion of photosynthesizing communities on late Precambrian land surfaces. As a result, biotically enhanced weathering generated carbon-bearing soils on a large scale and their detrital sedimentation sequestered carbon. This facilitated a rise in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; necessary for the expansion of multicellular life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This analysis basically plotted the isotope ratios from thousands of observations on a two-dimensional axis, and observed that those from after about 850MYA fell into the same groups whether they were after the beginning of the Cambrian or before.  This leads to the very plausible conclusion that photosynthesizers had colonized the land and were producing large amounts of carbon-rich detritus that was then oxidized and deposited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has some interesting implications:&lt;span&gt; ...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The contrasting isotope data between 850 Myr ago and the Neoproterozoic suggest that the terrestrial expansion of photosynthesizing communities preceded the significant climate perturbations of the late Precambrian glaciations, and was followed by a rise of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;/i&gt;[ref]&lt;i&gt;) and a secular change in terrestrial sediment composition. The onset of significant biotically enhanced terrestrial weathering would have increased the flux of lithophile nutrient elements and clay minerals to continental margins. This would have increased production and burial preservation of organic C towards modern values and consequently facilitated the stepwise rise in atmospheric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; necessary to support multicellularity. The terrestrial expansion of an extensive, simple land biota indicated by the isotope data may thus have been a critical step in the transition from the Precambrian to the Phanerozoic world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The biggest problem with this is the lack of fossils identifiable as from plants, although the "squishier" plants leave few fossils.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is one very important feature of plants that allowed them to colonize the land:  the &lt;a href="http://artksthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/05/serching-for-ubilaterian.html#lignin514"&gt;invention&lt;/a&gt; of mixtures of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin"&gt;lignin&lt;/a&gt; and cellulose that protects them against the "soft" ultraviolet radiation (UV) that makes it through the ozone layer.  This mixture, in turn, depends on a synthesis pathway that begins with an enzyme called Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase (PAL), "&lt;i&gt;which catalyses the first and essential step of the general phenylpropanoid pathway, leading from phenylalanine to p-Coumaric acid and p-Coumaroyl-CoA, the entry points of the flavonoids and lignin routes.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#8note717"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another very recent paper, &lt;a href="http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/7"&gt;A horizontal gene transfer at the origin of phenylpropanoid metabolism: a key adaptation of plants to land&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;by Giovanni Emiliani, Marco Fondi, Renato Fani, and Simonetta Gribaldo&lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; reports an intriguing discovery:  that the gene for this enzyme was almost certainly acquired via horizontal gene transfer from a soil bacterium, or perhaps from a fungus that had in turn acquired it from a soil bacterium.  What they did was to examine the phylogenetic tree of "&lt;i&gt;160 representative sequences&lt;/i&gt;" from various species, discovering that all the genes in plants and fungi are descended from a single ancestor related to those of one bacterial lineage.  This gene "&lt;i&gt;is homologous to histidine ammonia lyase (HAL), which is involved in the catabolism of histidine and is widespread in prokaryotes and eukaryotes &lt;/i&gt;[refs]&lt;i&gt;. It has been proposed that "PAL developed from HAL when fungi and plants diverged from the other kingdoms" &lt;/i&gt;[ref]&lt;i&gt;. However, the current view of eukaryotic evolution based on phylogenetic analyses indicates that fungi and plants do not share an exclusive ancestor &lt;/i&gt;[refs]&lt;i&gt;. In fact, Fungi are more related to Animals than to land plants. Moreover, land plants belong to the phylum Plantae, which also includes Glaucocystophytes, red algae, and green algae &lt;/i&gt;[refs]&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/7/figure/F2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.biology-direct.com/content/figures/1745-6150-4-7-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 1: Phylogenetic tree of HAL/PAL gene.

(From &lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#8note717"&gt;Ref 8&lt;/a&gt; Figure 2)&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, combined with the observations of Knauth &lt;i&gt;et al.&lt;/i&gt;, brings us to an interesting suggestion:  is it possible that, before green plants invaded the land, it was covered with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichens"&gt;lichens&lt;/a&gt;?  Lichens, even today, often grow in areas that are heavily exposed to sunlight (UV) but lack the soil necessary for plant roots (and their symbiotic association with certain fungi).  Absent plants, they may well have been able to colonize just about any area with sufficient rainfall to provide the water they needed.  Lichens are known to invade rock for nutrients,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#6note717"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and even &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;, one of the groups of algae that for symbiotic relationships with fungi to create lichens can chemically erode rocks.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/#5note717"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  The possibility that there was a coating of lichens over most of the Earth's surface as long as 850MYA is quite intriguing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An obvious question is: what, if anything, ate these lichens?  Here I want to hark back to a &lt;a href="http://artksthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/05/ur-ur-ur.html#Multicellularity520"&gt;suggestion&lt;/a&gt; I made a while back, regarding the origin of multi-celled animals, and probably other forms of life: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Could it be that the common ancestor of fungi and animals was actually multinucleate, an amoeba-like creature with lots of nuclei, a flexible shape, and a feeding pattern based on engulfing its food?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a creature would be well positioned to evolve into both fungi and metazoans, with the latter branch having lots of collared flagelli. The question is, why evolve multiple cells? The answer could well be an explosive adaptive radiation of invasive, intracellular predators. Such an explosion would explain the sudden acquisition of multicellularity by many lineages.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It isn't just animals and fungi that would be so descended, and it's quite possible that a variety of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinucleate"&gt;multinucleate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeboids"&gt;amoeboids&lt;/a&gt; were present in these early times that fed on the early lichens I've proposed.  (Indeed, there are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slime_mold"&gt;many such&lt;/a&gt; today.  These may well have lived in small, shaded tunnels during the day (when solar UV may well have threatened them), and come out at night to feed on the upper levels o...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It turns out that strong religious beliefs do not reduce infidelity, although regular churchgoers are more faithful. The study was published last year, but it's new to me at least (thanks to Brian Cleary for bringing it to my attention).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the investigators (David Atkins and Deborah Kessel from Fuller Theological Seminary in California) did was to analyse data from the 1998 General Social Survey of the USA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8sY9bx8acNM/SmDeZDLbWWI/AAAAAAAAAb8/dY9IaWh0i4I/s1600-h/Atkins_2009_fidelity.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:243px;height:400px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8sY9bx8acNM/SmDeZDLbWWI/AAAAAAAAAb8/dY9IaWh0i4I/s400/Atkins_2009_fidelity.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The survey is massive - 3,000 questions - including 37 on different aspects of religion. They grouped these into 9 categories, and analysed them together with other factors that influence infidelity - age, gender, income, and marital happiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, there are some caveats that need to be applied here. This was self-reported infidelity, something that people are likely to under-report, and attendance, which is often over-reported. And it's a cross-sectional analysis, like most of these sorts of things, so cause-and-effect are open to question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it seems that religious attendance is associated with less infidelity. The authors put this down to the likelihood that couples that go to church together are more likely to stay together, for a number of reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I wonder whether regular church goers are simply more conscientious and family oriented than other religious people. That's why they go to church. For non-religious people, I suspect you would find a similar thing for those people who commit to secular activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's another interesting fact that they found. It turns out that there's an interaction with marital happiness. Now, people who are not too happy with their marriage are, unsurprisingly, much more likely to have affairs. However, it's here that the effect of attendance is biggest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who are unhappy with their marriage and who never go to church are 23% more likely to have an affair than people who are happy and never go to church. However, people who are unhappy with their marriage and regularly go to church are only 12% more likely to have an affair than people who are happy and regular church goers,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, church going seems to be effective in keeping people stuck in unhappy marriages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One last thing. From the graph above, you can see that people who feel that they are 'near to god' seem to be &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; likely to have an affair. Atkins &amp;amp; Kessel dug into this a little deeper, and it turns out that people who are near to god but do not go to church are actually 25% more likely to have an affair - which is statistically significant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several possible reasons for this. It could be that these people are disgraced, rejected from their communities, and so exclude from communal activities. Or it could be that these are people who have religious differences from their spouse, and these differences lead to less church going and more infidelity!&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Marriage+and+Family&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1741-3737.2008.00490.x&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Religiousness+and+Infidelity%3A+Attendance%2C+but+not+Faith+and+Prayer%2C+Predict+Marital+Fidelity&amp;amp;rft.issn=0022-2445&amp;amp;rft.date=2008&amp;amp;rft.volume=70&amp;amp;rft.issue=2&amp;amp;rft.spage=407&amp;amp;rft.epage=418&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackwell-synergy.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1111%2Fj.1741-3737.2008.00490.x&amp;amp;rft.au=Atkins%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Kessel%2C+D.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Social+Science%2CReligion%2C+infidelity%2C+marriage"&gt;Atkins, D., &amp;amp; Kessel, D.

It requires a knowledge of natural history, and an understanding of the requirements for allowing that history to happen.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;b&gt;the laws of nature must be such that the Universe can exist as it does.&lt;/b&gt;  Seems like a very simple, innocuous, and self-evident statement.  Yet in this simplicity, we can learn a few important things about the Universe.  Reasoning, using this statement, is often referred to as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle"&gt;the anthropic principle&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is more matter than antimatter in the Universe, for example, and therefore there must be some physical law or process that allows us to produce more matter than antimatter.  Although we don't know what that process is exactly yet, the fact that the Universe is full of matter and relatively devoid of antimatter tells us that this process must exist.  That's one example of anthropic reasoning, and it's valid and (marginally) useful.  The anthropic principle has, exactly once in the course of human history, been used to make a scientific prediction: Fred Hoyle's prediction of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1950s_the_t.php"&gt;the existence of a Carbon-12 excited state that is equal to the mass of three Helium-4 nuclei&lt;/a&gt;.  The Universe is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/making_the_elements_in_the_uni.php"&gt;full of carbon&lt;/a&gt;, and so we need some way to make it, he reasoned.  The only conceivable way to make it from Hydrogen and/or Helium was to have three Helium nuclei combine into a Carbon nucleus, meaning that there had to be an excited state of Carbon-12 that allows this to happen.  Fred Hoyle &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-12#Hoyle_State"&gt;predicted it&lt;/a&gt;, and then Willie Fowler found it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's really it.  That's &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the anthropic principle is useful for, and it upsets me when otherwise respectable scientists hijack it and make exaggerated claims using it.  How?  Instead of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The laws of nature must be such that the Universe can exist as it does,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
there are those who make the claim that &lt;b&gt;the laws of nature exist as they do because human beings are here to observe it&lt;/b&gt;.  This most recently came up because of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th.php"&gt;my article on dark energy&lt;/a&gt;.  Commenter jb &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th.php#c1780780"&gt;paraphrased an argument&lt;/a&gt; often used by string theorists to validate their idea of the Landscape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well maybe our naive calculations for the cosmological constant give us a number too big by a factor of 10^120, but The Landscape(TM) gives us 10^500 possible universes, and at least some of those are going to have the right value, and the others don't matter because there's nobody there."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is problematic for one major reason: &lt;b&gt;it isn't a scientific prediction&lt;/b&gt;.  It doesn't teach us anything new.  If we wanted to use the valid version of the anthropic principle, all we can learn is that the cosmological constant couldn't be too large, or it wouldn't allow for gravitational collapse to occur, creating stars, galaxies, heavy elements, and Scienceblogs readers.  But there's no reason, even with the anthropic principle, for dark energy or the cosmological constant to have the value that it does.  It could be ten, or a hundred, or even a thousand times larger than its observed value, and the Universe would still be here, and similar to the way it is now.  It could also be a tenth, or a millionth, or a googol-th of the value we observe, and the Universe (and you and I, for that matter) would be just fine.  It could also be exactly zero, but it isn't.  The fact is, while we can measure the value that it has, we do not have any understanding of &lt;b&gt;how it got to have that value&lt;/b&gt;.  And the anthropic principle, no matter how you twist it, is of no help in that regard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any type of scientific reasoning is &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; useful when it tells you something you don't already know.  So beware of abuses of the anthropic principle.  They may be logically consistent, and they may be &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt;, but unless they predict something, they're not scientifically useful.

Somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;’It’s hot like hell. And you smell of death!’ Lieselotte said to Neil one morning, not long before I left that particular lab. This is the girl who uses the English language rather like a cluster bomb: inexpertly, and people get hit by shrapnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘My barbecue cooks like hell!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Fenland we had a circular dichroism measuring-type instrument. If you don’t know what one of those is it doesn’t really matter, except to say that this particular one appeared to be carved out of solid granite, sat in a scary room in the basement and ate undergraduates for elevenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that it was quite fragile, consisting of various antediluvian optics and a mercury lamp that absolutely was not, without exception, under any circumstances to be struck in the presence of oxygen. Not ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help even the most suicidal student with this seemingly simple yet somehow elusive directive, the CD machine was connected to two dirty great nitrogen cylinders with an automatic switching device connecting them: the idea being that one would turn on the tap and flush the machine with nitrogen well in advance of wanting to use it (often overnight)—and if one cylinder were to run empty in the night then the other would without a flicker of a metaphorical eyelid take up the burden. And if one cylinder was empty when one came to use the CD machine one would trog off to Stores to replace it. You could tell that the cylinder was empty because there was a useful little dial on it with a red line and the letters ‘E’, ‘M’, ‘P’, ‘T’ and ‘Y’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there were instructions and warning signs all over the room to this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘BC9 expresses like hell!’ Lieselotte said the next morning. ‘Beta octylglucoside is like hell!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘My CD spectra are like hell!’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Lieselotte had stormed into the basement room the previous night, in that inimitable way of hers, switched on all the taps and gone home for the night. In the morning, she’d stormed (like hell? probably) back in, struck the mercury lamp—and yes, you’re a country mile ahead of me—and stormed out again to get her samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not noticing, natch, that the needles on both the nitrogen dials were firmly against the letters ‘E’, ‘M’, ‘P’, ‘T’ and ‘Y’, and probably had been for most of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was she popular?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Humility,” said one parent. “His honesty, and ability to forgive almost instantly,” said another. “His absolute innocence,” ‘responded one parent, ”trust and faith in the world around him. His honesty, and ability to forgive almost instantly.”&lt;br&gt;
“The ability to think about nothing without being a Zen master,” said one parent. ” When I told my son that Zen masters practice their whole lives to block out the world and think about nothing, he laughs, because it comes naturally to him. Perhaps a new vein of research on autism?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have learned to not sweat the small stuff,” said another. ”My kids find joy in the little things and I have also learned to enjoy these moments.  Hearing their laughter is what I enjoy most.  I have, probably most importantly, learned not to pay too much attention to what other people think about me and my family.  Those that have issues with the behaviors of my boys could not walk 10 feet in my shoes, let alone a lifetime. My boys are my heroes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My son, 25, has the uncanny ability to meet and greet everyone he sees with pure, genuine warmth and caring. He shakes hands, makes eye contact, and draws people in to conversation like flies. He asks continuous questions in a&lt;br&gt;
miriad of ways; always seeking, always learning, never fearful. What gifts he brings to the world and to all whom are blessed to meet him. Emulating him is an honor,” said another parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“His exuberance,” said another. “When he is joyful, it is contagious.” Added another parent, “To be absolutely full of energy and life all the time..  My son is so excitable and in the moment, never bogged down by the small stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;

The latest installment of the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt;, that long-running blog carnival of skepticism and critical thinking (hey, four and a half years is a really long time in the blogosphere).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, let TechSkeptic take you on &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/skeptical-journey-through-universe.html"&gt;A Skeptical Journey Through the Universe&lt;/a&gt;, complete with pretty pictures!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up will be &lt;a href="http://beyondtheshortcoat.wordpress.com"&gt;Beyond the Short Coat&lt;/a&gt;, a skeptical medical student who wants to &lt;a href="http://beyondtheshortcoat.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/new-skeptics-circle-up/"&gt;take a shot at this blog carnival&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, July 30. Be sure to send your best skeptical blog posts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I notice that the waiting list for hosts is getting a bit on the short side. In fact, at around two months it's shorter than it's been in a very long time. We must rectify this situation and line up a few more hosts in order to assure the continued survival and prospering of the Circle! So, once again, I ask you, my readers: Do you think you're up for it? Are you skeptic enough? If you think so, take a gander at the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;schedule and archives&lt;/a&gt; and then mosey on over to take a look at the &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-reloaded.html"&gt;guidelines for hosts&lt;/a&gt;. If you still think you have what it takes, then drop me a line at orac@scienceblogs.com, and I'll get you on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_115th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/9Jd8wXx9cmY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247862623613"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8270">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e3a719e65029947b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="cotw"/><title type="html">Comment o’ the Whatever!</title><published>2009-07-17T20:00:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T20:00:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8270" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You guys, I totally slacked last week!

&lt;p&gt;Even if you weren’t at TAM with us, a lot of you did watch along with the streaming video.

&lt;p&gt;Congrats Rebecca and Sid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aw, thanks Yossarian! I laughed and a ton of people nominated you for COTW. Your prize, as is custom, is to come up with next Wednesday’s Afternoon Inquisition. Please send it in using the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt; and include your username.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a sidenote, my favorite nomination for COTW came from Elyse, but it was, sadly, ineligible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the one from Apollo 14 (Apollo 12 was out of the way, and Apollo 13 -- of course -- never made it onto the Moon):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/apollo_landing_sites_40_years/369236main_lroc_apollo14labeled_522x256.jpg" width="512" alt="369236main_lroc_apollo14labeled_522x256.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and from Apollo 15:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/apollo_landing_sites_40_years/369238main_lroc_apollo15labeled_256x256.jpg" width="256" height="256" alt="369238main_lroc_apollo15labeled_256x256.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo 16:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/apollo_landing_sites_40_years/369240main_lroc_apollo16labeled_256x256.jpg" width="256" height="256" alt="369240main_lroc_apollo16labeled_256x256.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and Apollo 17:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/apollo_landing_sites_40_years/369242main_lroc_apollo17labeled_256x256.jpg" width="256" height="256" alt="369242main_lroc_apollo17labeled_256x256.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to Apollo 14.  There's something spectacular that you can see on the Moon in that image.  See that other bright white dot in that image?  See the darker lines that run back and forth?  &lt;b&gt;Those are astronaut footprints and science instruments that we put there!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/apollo_landing_sites_40_years/369228main_ap14labeled_540.jpg" width="512" alt="369228main_ap14labeled_540.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In three days, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing, and I can't think of a better set of images to remind us of arguably &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th.php"&gt;our greatest achievement&lt;/a&gt; as a species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/apollo_landing_sites_40_years.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247862171694"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/shes_all_growed_up.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/610509f56307f225</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">She's all growed up</title><published>2009-07-17T20:52:51Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T20:52:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/GXg1027N6pg/shes_all_growed_up.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/shes_all_growed_up.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two things about my daughter: she's always been a finicky eater, particularly hating seafood, and she is currently living far from home, in Arizona.

The purpose of Launch Pad is to help scifi authors learn astronomy and physics so that they can use more in their work. I think it’s a fantastic idea, and it’s even cooler that it’s got NASA funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big guest is none other than famous author Joe Haldeman, who wrote &lt;em&gt;The Forever War&lt;/em&gt;, a classic piece of satirical fiction (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/15/the-forever-movie/"&gt;which is in the works for a Hollywood movie&lt;/a&gt;, too!). Joe is a great guy and it’ll be good to see him again. Also attending is my bud &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/16/scott-sigler-is-contagious/"&gt;Scott Sigler&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of other very cool people. I’ll be there for only a few days, because I have to get myself to Comic Con on Thursday, woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, folks at Launch Pad posted &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD0g0vbX3VE"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; of Joe talking about amateur astronomy, from a lecture he gave at LP just a few days ago. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

I was busy filling in some gaps and writing the last piece of text for my Östergötland manuscript, an entry for the gazetter at the end of the book. It's been my main project for almost four years. What remains now is fiddling with details (bibliography, figure numbering and captions, test-reader comments, read-through and final copy edit) and collecting/making illustrations.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Regna and Skedevi parishes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In northernmost Östergötland, far from the plains belt, is Lake Regnaren whose surface is 60 meters above current seal level. It empties through a short stream northward into Lake Tisnaren (44 m a.s.l.), through which the province boundary runs. The southern and western shores of Regnaren are a fertile enclave forming the core of Regna parish. Between Regnaren and Tisnaren is Skedevi parish. On the northern shore of Tisnaren are the fertile parishes of Västra and Östra Vingåker in Södermanland province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the construction of modern roads, Regna and Skedevi had much better communication with Södermanland than with central Östergötland. Throughout our period of study the two parishes display a series of elite indicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting in phase D1 of the Migration Period, Regna parish has a stray copper-alloy brooch with punch decorated and gilded Sösdala style silver sheet panels. With the Vendel Period, the destroyed cemetery of Smedjebacken at Ruda in Skedevi very near the province border becomes productive. We now see a seax sword of type ?SAX4, a gilded disc-on-bow brooch with cloisonné and a small domed oval brooch with animal art, all of the Late Vendel Period. From the Viking Period, Smedjebacken has three swords and a type Petersen E lance head. In 1914 Byle Östergård in Skedevi near Ruda yielded a hoard consisting of three gold arm rings, weighing 139 g. Finally, Skedevi parish has a Husby royal manor of the 11th/12th centuries next to the church. The parish name was once probably an appellative: a &lt;em&gt;skedevi&lt;/em&gt; was a pagan sanctuary where ritual horse races were staged (&lt;em&gt;Sv.ortn.lex.&lt;/em&gt; p. 277).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Västra Vingåker parish, we see e.g. a Migration Period openwork bracteate-like gold pendant from Skonäs and from graves at Sävstaholm a Vendel Period display bridle and a garnet-studded Husby type brooch. Östra Vingåker has not to my knowledge produced anything comparable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/book_completed_with_skedevi_an.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/_iOx7ni8ktY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247859628038"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/07/the-computer-at-valet-de-coeur/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/05136ad1abdc158d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">the computer at valet de coeur…</title><published>2009-07-17T19:38:22Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T19:38:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/07/the-computer-at-valet-de-coeur/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;the computer at valet de coeur has a cardboard speech bubble stuck to it saying Linux?

&lt;p&gt;But not everyone agrees that marriage is rational, logical or a good thing. In the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8100"&gt;congratulations thread&lt;/a&gt; this week, several folks mentioned thinking that marriage was inherently irrational, outdated, religious and even misogynistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thread, which was supposed to be about congratulating the happy couple, quickly got derailed so I thought I’d use an AI to spur the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you think? Is it rational to get married? Is it a skeptical, reasonable action to take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When responding, if you feel comfortable with it, let us know if you’re married or not. I’m curious &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"Man the Toolmaker" was our celebrated designation.  The hominin fossil &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Homo habilis&lt;/span&gt; (or "handy" man) was even defined within our genera primarily because the skeleton was associated with stone implements.  However, when Jane Goodall discovered chimpanzees using modified sticks at Gombe to "fish" for termites, Louis Leakey famously cabled her that:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Now we must redefine man, redefine tool - or accept chimpanzees as human.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now people should stop insisting on singling out specific human behaviors and declaring them to be unique in the natural world.  Invariably, whatever special attributes humans possess, other primates do in some form as well.  For many years it's been argued that humans are the only primates that will adopt unrelated individuals to care for as their own.  This has been conventional wisdom because it doesn't make intuitive sense according to the rigid definition of biological fitness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/07/adoption_in_non-human_primates.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/07/adoption_in_non-human_primates.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Outside that organization, though, he’s working on a project of his own: &lt;a href="http://fcnp.com/news/4745-fc-little-league-father-starts-petition-for-religious-freedom.html"&gt;Getting references to God removed from Little League baseball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s doing this locally, in his town of Falls Church, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ritter, an assistant coach on a league team and whose son, Vincent, is a first-year player, was present for the opening ceremonies held at Westgate Park in Falls Church last April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the event, Ritter said a Methodist preacher was invited to the field for a religious invocation, and &lt;strong&gt;the children then recited the “Little League Pledge,” which contained the phrase, “I trust in God.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he recognizes the league is privately owned, Ritter said the league “is a secular organization” and the presence of religion “interferes with the ability to teach your child” and fails to recognize “Falls Church’s religiously diverse community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Falls Church has a broad religious community of Catholics, Buddhists, Jews and Muslims,” he said. “Everyone doesn’t have the same idea of God, or believes in God.” Ritter identifies himself as an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritter added, “I wouldn’t want someone to give an invocation saying there is no God. I just want the Little League to treat my son by the Golden Rule, to treat him as they would want to be treated.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Boy Scouts of America, Little League is a private organization, so a lawsuit wouldn’t work unless there was blatant funding from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no doubt God is present at games across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/About_Our_Organization/pledge.htm"&gt;Here’s the Little League Pledge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;I trust in God&lt;br&gt;
I love my country&lt;br&gt;
And will respect its laws&lt;br&gt;
I will play fair&lt;br&gt;
And strive to win&lt;br&gt;
But win or lose&lt;br&gt;
I will always do my best &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue rarely gets as much traction as Boy Scout cases — you don’t hear about Little League coaches getting kicked out from their volunteer positions for being atheists — but it’s just as frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if other atheists have had to deal with this issue.  Did you or your kids have to say the Pledge?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their argument has become so absurd and so petty that it seems a waste of time anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All they've done is confessed that they are on a personal vendetta: they are very upset with me, they admit that my existence is a central reason that they left the scienceblogs network, and you can just feel the roiling resentment that people &lt;i&gt;dare&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;criticize&lt;/i&gt; them, persistently and at length…and it&amp;#39;s all my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not address their scapegoating of PZ Myers and Pharyngula in my reviews of the book because it was a palpably strange bit of personal antagonism on their part, and I confined my disagreement to the poverty of their other arguments. It is interesting to see my assessment of the anti-me sentiment now confirmed. It's unfortunate, too. Their book is very thin on ideas and evidence, and it detracts from it further that they spend two chapters whining about people who have annoyed them. It's unprofessional, and it reveals their own poor comprehension of how the web works. This petulant bravado, for example, is simply unreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For too long, people in the science blogosphere have tiptoed around Myers. After all, he can send a lot of angry commenters your way. And he, and they, are unrelenting in their criticisms, their attacks, and so on. Just read our threads over the last week—it&amp;#39;s all there, the vast majority from people who have not read our book and do not seem inclined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But we&amp;#39;re not afraid of Myers or his commenters. They can leave hundreds of posts on our blog-we readily allow it—but our book will be read by a different and far more open-minded audience. It&amp;#39;s already happening. And that audience will largely agree that Myers&amp;#39; communion wafer desecration was offensive and counterproductive, and that more generally, he epitomizes the current problems with the communication of science on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not noticed any tip-toeing around me at all — it is simply bizarre to argue that people are afraid to criticize me because something horrible might happen: they might get criticized back. That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ve got, after all: I do not have clout in government or science funding agencies, I do not have an army of ninjas, people can howl all they want about me — and they do! — and all that will happen at worst is they&amp;#39;ll get a brief flood of traffic and a bunch of comments on their blog. This is something most bloggers &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt;. To claim bravery because they aren't intimidated by the possibility that I might link to their articles is damned silly. And I have read over the last week's worth of comments on their blog: it's a bunch of people on the internet arguing over &lt;i&gt;both sides&lt;/i&gt;, and many of the angriest (and dumbest) are Mooney's own defenders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They really don't get it. I have no power except as a focus for a lot of like-minded people; if I were to vanish, those people would still exist, and would still be hammering at the foolishness that Mooney and Kirshenbaum emit. There is a growing minority in this country, this Unscientific America that Mooney and Kirshenbaum write about, which is fed up with the false privilege granted to religion, that wants science to have a more prominent role, that is willing to be outspoken and critical, and that is more than a little exasperated with the tepid apologists for the status quo who believe that making nice with the Unscientific part of America is the solution. That minority wants a voice, and they will have it whether I'm part of it or not. They are also our only hope for &lt;i&gt;changing&lt;/i&gt; Unscientific America. Ultimately, the only way we can get a Scientific America is by challenging and criticizing the proponents of anti-science and un-science…and all the &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2843"&gt;Colgate twins&lt;/a&gt; can do is protest in horror at anyone who wants to rock the boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't a problem with the communication of science on the internet, it is a strength. We have a platform from which we, with many voices, can roar. Use it, don't muffle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, though, the problem with their book, the one they've avoided despite the fact that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php"&gt;I brought it up in my review&lt;/a&gt;, reiterated it in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_still_use.php"&gt;my response to their 'rebuttal'&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/coyne_on_unscientific_america.php"&gt;Jerry Coyne discussed briefly&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2841"&gt;Ophelia Benson skewered with some pointed questions&lt;/a&gt;, is that they are thin on substance. Bellyaching about me personally is entertaining and has brought them some short-lived blog traffic, but all that is is a distraction from what ought to be the topic of conversation: how do we get the public to think scientifically and become better informed about real world matters, and make decisions rationally? I push one obvious strategy: the erosion of a major source of delusional, sloppy thinking, religion. I do not pretend that this is the only useful strategy, however. What Mooney and Kirshenbaum could have done was provide a practical alternative, with details and specific suggestions that we could then productively wrangle over. They have not. That's the most obvious deficiency of their responses so far (other than their &lt;a href="http://brian.carnell.com/articles/2009/does-chris-mooney-even-know-what-is-in-unscientific-america"&gt;frequent distortions of what others and they themselves say&lt;/a&gt;), a strange reluctance to actually discuss what is in their book. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_still_use.php"&gt;I've already spilled the beans about their Grand Solution&lt;/a&gt;, so they might as well try to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I predict that they won't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John Corigliano, "Fantasia on an Ostinato"&lt;/b&gt;: Corigliano is absolutely my
  favorite modern composer. He writes stunningly beautiful music. This is a wonderfully
  subtle piece: unaccompanied solo piano. Just incredible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isis, "Not in Rivers, But in Drops"&lt;/b&gt;: The transition between the last one
   and this just about scared me out of my seat. From solo piano to loud, heavy
   post-rock. Once the shock of the volume change was past, I love this track. Isis
   is a really fantastic group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dirty Three, "Amy"&lt;/b&gt;: Dirty Three is another interesting transition. DT is another
   post-rock, but from the opposite end of the post-rock spectrum from Isis. DT is mostly
   accoustic, heavily classically influenced post-rock. Most of their studio work doesn't have
   the energy or the focus of a band like Isis, but it's still very good stuff. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trans Am, "(Interlude)"&lt;/b&gt;: from post-rock to math rock. Trans Am is a pretty neat
  little band. Not nearly as good as some of the others in my collection, but definitely fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jadis, "Need to Breathe"&lt;/b&gt;: Finally, some neo-prog. Jadis is a new neo-progressive 
  group that's heavily influenced by Marillion. They're pretty good. Not great, but good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Broken Social Scene, "Our Faces Split the Coast in Half"&lt;/b&gt;: a big disappointment. I heard Broken Social Scene being interviewed on NPR. They're a Canadian collective, which has
some overlap with the deities of postrock, "Godspeed you Black Emperor". The bits they played
live sounded great. But when I got one of their albums, it's profoundly dull. Pretty much
the only time I ever listen to it is when it comes up in a random playlist, and then
I usually wind up skipping past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Echolyn, "The End is Beautiful"&lt;/b&gt;: very good neo-progressive rock. Maybe a tad on the emo side,
   but the quality of the musicians more than makes up for that. Seriously good stuff,
   very highly recommended. Includes a really beautiful fugue section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gong, "Magdalene"&lt;/b&gt;:  Brilliant prog-rock, with nothing neo about it. Gong has been
  together since the 70s (although I just recently found out about them). They're one of the
  most amazing bands I've ever heard. Very strange, very silly at times, but always
  musically brilliant. They've got unusual instrumentation - very woodwind heavy for a rock
  band. I can't recommend them highly enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alan Holdsworth, "The Sixteen Men of Tain"&lt;/b&gt;: Alan Holdsworth is someone who's music
  I simultaneously love and hate. The guy is, without a doubt, one of the most skillful
  and artistic guitar players ever. He can play fast or slow with every note being crisp
  and perfect. He can play rock, jazz, and classical guitar with equal skill. And yet,
  most of the time, he leaves me cold. He's like a guitar playing machine - perfect in every
  mechanical way, but somehow, his playing just totally lacks humanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flower Kings, "The Blade of Cain"&lt;/b&gt;: The perfect ending for a FRT: my 
  favorite band, the Flower Kings. These guys are &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; neo-progressive band
  to watch. Brilliant composition, brilliant performances. They come closer to musical
  perfection than any other rock band I've ever seen or heard. I found a youtube clip

Geoff tells me that mine is 8, or maybe 9.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;According to the Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A person's Erdős–Bacon number is [..] the sum of one's Erdős number—which measures the "collaborative distance" in authoring mathematical papers between that individual and Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős—and one's Bacon number—which represents the number of links, through roles in films, by which the individual is separated from American actor Kevin Bacon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Erdős number is 3 [J. B. Kruskal and M. Y. Liberman, 1983: &amp;quot;The symmetric time-warping problem: From continuous to discrete&amp;quot;, in D. Sankoff and J.B. Kruskal (eds.), Time Warps, String Edits and Macromolecules, Addison-Wesley; A. J. Hoffman and J. B. Kruskal, 1956: &amp;quot;Integral boundary points of convex polyhedra&amp;quot;, Annals of Mathematics Study 38:223-241; P. Erdős, S. Fajtlowicz and A. J. Hoffman, 1980: &amp;quot;Maximum degree in graphs of diameter 2″, Networks 10:87-96.] And apparently Geoff&amp;#39;s Bacon number is 4, which might entitle me to a Bacon number of 5 or 6,  depending on which activities are counted as the right kind of graph edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually possible that my Bacon number is lower, since I&amp;#39;ve been interviewed on radio (does that count?) and television over the years by personalities whose Bacon number might well be lower than 5. And while it&amp;#39;s unlikely that I&amp;#39;ll lower my Erdős number in the future, I certainly might lower my Bacon number. Something to look forward to…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247856240762"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/update_your_dictionaries.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44559b8a9c4adf0b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Update your dictionaries</title><published>2009-07-17T18:39:03Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T18:39:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/l0Jt5CSa8sg/update_your_dictionaries.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/update_your_dictionaries.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The new word is &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/we-have-a-winner/"&gt;faitheists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/update_your_dictionaries.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/l0Jt5CSa8sg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247855272327"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/07/the_giants_shoulders_13.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3659fd30ce78606c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivalia"/><title type="html">The Giant's Shoulders #13</title><published>2009-07-17T18:52:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T18:52:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ScienceAfterSunclipse/~3/7U-IoGtIuTM/the_giants_shoulders_13.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2009/07/the_giants_shoulders_13.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The thirteenth instalment of &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/2009/07/16/the-giants-shoulders-13-a-day-at-the-fair/"&gt;The Giant's Shoulders&lt;/a&gt;, the blogohedronic celebration of classic science, is available at &lt;a href="http://skullsinthestars.com/2009/07/16/the-giants-shoulders-13-a-day-at-the-fair/"&gt;Dr. SkySkull's place&lt;/a&gt;.

I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/06/a_beautiful_mammoth_fossil_dis.php" title=""&gt;promised I'd try to go and see it myself&lt;/a&gt; on my recent trip to Belgrade. And I did get to see it. But the story is more fun than just that.... ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I tried to get in touch with Dr.Miomir Korać, the Director of the Archaeological park &lt;a href="http://www.viminacium.org.rs/" title=""&gt;Viminacium&lt;/a&gt; to ask for permission to photograph the fossil as well as to interview him. After a couple of e-mail addresses bounced, I got what I think is the correct address...but got no response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to Belgrade, I asked my contacts there about this and, as is usually the process there, a friend of a friend of a friend was willing to take me to the site. They also tried to contact Korać, as well as their own bosses, but nobody returned their calls. It is vacation time in Serbia right now, and people are not easily reachable (even by cell phones, not to mention the Web - Serbia has a distressingly low rate of Internet use for Europe). So, what to do? They decided to take me there anyway, and deal with the bosses later. Thus, I will not use their names or photos here (in case they get in trouble) and I told them that I am still interested in talking to and interviewing both Korać and their bosses if they want to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why all this worry about bypassing the protocol? Because the fossil is in the middle of a huge open-pit coal mine &lt;a href="http://wikimapia.org/7091679/Drmno" title=""&gt;Drmno&lt;/a&gt; (you see, there are maps and satellite images all over the Web), near &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostolac" title=""&gt;Kostolac&lt;/a&gt;, a mine that provides something like 1/8th of electrical power of Serbia and is thus of strategic importance. For all they knew, I could have been an American spy! But fortunately they trusted the friends of friends of friends that I was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, last Thursday, I got up early and went to the bus station. I took a bus to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po%C5%BEarevac" title=""&gt;Pozarevac&lt;/a&gt;, a trip I took a million times as a kid. But this time, it was different. The bus was new and modern and clean and comfortable and smelled good. The music was discrete and not the worst of the worst of the newly-composed "folk". The bus also started the trip exactly on time (to the second!) and arrived exactly on time. Not whenever the bus driver felt inspired to drive as it used to be once upon a time. Capitalism, baby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a couple of hours in Pozarevac until our car that was to take us to Drmno arrived. So we sat in a cafe and got to know each other....over four huge shots of home-made slivovitz! I did not even have breakfast yet! I tried to dilute it by having a couple of big Turkish coffees, a couple of Cokes, some mineral water and a couple of handfuls of peanuts, but still, it was a tough and heroic deed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viminacium" title=""&gt;Viminacium&lt;/a&gt; or even the town of Kostolac, we went straight to the mine (where we had yet another shot of brandy). The office building is nice, large and clean - and powered (yes, right next to all that coal) by a large battery of solar panels. The titles on all the office doors we passed indicated to me that quite a lot of science (mainly geology, but also stuff like vibrations, etc.) is going on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we got in a jeep and went into the mine itself. I took a lot of pictures of the mine - it is huge and it looks very tidy (I've seen a bigger one, Kolubara, when I was a kid, and remember it being, in my childish eyes, quite a mess). As such pictures may compromise (at least in some eyes) the national security and since they are not too related to the fossil, I will not post them here. But here is one, taken from a considerable distance (as much as my little camera could zoom in), showing just a small segment of one side of the open pit - the arrow points to the enclosure where the mammoth is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/behold_the_mammoth/Drmno%20kop.jpg" width="448" height="336" alt="Drmno kop.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are at least 50 meters of the mine 'wall' hanging right above it - something that mine engineers are now trying to figure out how to secure against sliding, as the mammoth will stay in the spot and be seen by tourists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fossil was discovered in a part of the mine that is not in use any more - the coal extracted now is deeper down in the pit. It was found in a layer of yellow sand by a bulldozer driver for a local road-paving company that has a contract with the mine to come in and take away, for free, the sand and gravel they need for road construction. He was happily bulldozing the gravel when he heard a 'clang' noise at the blade. He immediatelly stopped the machine, went down to see and, upon seeing a small tip of something that looked like a bone, decided to call the mine bosses who, in turn, called the people from the Archaeological park &lt;a href="http://www.viminacium.org.rs/" title=""&gt;Viminacium&lt;/a&gt;. The archaeological treasure of the area is a source of everyone's pride there, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out that this is an amazingly well-preserved and almost completely articulated fossil of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammuthus_meridionalis" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mammuthus meridionalis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Southern Mammoth that is thought to have migrated from North Africa to Southern Europe around 2 million years ago and is probably the ancestral species of all the other, younger species of mammoths found in the Northern hemisphere. The Southern Mammoth had much shorter and finer hair than the later Woolly Mammoth and probably went extinct when the next Ice Age appeared in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a much older species, the Southern Mammoth has not left as many or as complete fossils as the Woolly Mammoth either. Several have been found around Europe (Spain, Bulgaria, Sweden) and one has been mounted and is on display at the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mammuthus_meridionalis.JPG" title=""&gt;Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the Serbian fossil, with its exquisite level of preservation, will be carefully studied by Serbian and international teams of scientists for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/behold_the_mammoth/sator.jpg" width="448" height="336" alt="sator.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fossil, found at the depth of 27 meters, was about 4m high, 6m long and weighed about 10 tons. It is a female and was named 'Vicky'. There has been probably no big tectonic activity in the area for about 1 million years - how old this one is estimated to be (the more precise measures of age will be performed soon) - as earthquakes would, over time, have disassembled a fossil embedded in sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the fossil is in sand is on one hand a great gift - cleaning up is easy and fast - but on the other hand it is a big headache as well - how do you move it!? If it was embedded in rock, they could cut the entire slab out and move it to a museum for cleaning and restoration. This is a major mine, close to major roads - there is plenty of heavy machinery, people who can competently use it, and engineers who can figure out how to do it. This is not like finding a dinosaur in the middle of nowhere - technology is at hand and can be used on the spot. But this fossil is not embedded in rock - it is in sand. So what can one do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/behold_the_mammoth/znak.jpg" width="448" height="336" alt="znak.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they could disarticulate the skeleton, take each separate bone to a museum and rearticulate it there. That would take a lot of people, a lot of effort and a lot of time - and something would be lost in the process: the exact position and location of the fossil in the place where it was buried. Another way would be to freeze the sand around it, lift the whole slab and take it to a museum where the sand would thaw. This they think is too risky - the freezing and thawing may damage the fossil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/behold_the_mammoth/ulaz%20u%20sator.jpg" width="448" height="336" alt="ulaz u sator.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the mine and the museum struck a compromise. The fossil will stay in place. The mine will secure the 50 meters of overhanging soil above the fossil and build two roads: one for the tourists who come to see Vicky, the other for the mine to use for driving around its heavy machinery into the pit. The museum will finish the cleaning and the analysis of the fossil and build an enclosure that will protect the fossil and accommodate the visitors (I am assuming that a museum shop will be built to bring in some revenue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of my palaeontologist readers have better ideas for either preservation or moving, leave them in the comments or contact me. They are all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2009/07/behold_the_mammoth/ulaz%20u%20sator2.jpg" width="448" height="336" alt="ulaz u sator2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now the fossil is protected from immediate weather and light by a small canvas tent, which also means that I was not able to take pictures from a distance greater than a couple of feet. I had to crouch to get inside and could only take close-shot photos. I also could not find a good object to include in some shots as a size reference. But I took a lot of pictures from many angles and I hope you can see how wonderfully intact and well-articulated the fossil is. The rest of the pictures are under the fold, followed by a YouTube video (not shot by me) where you can see the fossil as it looked when it was first shown to the media:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/behold_the_mammoth.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/behold_the_mammoth.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/aRTOsT1t7qM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247853154304"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1583">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a945f4382d42c1f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">Erdős?</title><published>2009-07-17T17:49:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T17:49:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1583" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been a couple of years since we looked at Erdős numbers here on Language Log; see the posting by Sally Thomason &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004383.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the ones by by Geoff Pullum &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004384.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004404.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a snappy, one-word name for those atheists who are nonetheless soft on faith (i.e., atheist accommodationists).  You know them — the kind of people, like Michael Ruse,  who say, “I am an atheist, but . . .”.   In other words, the folks who, says Daniel Dennett, have “belief in belief.” That’s a snappy phrase, but it ain’t one word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RULES:  Contest open for one week, answers on this thread.  Only two submissions per person.  Be clever, as it’s the word I want to use on this website from now on.  PLEASE do not post anything on this thread except your entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately there were two cute responses, &lt;strong&gt;Jesuits&lt;/strong&gt; (by Darkling) and &lt;strong&gt;Unitarians&lt;/strong&gt; (by blueollie).  Funny, yes, but not good for discussing the problem, as these terms already refer to something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader Rieux pointed out that Dawkins himself discussed &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,318,Im-an-atheist-BUT---,Richard-Dawkins"&gt;the variety of of accommodationist “I-am-an-atheist but”ers&lt;/a&gt; on his website (Screechy Monkey suggested the name “&lt;strong&gt;Butters&lt;/strong&gt;” for this), but Dawkins never came up with a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very popular entry was the suggestion &lt;strong&gt;Templetons&lt;/strong&gt; (Adam M). Sadly, it is inaccurate because many Templetonites are in fact religious, and so don’t fit the bill as atheists. Moving on to the near winners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUNNERS UP &lt;/strong&gt;(in no particular order)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Godlycoddlers&lt;/strong&gt; (by Kitty’sBitch), also winner of the Most Mellifluous Entry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placatheists&lt;/strong&gt; (by Todd Shackleford)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credophiles&lt;/strong&gt; (by Thanny). Winner of the Most Pejorative Entry Prize&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Betraytheists&lt;/strong&gt; (Macronencer)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muzzle-ems&lt;/strong&gt; (Sigmund) Winner of the Especially Cute Award&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one entry clearly stood out as being not only snappy, but also short, to the point, and clever.  There were several versions with different spellings, but I gave the award to the first entry that was spelled in the proper way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that winner is . . . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; FAITHEISTS&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt;**&lt;/strong&gt; contributed by Divalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be the word that I use from now on, so I expect everyone to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divalent, please contact me (a little Googling will produce my email) so that I can get your address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks to all for your brainpower, which just goes to show that atheists are indeed funnier!&lt;/p&gt;

Insects in turn have evolved various counter-measures to evade capture. Some species have ears which are in tune to the echolocation signals, while others are capable of performing complex &lt;a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/152/1/17.pdf"&gt;evasive flight maneuvers&lt;/a&gt; in response to the clicks produced by attacking bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Tiger moths have evolved the ability to produce ultrasonic clicks in response to attacking bats. However, the function of these clicks was unclear, although decades of research has led to a number of hypotheses. The clicks may act to startle attacking bats, or they may be an acoustic signal which warns them that the moth is unpalatable. A study published in today's issue of the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; provides the first clear evidence for the third hypothesis - that the clicks interfere with (or "jam") the bats' echolocation signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2009/07/tiger_moths_jam_bat_sonar.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurophilosophy/2009/07/tiger_moths_jam_bat_sonar.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/YsBw/~4/Ejj52STRwmY" height="1" width="1"&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Two of the items addressed in the training are 1) what does "advocacy" mean, and 2) what is the difference between an "advocate" and "self-advocate?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very start of this blog, Kristina wrote about what "advocate" &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/so_what_is_autism_advocacy"&gt;means to her&lt;/a&gt;.  I've covered &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/manuals_for_self-advocates"&gt;manuals&lt;/a&gt; for self-advocates, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/un_convention_on_disability_rights_and_manuals_for_self-advocates_part_ii"&gt;more manuals&lt;/a&gt; for self-advocates, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_resource_for_transitioning_to_college"&gt;yet more manuals&lt;/a&gt; for self-advocates.  The term "autism advocacy" is steeped in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/divisions"&gt;the divide&lt;/a&gt; between individuals with competing motives and agendas, which plays out in the daily comment dramas all across the blogsphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm not sure the term "autism advocacy" is the issue.  From the "Self Advocacy 101" training:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A self-advocate is someone who expresses and enforces ("speaks for") their own needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advocate is someone who expresses and enforces ("speaks for") the needs of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A person can be both a self-advocate and an advocate.  Or just one of the two.  Or neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues may lie not with the term, but with the with the deeper question "Who can express and enforce needs for--who can 'speak for'--whom?"  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is an individual on the spectrum allowed to speak for them self?  To self-advocate?  (This is not as obvious an answer as it may appear on the surface--how many ways are there to disempower someone who is trying to stand up for their own rights?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when people in a community ask an individual on the spectrum to speak on the community's behalf?  To be an advocate?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when people outside a community fail to understand that an individual was only intending to speak for their own community or for themselves, and never intended to speak for those outside the community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens in the inverse when people claim to speak for others who expressly do not want to be spoken for?  When there is an essential conflict whereby standing up for one's self literally means refusing to let others speak on one's behalf?&lt;/p&gt;

This is so so so freaking cool: &lt;strong&gt;the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has taken pictures of the Apollo landing sites!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/lro_apollo11site.jpg" alt="LRO spots Apollo 11 landing site"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holy Haleakala! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right" border="1px"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center" cellpadding="10px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LEM-linedrawing.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/lunarmodule_diagram.jpg" alt="Lunar Module diagram"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LM diagram from Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s EXACTLY how I pictured it would look. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html"&gt;That picture&lt;/a&gt; shows the lower half of the Lunar Module, the part that stayed behind on the Moon when Armstrong and Aldrin blasted back up off the surface. It was essentially dead weight, so the LM was designed to split in half, with the top half (the aptly-named Ascent Module — click on the diagram on the right for details) going back up into orbit to meet with Michael Collins in the Command Module. From there they returned to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Descent Module is about 4 meters or so across, and the image, above taken when the Sun was low on the horizon, clearly shows the DM and its shadow cast across the lunar surface. The region where they landed was fairly smooth, so the module is the only thing large enough in the image to cast an appreciable shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Look at that! Physical, tangible evidence that human beings walked on the surface of the Moon. And not just that: we did it again and again. Behold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/369228main_ap14labeled_540.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/07/lro_apollo14site.jpg" alt="LRO images Apollo 14 site"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the Apollo 14 landing site, &lt;strong&gt;and you can see where the lunar surface was disturbed by the astronauts bootprints!&lt;/strong&gt; Some of that may also be tracks from a wheelbarrow-like device called the Modularized Equipment Transporter which Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell used to help them carry equipment and samples to and from the lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh man oh man oh man! And mind you, these pictures are not even the highest resolution LRO can provide; future observation will have twice this much detail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I love this&lt;/em&gt;. Not because I needed proof we went, of course. But there is just something about seeing &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; pictures after all these years. Apollo may seem like ancient history, but those artifacts on the Moon are still sitting there, in many ways as fresh as the day they were placed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of human history, there are many dividing lines we can arbitrarily assign. Before and after the use of atomic weapons, before and after the invention of the light bulb, before and after this war or that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one dividing line that can inspire us, fill us with wonder, make us dream of bigger goals, higher aspirations, better ways to live our lives for the future. And that is the dividing line between the time we were a race shackled to the ground, confined to a single planet… &lt;em&gt;and the time a human being stepped foot on another world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it is, in pictures and in fact. This is what these pictures mean. We humans spend a lot of time looking around, looking out, looking down. But sometimes, for just a brief moment, &lt;em&gt;we look up&lt;/em&gt;. We did it once before, and it’s time to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247849199885"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/17/all-creatures-great-and-small-hosts-and-parasites-science-tattoos/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aec4c2c3e685e84a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Tattoo Emporium"/><title type="html">All Creatures Great And Small, Hosts and Parasites [Science Tattoos]</title><published>2009-07-17T16:27:11Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T16:27:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/17/all-creatures-great-and-small-hosts-and-parasites-science-tattoos/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/stingray440.jpg" alt="stingray440.jpg" align="left"&gt;Marcus, a parasitologist in Brazil, writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It is an undescribed species of freshwater stingray from the Family Potamotrygonidae (&lt;em&gt;Potamotrygon&lt;/em&gt; sp.n.) that has being described by Dr. Marcelo Rodrigues Carvalho from Universidade de São Paulo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

2. An ectoparasite from needlefish (Belonidae) that I am redescribing. The parasite, &lt;em&gt;Nudaciraxine gracilis&lt;/em&gt; belongs to the Class Monogenoidea (Platyhelminthes). This parasite group is characterized by having  anchors, clamps, and hooks at the end of the body (named as haptor) used to attached to the host gills.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Senate is up next for a similar bill, and Christians are freaking the eff out. Who can blame them? Groups like &lt;a title="godhatesfags.com" href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/"&gt;Westboro Baptist Church&lt;/a&gt; base their whole schtick on the fact that homosexuality is so against Christianity that it makes bridges collapse and levies break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protected activities include “the exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment and peaceful picketing or demonstration,” according to the legislation. The bill also states that no one can be prosecuted solely for expressing racial, religious, political, or other beliefs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, the bill adds that “speech, conduct or activities consisting of planning for, conspiring to commit, or committing an act of violence” is not constitutionally protected. That sentence is alarming to conservative Christian groups such as &lt;a title="Families only exist in the Bible" href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/"&gt;Focus on the Family&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.frc.org/"&gt;Family Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, who say the law would severely hamper Christians’ freedom to address homosexuality in sermons, radio programs, and other public venues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of crap are these people planning that a legislative bill banning &lt;strong&gt;violence and violence-related activities&lt;/strong&gt; is going to disrupt how they deal with homosexuals? Apparently they can still blast fire and brimstone from the pulpit, not that they would have stopped anyway. According to a Focus on the Family representative, a church member who goes out and commits a crime against a gay person leaves the pastor of the church open to prosecution as well. And here I thought Christianity was supposed to be about loving fellow man [no pun intended], acceptance and forgiveness… If that’s the case, shouldn’t pastors be teaching their flock &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to go out and recreate the &lt;a href="http://www.matthewshepard.org/site/PageServer"&gt;Matthew Shepard&lt;/a&gt; case? Instead they’re shaking in their robes over what might happen if one of their members does what they’ve been preaching about for eons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to [Congressmen Louie Gohmert, R-Texas] if a religious leader teaches “that homosexuality is wrong and someone goes out and commits a crime of violence then [the religious leader] can be arrested for inducing that person to do it and under existing Federal Law you are as guilty as the one who committed the act of violence.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dobson then quipped in response, “So much for the 1st amendment.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not one for censorship, but these people are teaching hatred. They are teaching it to people who they &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; are likely to act upon it, and that is a statement coming from a government official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bill does not adequately protect Christians from gay activists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity, I googled “gay activists attack church,” as I’ve never heard anything about a bunch of gay guys or a bunch of lesbians inflicting the kind of hatred on church goers that they have received from them. First of all, the only articles on the first page are by religious organizations – I see no news or legal articles on the matter. Secondly, the main article that popped up and was posted by more than one of the search results was &lt;a title="&amp;quot;Jesus is a Homo.&amp;quot;" href="http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=30504"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, in which a self-proclaimed radical group called &lt;a href="http://bashbacknews.wordpress.com/"&gt;Bash Back&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated a Catholic service by waving a rainbow flag and pulling fire alarms. Every way of life and every philosophy has extremists. If churches &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; have an anarchist group to worry about as far as interruptions in their way of living, they’re doing well. Gays, lesbians and transexuals have &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; religion, extremist or not, scrutinizing them, considering them lesser people and, in some cases, acting out against them in violent displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bill is a fantastic thing, and I hope it passes with flying colors. It’s meant to protect the livelihoods of people who have been discriminated against for far too long, not just take the “fun” out of religion. However, the religious &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; feel that it’s directed slightly towards them. Frankly, if it weren’t for them, the bill would likely not be needed. Not much good can come from the soapbox mentality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chelsea</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247847805241"><id gr:original-id="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2009/07/17/on-pandemic-influenzas/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a82988efdfe3fc61</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">On pandemic influenzas</title><published>2009-07-17T10:19:22Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T10:19:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/I-W3sy3qSVw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2009/07/17/on-pandemic-influenzas/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Here we estimated the evolutionary history and inferred date of introduction to humans of each of the genes for all 20th century pandemic influenza strains.

Today, I'll explain a bit about population variation in reproductive function, and how it may relate to the conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Population variation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both the efficacy of hormonal contraception and its non-contraceptive benefits are reduced if women do not take their prescriptions properly, and there are many reasons women do this: poor education regarding what constitutes ‘perfect use,’ ambivalence about their choice of contraception, or dissatisfaction regarding side effects. Baerwald and colleagues found different degrees of suppressed ovulation depending on when contraceptives were started; if hormonal contraception was initiated at or before ovarian follicles had reached 10mm, suppression occurred in all cases, but became increasingly less likely as follicles increased in size (Baerwald et al. 2006). One of the methods of initiating hormonal contraceptives involves the idea of a ‘Sunday Start’ where women start taking the medication the first Sunday after their last menses, rather than on the first day of menses. The reasoning is that it is easier to keep track of pills (or patches or rings) when one starts each week on a Sunday rather than on whatever day menses happens to begin. Unfortunately, significant follicular growth can occur between menses and the start of the contraception, depending on the individual and the day menses began. This can mean a woman can think she is protected from pregnancy for that cycle, but has ovulated and thus at a much greater risk for unwanted pregnancy. If a woman stops and starts – due to difficulties obtaining her prescription, traveling, or dissatisfaction with the brand of contraceptive she chooses – she may have many ovulatory cycles, or at the least many cycles where her follicles are growing and regressing. My worry is that this could lead to polycystic ovaries or even mutations during tissue remodeling that could lead to ovarian cancer (this is a hypothesis, not an observation or statement of empirical evidence).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other reasons a woman may not stay on hormonal contraception and thus may not have ‘perfect use’ is that her normal range of variation in endogenous hormones is different from the American norm. Women from developing countries tend to have lower circulating levels of reproductive hormones (for examples directly related to contraception, see Bentley 1996; Ellison 1990; Vitzthum et al. 2004); this means their responsiveness to the exogenous hormones of contraceptives will be different, just like with overweight American women but at the other end of the spectrum. Bentley (1996) reports significant interpopulation variation in pharmacokinetic properties of hormonal contraceptives; this means that different women have different physiological responses to hormones, even when taking the same dose. She also reviewed the literature regarding interpopulation variation in side effects experienced by women on hormonal contraception (Bentley 1996). Vitzthum and colleagues (2001) report shorter duration of menses for samples of Bolivian versus Chicago women, and significantly lower endogenous hormone concentrations in Bolivian versus Chicago women (Vitzthum et al. 2004). The penultimate paragraph of the 2004 article is the most telling:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The present study also reaffirms the conclusion of others that hormonal contraceptive dosages designed for U.S. women and other industrialized countries may be excessively high for women in developing countries, resulting in severe side-effects leading to discontinuation and, potentially, unplanned pregnancy. We have often heard Bolivian women and health workers express concern about negative experiences with hormonal contraceptives. Contrary to arguments that noncompliance is more a matter of education than biology, these data succinctly support the reports of these women that negative sequelae of hormonal contraceptives are more than an imagined problem.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we have Bentley’s review of variation in effects on contraception, several decades of literature on population variation in ovarian function via ecology, and anecdotal evidence from the mouths of women from developing countries; put together, they tell a story about a broad spectrum of women who may respond differently to hormonal contraceptives.

Leading many young minds to wonder, “How does he &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; that?” Coins don’t move like water; they’re arguably closer to something like dry sand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:10px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A new paper shows that one lizard may not be able to get through McDuck’s nine cubic acres of money, but it comes a lot closer than anything else we know about so far. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Scincus scincus&lt;/span&gt; is a cute little lizard a few winches long, whose common name, “sandfish,” tells you a lot about its behaviour. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These lizards dive through sand like Unca Scrooge dives through silver dollars. Previously, people had suspected they paddled though the sand using their legs, much like some fish might use their pectoral fins in addition to their trunk. The problem with testing an hypothesis like this is that sand has this irritating property of being opaque – a problem I had significant personal experience with, I might add. I solved it using wires and recording from muscles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sl-pWosq8oI/AAAAAAAACDM/N-Ji7ak9lE8/s1600-h/Scincus_scincus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:134px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sl-pWosq8oI/AAAAAAAACDM/N-Ji7ak9lE8/s200/Scincus_scincus.jpg" border="0" alt="Scincus scincus"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Maladen and colleagues went to high speed X-ray videography. I suspect that they probably spent a long time trying to find a combination of materials with the right combination of transparencies to X-rays, but they did it. And they found that the sandfish might better be described as a sand eel. The swimming that these lizards did (rather fast, about 10 cm per second) was entirely driven by the trunk. The legs were simply held in position and didn’t play a part after the animal got under the sand. There are some fantastic movies of this in the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5938/314/DC1"&gt;supplemental material&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here, the paper looks into the physics of the situation. To be entirely honest, it’s fairly difficult stuff for me. When they write:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is remarkable that η does not change significantly&lt;br&gt;for different φ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to take their word for the remarkable nature of those Greek letters. I am rather hoping that some physics blogger out there can walk through the granular materials math in this paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maladen and company end by noting that they have helped to show how organisms can exploit the alternately solid-like and fluid-like properties of sand to move through it. And this is indeed a substantial achievement, but what if you turn that around? If animals can do this, why haven’t more done so? To the best of my knowledge, no animals besides other lizards swim through sand like sandfish do. And I doubt that this is due to visibility problems; I think it is just that digging organisms are relatively rare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is so much nice stuff in this paper that I &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;might&lt;/span&gt; forgive them for citing a sand crab digging paper from the 1970s instead of &lt;a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/200/4/793"&gt;more recent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003590050037"&gt;more detailed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/201/14/2139"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Reference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Science&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1126%2Fscience.1172490&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Undulatory+Swimming+in+Sand%3A+Subsurface+Locomotion+of+the+Sandfish+Lizard&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=325&amp;amp;rft.issue=5938&amp;amp;rft.spage=314&amp;amp;rft.epage=318&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencemag.org%2Fcgi%2Fcontent%2Ffull%2F325%2F5938%2F314&amp;amp;rft.au=Ryan+D.+Maladen&amp;amp;rft.au=Yang+Ding&amp;amp;rft.au=Chen+Li&amp;amp;rft.au=Daniel+I.+Goldman&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CPhysics%2CBehavioral+Biology%2C+Zoology%2C+Biophysics"&gt;Ryan D.

The conversation, more or less, went like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘&lt;em&gt;Can you dip your hand in the water, maybe play with some lily pads.&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘&lt;em&gt;Huh? Guys, I do marine science, so this pond isn’t related to my work and doesn’t exactly have anything to do with algal blooms in the ocean.&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘&lt;em&gt;Let’s get started… So the blooms, they’re most likely caused by the sun right?&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘&lt;em&gt;I expect it has more to do with a lot of extra nutrients being emptied into the ocean such as runoff from agricultural practices in the region. This provides an excellent environment for algae to bloom which depletes oxygen levels. Eventually it can sometimes lead to what’s called a &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2007/07/31/science-simpson-style/"&gt;dead zone&lt;/a&gt;…’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘&lt;em&gt;Stop, let’s reshoot. We need you to say something about the sun being a factor.  And let’s get you wading into the water. Pretend you’re catching something.&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘&lt;em&gt;Uh, the sun didn’t cause the bloom… and you do realize I’m wearing a dress, right?&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporter&lt;/strong&gt;: ‘&lt;em&gt;You can say your reason too, but name the sun as another ‘theory’. And just look science-y.&lt;/em&gt;‘&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the segment never made it to air. Go figure. &lt;a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1189"&gt;Jorge Cham&lt;/a&gt; sums it up well here:&lt;/p&gt;

Cat experts call one type feline or "modern" partly because they are the ones that did not go extinct.  If you have a pet cat, it's a modern/feine cat.  This also includes the lions, tigers, leopards, etc. The other kind are called "sabercats" because this group includes the saber tooth.  It is generally believed but not at all certain that these two groups of cats are different phylogenetic lineages (but that is an oversimplification).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested for some time that the bite force mechanics for at least the most derived, latest (but, alas, still extinct) sabercats was less than modern cats.  Specifically, this means that when the jaw and the maxilla are brought together by the major muscles that operate this system, the force of the bite is less in the sabercats.  Another thing that has been suggested for some time is that among living (modern) cats, there is a fundamental difference in bite mechanics between the smaller cats (who have round heads) and the larger cats such as lions, who have squarer heads with more snouty faces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px;width:300px"&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/images/lion_skull.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;  Lion skull &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;However, these assertions have not been as well tested because of a) a lack of live examples of sabercats to test the hypotheses on and b) lack of application of three dimensional morophometric modeling, which is the new thing in functional analysis of animal anatomical systems.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent paper, "&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0002807"&gt;Evolution of Skull and Mandible Shape in Cats (Carnivora: Felidae)," by Per Christiansen published in PLoS One&lt;/a&gt; gives us a new perspective on this.  He has applied the morphometrics and come to some interesting conclusions regarding the evolution of bite force mechanics in cats.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty straight forward, so I'm going to bullet point it for you:&lt;br&gt;

For about the last decade I have been reading about hydrogen fuel cell cars as if they were just around the corner. General Motors fatefully decided to pursue hydrogen fuel cell cars rather than developing hybrid or battery technology. In 2003 G.W. Bush announced a 1.2 billion dollar initiative to develop the technology. In California Governor Schwarzenegger decided to build a hydrogen infrastructure in anticipation of the coming fuel cell car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of all this by yet another breathless article, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8154721.stm"&gt;this time on BBC news&lt;/a&gt;, talking up the hydrogen fuel cell car.  This one links development of hydrogen technology to the Apollo missions – a timely connection, given the upcoming 40th anniversary of Apollo 11. This article could have been written 10 years ago (minus a couple of anachronisms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I am not down on the hydrogen fuel cell. It is a nice technology with many advantages. The technology itself is about 150 years old – combine hydrogen and oxygen and you get energy + water. Water is a better byproduct than carbon dioxide. Hydrogen is a reasonably energy dense material. There are already hydrogen fuel cell cars on the road – the technology can work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are major roadblocks to filling our highways with such cars, and it is frustrating when the media or politicians gloss over these problems.  The BBC article does address one of them – where are we going to get all the hydrogen? They point out that currently hydrogen is stripped off of natural gas – a fossil fuel, and doing so releases carbon dioxide, although only about half as much as burning the gas directly. Therefore burning hydrogen from this source is not 100% green but it is still better than burning fossil fuels directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then the article says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to produce an efficient way of extracting hydrogen from water. Imagine that? Cars powered by water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh!  Such cars would not be “powered by water” – they would be powered (ultimately) by whatever energy source was used to “extract” the hydrogen from water. This is a common mistake, often exploited by cranks and cons – water is not a source of energy. It takes energy to separate the hydrogen from the oxygen in water, and you get some (but not all – darn thermodynamics) of that energy back when you recombine hydrogen with oxygen back into water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger issue here is that there is no significant source of free hydrogen on the earth. If we lived in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, maybe we could use hydrogen as an actual energy source. But on earth, hydrogen is not a source of energy – it is only a reservoir for storing energy, but that energy must come from somewhere else. Today most energy stored as hydrogen comes from natural gas (the real source of the energy), which is not a renewable source. In the future we may obtain most of our hydrogen by hydrolyzing water, using solar, wind, nuclear, or some other power source.  This all has to be calculated in when we contemplate a hydrogen economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBC article, however, did not even mention the biggest roadblock to fuel cell cars at present – how to store significant amounts of hydrogen on board a car.  &lt;a href="http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2009/06/researchers-hydrogen-storage-solution-is-no-feather-brained-idea.html"&gt;Free hydrogen gas must be stored under pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and in order to get a decent range would require high pressures – 5,000-10,000 psi. This would still require a large tank to hold 4kg of hydrogen, which would get a range of 200-320 miles. Doable – but not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, compressing the hydrogen to that pressure requires a lot of energy – and that energy has to be calculated into the efficiency of using hydrogen fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are possible solutions in the works. One method is to&lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news157900295.html"&gt; use metal hydride &lt;/a&gt;to absorb the hydrogen, allowing hydrogen to be stored without the need for high pressures.  However, this process creates heat, requiring cooling, or else the refueling process may take up to 40 minutes, which is not practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to use a stack of a material that holds the hydrogen tightly packed together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These approaches are all promising, and one or more of them may pan out. But so far there is no workable solution that can go into production now and produce a hydrogen fuel cell car that is practical enough (in terms of energy efficiency, range, safety, cost, and refueling time) to be widely used today. Further, no one can predict when the technology will be ready. And of course these issues are all separate from the need for a massive hydrogen infrastructure, which has its own technical limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the potential of the hydrogen fuel cell needs to be compared to the potential for battery powered electric cars. A battery powered car has the major advantage of not necessarily requiring a new infrastructure to be practical. This technology is also not ready for prime time, but advances in battery capacity and efficiency are also in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, actually, an exciting competition between these two major approaches to replacing the fossil fuel engine. I honestly don’t know which one will win – both still require significant breakthroughs in order to cross that line where everyone will want one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason I think it is folly for politicians to bet on one technology over the other. In 2003 President Bush bet on hydrogen fuel cells. Now, &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601209&amp;amp;sid=abc.hrgl1DPQ"&gt;President Obama is cutting funding for hydrogen research&lt;/a&gt; for cars and shifting into developing electric vehicles. I know the government has to decide what to fund, but it seems they should be hedging their bets a bit more rather than banking on one winner, and they certainly shouldn’t be trying to rig the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto industry also needs to decide where to spend their research dollars. Honda, Toyota and GM are continuing to invest in hydrogen, but are also developing electric car technology. These decisions may very well determine industry winners and losers in the next decade. We may be heading for a VHS vs Betmax war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the better technology emerge victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

It hasn't exactly been intentional, believe it or not, at least aside from my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/back_to_reality_after_the_amazing_meetin.php"&gt;recap a on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/one_last_tam7_request.php"&gt;request for photos&lt;/a&gt; from those of you who attended. Oddly enough, although I mentioned how proud I was to be part of the Anti-Anti-Vax Panel discussion, where I joined &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/06/help_immunize_las_vegas.php"&gt;Joe Albietz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mikegoudeau.com"&gt;Mike Goudeau&lt;/a&gt; (skeptic, juggler, entertainer, producer, and writer who &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/617-thats-my-kid-too.html"&gt;has an autistic child&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.skepdoc.info"&gt;Harriet Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com"&gt;Derek Bartholomaus&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't really discuss some of the thoughts that the panel's discussion inspired in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the issues that came up over which there was somewhat of a disagreement is exactly how to deal with prominent antivaccine activists, people such as Jenny McCarthy. The majority opinion seemed to be that being too blunt or hurling insults is ineffectual if we want to change their minds. I took a slightly different tack. Yes, we want to persuade people that vaccines are safe and that the claims of the anti-vaccine movement that vaccines are loaded with toxins and cause autism are just not true. Yes, being too free with the insults is not likely to contribute to reaching that end. Yes, we risk being perceived as just as nutty as the anti-vaccine movement we oppose if we become too nasty. On the other hand, I pointed out that there is a profound difference between the two main groups that we need to deal with. First and foremost are those parents who hear the lies of the anti-vaccine movement, are scared, and wonder if there is anything to all this talk of vaccines causing autism. Who can blame them, given the vitriol against vaccines, big pharma, and the government, all coupled with convincing-sounding testimonials about "vaccine injury" that emanate from the anti-vaccine movement? For these parents who have been frightened by this rhetoric, understanding and calm are important. I would never insult such parents for not knowing whether there is anything to the hysterical rhetoric of Generation Rescue, Jenny McCarthy, J. B. Handley, and their ilk. After all, at least two people whom I respect, one of whom is quite likely considerably more scientifically savvy than I am, initially fell for anti-vaccine propaganda and only came back to reason and science after a prolonged flirtation with pseudoscience and quackery. In their cases, great patience can pay great dividends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/enablers_of_the_anti-vaccine_movement.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/enablers_of_the_anti-vaccine_movement.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/l-B9OF1Xx_o" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247839272819"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/snogged_by_an_octopus.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/70abf212318887eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Snogged by an octopus?</title><published>2009-07-17T14:42:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T14:42:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/gqSokQvRzrU/snogged_by_an_octopus.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/snogged_by_an_octopus.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I swear, there's a moment in &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwAqhThd_EQ"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; where the octopus looks like it's trying to get intimate with Steve Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a building on C Street in Washington DC which houses the offices of a fervent evangelical Christian contingent of conservative politicians, who are all, of course, paragons of probity. Except…something funny has been going on. &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_ex_congressman_girlfriend"&gt;Three of them have been publicly humiliated for their inability to keep their pecker in their pants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leisha Pickering said in the lawsuit filed this week that her husband and the woman dated in college, reconnected and began having an affair while he was in Congress and living in a building where several Christian lawmakers reside on C Street near the U.S. Capitol. Chip Pickering is the third Republican with ties to the building at 133 C Street SE to find his personal life making headlines in recent weeks, after Nevada U.S. Sen. John Ensign and South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He cast himself as a defender of decency, particularly on television and the Internet, and was among House members urging then-President George W. Bush to declare 2008 "the National Year of the Bible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another lawmaker who lived at the C Street house, Ensign, a member of the Christian ministry Promise Keepers, stepped down from the Senate Republican leadership in June after admitting he had an affair for much of last year with a woman on his campaign staff.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just days after the story broke, South Carolina Republican Gov. Mark Sanford admitted an affair with a woman in Argentina. He apparently never lived in the house, but has said he turned to "C Street" for counsel and solace while having the affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They're Christians, so it is simply inconceivable that they could have lapsed so far from the strict morality of their faith unless something underhanded is going on: some liberal probably spiked their water supply with Viagra, or sprayed aphrodisiacs into the air ducts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/what_is_in_the_water_on_c_stre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/dfdAFw2b6iw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247838863592"><id gr:original-id="http://www.realclimate.org/?p=606">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/375a53fe74394a32</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Arctic and Antarctic"/><category term="Climate Science"/><title type="html">Sea ice minimum forecasts</title><published>2009-07-17T13:50:10Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T13:50:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/summer-sea-ice-round-up/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.realclimate.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about being a scientist is seeing how unexpected observations can galvanize the community into looking at a problem in a different way than before. A good example of this is the unexpectedly low Arctic sea ice minimum in 2007 and the near-repeat in 2008. What was unexpected was not the long term decline of summer ice (this has long been a robust prediction), but the size of 2007 and 2008 decreases which were much larger than any model had hinted at.  This model-data mismatch raises a number of obvious questions – were the data reliable? are the models missing some key physics? is the comparison being done appropriately? – and some less obvious ones – to what extent is the summer sea ice minimum even predictable? what is the role of pre-conditioning from the previous year vs. the stochastic nature of the weather patterns in any particular summer? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concentration of polar expertise on the last couple of questions has &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0811/full/climate.2008.108.html"&gt;increased enormously&lt;/a&gt; in the last couple of years, and the summer minimum of 2009 will be a good test of some of the ideas that are being discussed. The point is that whether 2009 is or is not a record-setting or near-record setting minimum, the science behind what happens is going to be a lot more interesting than the September headline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the 2007 minimum, a lot of energy went in to discussing what this meant for 2008. Had the Arctic moved into a different regime where such minima would become normal or was this an outlier caused by exceptional weather patterns? Actually this is a bit of false dichotomy since they aren’t exclusive. Exceptional patterns of winds are always going to be the proximate cause of any extreme ice extent, but the regime provides a background upon which those patterns act. For instance, in the paper by &lt;a href="http://seaice.apl.washington.edu/Papers/NghiemEtal2007_MYreduction.pdf"&gt;Nghiem et al&lt;/a&gt;, they showed the influence of wind patterns in moving a lot of thick ice out of the Arctic in early 2007, but also showed that similar patterns had not had the same impact in other years with higher background amounts of ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ‘background’ influence implies that there might indeed be the possibility of forecasting the sea ice minimum a few months ahead of time. And anytime there is the potential to make and test predictions in seasonal forecasting, scientists usually jump at the chance. So it proved for 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some forecasting efforts were organised through the &lt;a href="http://www.arcus.org/search/seaiceoutlook/2008_outlook/report_june.php"&gt;SEARCH group&lt;/a&gt; of polar researchers, and I am aware of at least two informal &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2008/09/sea_ice_declaring_victory_and.php"&gt;betting pools&lt;/a&gt; that were set up. Another group of forecasts can be found from the &lt;a href="http://ccar.colorado.edu/arifs/"&gt;Arctic ice forecasting center&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Colorado. I personally don’t think that the intrinsic worth of a successful prediction of overall sea ice extent or area is that societally relevant – interest in open shipping lanes that might be commercially important need much more fine-grained information for instance – but I think the predictions are interesting for improving understanding of Arctic processes themselves (and hopefully that improved understanding will eventually feed into the models and provide better tests and targets for their simulations). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was particularly interesting about last years forecasts was the vast range of forecasting strategies. Some were just expert guestimates, some people used linear regression on past data, some were simply based on persistence, or persistence of the trend. In more mature forecasting endeavours, the methods tend to be more clustered around one or two proven strategies, but in this case the background work is still underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates made in &lt;a href="http://www.arcus.org/search/seaiceoutlook/2008_outlook/report_june.php"&gt;June 2008&lt;/a&gt; for the September minimum extent showed a wide range – from around 2.9 to 5.6 M km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. One of the lowest estimates assumed that the key criteria was the survivability of first year ice. If one took that to be a fixed percentage based on past behaviour, then because there was so much first year ice around in early 2008, the minimum would be very low  (see also &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2008/2008GL035316.shtml"&gt;Drobot et al, 2008&lt;/a&gt;). This turned out not to be a great approach – much more first year ice survived than was predicted by this method.  The key difference was the much &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/06/north-pole-notes/"&gt;greater amount of first year ice&lt;/a&gt; there was near the pole. Some of the higher values assumed a simple reversion to trend (i.e. extrapolation forward from the long-term trend to 2008). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a couple of the forecasts used physics-based models to make the prediction (for instance, &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2008/2008GL033244.shtml"&gt;Zhang et al, 2008&lt;/a&gt;). This is somewhat surprising until one realises how much work is needed to do this properly. You need real time data to initialise the models, you need to do multiple realisations to average over any sensitivity to the weather, and even then you might not get a range of values that was tight enough to provide useful information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did people do? The actual 2008 September minimum was 4.7 M km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which was close to the median of the June forecasts (4.4 M km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) – and remember that the 2007 minimum was 4.3 M km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the spread was quite wide. The best estimates used both numerical models and statistical predictors (for instance the amount of ice thicker than 1m).  But have these approaches matured this time around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this year’s &lt;a href="http://www.arcus.org/search/seaiceoutlook/2009_outlook/report_june.php"&gt;June outlook&lt;/a&gt;, there is significantly more clustering around the median, and a smaller spread (3.2 to 5.0 M km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) than last year.  As with last year, the lowest forecast is based on a low survivability criteria for first year ice and I expect that this (as with last year) will not pan out – things have changed too much for previous decades’ statistical fits on this metric to be applicable. However, the group with the low forecast have put in a ‘less aggressive’ forecast (4.7 M km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) which is right at the median. That would be equal to last year’s minimum, but not a new record. It would still be well below the &lt;a href="http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/2009/stroeve.png"&gt;sea ice trend expected by the IPCC AR4 models&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.smithpa.demon.co.uk/GRL%20Arctic%20Ice.pdf"&gt;Stroeve et al, 2008&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious excitement related to how this will pan out, but it’s important that the thrill of getting a prediction right doesn’t translate into actually wanting the situation to get worse. Arctic ice cover is not just a number, but rather a metric of a profound and disruptive change in an important ecosystem and element of the climate. While it doesn’t look at all likely, the best outcome would be for all the estimates to be too low.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247837126149"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/blessed_is_san_diego_for_it_sh.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fee6d57b32b69465</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Blessed is San Diego, for it shall be eaten first</title><published>2009-07-17T14:01:59Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T14:01:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/DnSmyE-SdcQ/blessed_is_san_diego_for_it_sh.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/blessed_is_san_diego_for_it_sh.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's a regular event nowadays that the Humboldt squid move up the coast of California, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8155417.stm"&gt;stirring up a little hysteria as they go&lt;/a&gt;.

I made it. I made it and I gave a presentation. There were lots of cool people there, some great presentations, and it was 110 degrees Fahrenheit outside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below are some pictures, some recaps of talks, and some stories. This will not be short. You have been warned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, many good things happened, but I want to get the bitching out of my system all at once right here. This enables me to consolidate the negativity, yell and rant in a hopefully humorous manner, and it enables you, my valued readers, to simply scroll past and read the good stuff on its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Begin Ranting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never made it to the strip. The South Point was a nice hotel, but it was a bit further away than I expected. Like &lt;i&gt;miles&lt;/i&gt; away. Also, the South Point was mercenary as hell; I can go to a fucking Motel 6 and stay for $40 a night and get free wireless internet (I did just that while hunting bigfoot). Any cheapy hotel with a crappy fitness center would let me use it for free. That's part of being a fucking &lt;i&gt;hotel&lt;/i&gt;. So why, at a four-star Vegas hotel and casino with eight restaurants, its own bowling alley, a built-in ten-screen movie theatre, an exhibit hall, an arena where a UFC match was fought that weekend, and a conference hall, was I required to pay $12.95 a day to use the fucking internet and &lt;i&gt;$14.95&lt;/i&gt; a day to use their crappy gym?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went without both; internet was dispensable and I did some push-ups in my room. Fuck those assholes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, there was an old guy at the front desk who was kind of an insufferable prick to me when I checked in. He was looking down his nose the whole time. Fuck him, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mentioned before that I left TAM in a funk due partially to having been there alone. That is true. I'm out of it now, and able to remember it for the awesomeness that it was and not the chemical depression that it felt like at the time, but I've identified partly what the issue was. First off, I just don't like crowds or parties. It's not my thing. Really, though, what I kept coming back to was this idea of social letdown, so to speak, and I'm not the only one; I talked to two other guys who had the same thoughts I did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It goes something like this: we all listened to the podcasts and read the blogs and books and so forth of all those awesome people who were there. Knowing so much about these people, or even, to use the SGU as an example, having their funny, friendly conversations piped directly into your eartubes on a weekly basis, makes them feel almost like friends. Now, you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that they're not your friends; don't think we were deluding ourselves. But at home, you only know it in the abstract. When you meet them in person, as gracious and friendly as they are, you're forced to confront that reality head on: you're just another of the thousand others at the conference who want a picture, a handshake, and a moment of time. It's disappointing, even though it completely stands to reason; as Hume said, reason is the slave of the passions. You &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to be these people's friends, even as your brain screams "Are you a fucking moron?" and when reality knocks you upside the head, it kind of sucks a little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A final rant: Bill Prady, in his keynote, talked about the guys he knew that were the inspirations for his characters on "The Big Bang Theory."  They were all computer-programmers with massive social defects and, as Prady accentuated, a complete lack of judgment about each other. I wrote in my notes "This is not like me." See, there were lots of skeptics there, but there weren't a lot of people I'd give a damn to hang around with. &lt;a href="http://www.twopercentco.com/rants/"&gt;The Two Percent Company&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ninetyfivepercent.blogspot.com/index.html"&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt; have both talked about this before: just because someone shares your opinions on things doesn't mean they're suited to be your friends. There was an odd gestalt at TAM that I rejected, this idea that because we all agree that Bigfoot probably doesn't exist that we should all be friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorry, but I don't function that way. Just because we both agree that EVP is audio pareidolia doesn't mean I want to talk to you or be your friend. Friends are a gut reaction, an organic growth of camaraderie, not an intellectual choice based on a series of shared agreements. There were plenty of people at TAM that I wouldn't hang out with in real life; that they were at TAM makes no difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I met lots of great people, too, but the broader point is just that I don't give a mouth-breathing gomer a pass just because we both self-identify as skeptics. If that makes me some kind of asshole, I really don't care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, I kept coming back to one thought: at this great meetup, this enormous event, a place and time where everyone not only talks of community and coming together but seems to honestly feel and believe what they're saying, I felt more detached, more isolated, while in this 1000-strong crowd of skeptics than I had in a long time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;End Ranting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you read the ranting or skipped it, welcome to the other end and my official report on my experiences at The Amaz!ing Meeting 7. It all started when I landed in Vegas on Thursday morning at about 9AM...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I and some others caught the courtesy shuttle from the airport to the South Point. We talked about some stuff; turns out some of them had been to every TAM. Most of them were disappointed to find out that PZ Myers wouldn't be attending this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After I unpacked stuff, I was greeted by this view out my hotel room window (click to embiggen).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmA-CpW4ZsI/AAAAAAAAApY/S6YhIkffGOU/s1600-h/DSCF0329.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:200px;height:150px" title="Miles and miles of miles and miles. And then some mountains." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmA-CpW4ZsI/AAAAAAAAApY/S6YhIkffGOU/s200/DSCF0329.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I took that picture &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; my next adventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, while unpacking, I realized that I, like an idiot, had left my camera at home. It was on my desk in Indiana, 2000 miles away. Undaunted, I decided to find a shop and buy a new one. I wasn't going to go through TAM with no pictures to bring back and, besides, my other camera was old and crappy anyway. So I walked outside in the 100 degree heat, looked in the direction the airplanes were coming from, and said "I'll walk down there and see what I can find. I might even make it to the strip! After all, I have hours and hours until the reception."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within a mile, I had to stop at a 7/11 to buy a jug of water and some sunscreen. Thanks to liberal and repeated applications of SPF30, I do not look like a cherry popsicle. I don't do melanin too well; me and the sun don't tend to get along. The clerk at the 7/11 was nice enough to tell me I was going in the right direction, and that there was an outlet mall not too much further, and I took off again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within another mile, my bottle of water, which had started off ice cold, had warmed to about body temperature. After it was gone, my mouth was drying at a rapid pace. Almost 0% humidity is very weird when you're from Indiana. I noticed, too, that I wasn't even sweating, fearing heatstroke, I stopped at a pizza joint; I wanted to wait to eat at the buffet at the South Point, but I was quite hungry and somewhat alarmed. Before I even ordered I had started sweating again. Apparently I wasn't dehydrated; it was just so damn hot and dry that the moisture was getting sucked right out of me. I ate a big old slice of pepperoni, guzzled a couple of glasses of Diet Coke, and took off again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, after much arduous walking and fear for the state of the skin on my face (I got sun poisoning once last year and it was awful), I found the outlet mall. I bought a new digital camera: 9 megapixels compared to the 3 of my old one. It was on clearance for $130, so I bought it. (Incidentally, it was probably on clearance because it's freakin' hard to get it to focus correctly, as most of my blurry pictures will attest). The salesman told me which bus to catch, and I waited at the stop, sitting on an overturned grocery cart, for about fifteen minutes, and then had a nice, air-conditioned ride back to the South Point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of air conditioning, "cold" seems warmer in Vegas than it is in Indiana. My room A/C was set to 76, and I prefer at minimum 71. The "cold" setting of my room's faucet and shower were what I could generously call "lukewarm." I think it's a matter of comparative climates; 76 feels great when you're coming in from 110, but not so much when you're coming in from 90. The converse was also true: hot seemed hotter. My faucet and shower went from zero to scalding at an alarming rate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, I eventually ate at the buffet anyway (a single piece of pizza isn't very filling for me) and then made my way up to the reception, where they had free food. I wish someone had told me. I milled around quietly and held up a few walls until someone offered to help me hold up the wall I was on. I can't recall his name, but he was a retired scientist who introduced me to his daughter and her fiance (whose name is the only one I remember, unfortunately: Sam) and we shot the shit for a while. Eventually, Hal Bidlack got on the mic and talked. The Phil Plait got on the mic and talked. Then Randi was introduced to great cheers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He came in in a wheelchair; we were told that while he was happy to take pictures, he couldn't shake anyone's hand. I immediately wondered if he was immunocompromised, and it turns out that was true. He recently had a tumor removed and was scheduled to undergo some chemo after TAM. He said his prognosis is good, though, and he's a tough old codger, so we probably don't have much to worry about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I spent most of the rest of the reception holding up more walls before retiring to bed around 7. I was running on about 4 hours sleep for the previous 48 hours, and I crashed until The Fiancee called me at 6AM to tell me something. "It's 6 in the fucking morning!" I gurgled. "Oh, I thought it was like 2 there." "No! We're 3 hours behind!" "Oh, sorry."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I stayed up anyway. I managed to be one of the first down to the ballroom and got a seat right near the front. It was a great seat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skeptics Guide to the Universe Live Recording&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBJ8oYDAxI/AAAAAAAAApg/WbnIyQRupZk/s1600-h/DSCF0286.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="You&amp;#39;re listening to the Skeptics Guide to the Universe..." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBJ8oYDAxI/AAAAAAAAApg/WbnIyQRupZk/s320/DSCF0286.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Rogues took their seats shortly before 8AM. It was kind of a thrill to hear the whole thing start off right in front of me. I love the SGU and so it was really cool to see it happen live. They talked about a "Haunted Vegas" tour they had gone on the night before. Apparently it was total crap, which was a good thing to know as I was planning on going myself. Evan got to dowse for some ghosts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBKo1UDkGI/AAAAAAAAApo/0BVqxdZn0cE/s1600-h/DSCF0291.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Look, honey, I&amp;#39;m magic!" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBKo1UDkGI/AAAAAAAAApo/0BVqxdZn0cE/s320/DSCF0291.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The rules of the dowsing rods were apparently "If they cross, it's a ghost. If the left one moves inside, it's a ghost. If the right one moves inside, it's a ghost. If the left one moves outside, it's a ghost. If the left one moves outside, it's a ghost. If they both move outside, it's a ghost." Good to know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They even took a picture of some spooooooky ectoplasm...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBLZSfpW6I/AAAAAAAAApw/FQ3HhNGnLUY/s1600-h/DSCF0292.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="It&amp;#39;s a class 4 free-roaming vapor!" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBLZSfpW6I/AAAAAAAAApw/FQ3HhNGnLUY/s320/DSCF0292.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They did not show this to the tour guides, as they had repeatedly made clear that they were "just the tour guides" and not equipped to answer scientific questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They also covered a new prototype for a teeny-tiny robot meant to go inside blood vessels and clear plaque and blockages. It has no motor and is controlled entirely by external magnetic fields. Here's the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6endiAR0u0"&gt;video I took of Bob talking about the not-quite-nanobot&lt;/a&gt;. After that, there was a Science or Fiction which I guessed correctly (I won't spoil it for anyone who wasn't there; it'll be on iTunes soon enough), a "Who's That Noisy," &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvoh7a0zFlQ"&gt;helped along by the audience&lt;/a&gt;, and a Q&amp;amp;A, the questions from which I do not remember, though I think I may have asked one. Maybe not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening Ceremony&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oddly, this happened after the SGU podcast, so I guess technically that wasn't part of TAM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hal Bidlack gave the opening remarks and warned us all about his jokes; apparently it was tradition for people to pretend to hate them, even boo from time to time. I can't talk because I love Hal's bad puns. As a frequent maker of bad puns myself, I couldn't resist. He referred to his jokes as "homeopathic humor," which might have been his best joke of the weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil Plait then took the stage and announced that the JREF had decided to keep the Million Dollar Challenge. This was met with much applause. He said it wouldn't stay the same, but would have to evolve to meet the needs of 21st century woo (those are my words, not his). It will be interesting to see how this plays out. He announced that, as of his speech, there were 1007 attendees at TAM7. That's a whole lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bill Prady's Keynote Speech&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't take too many notes here because, as I've said before, I don't care for "The Big Bang Theory." Prady was a good speaker, even if some of his jokes were sitcom-quality. What bugged me a bit was that he seemed out of place; I'm not sure how much of a skeptic he is, really. He struck me as just a TV writer who had known some skeptical guys at some point and was not giving a lecture to 1000 people who expected something he wasn't. He rubbed some people the wrong way when he claimed that the "Penny" character in his show is not, in fact, a shallow female caricature, because she is "The smartest person on the whole show." I dunno. I've only seen a few episodes. One interesting point was that "The Big Bang Theory," despite its open acceptance of evolution and rejection of some woo, has not received a single angry letter from viewers. Go figure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fintan Steele: Personalized Medicine or Personalized Mysticism?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Steele (who, as someone accurately pointed out to him, had the best porn name at TAM and it was his &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; name) is the director of Scientific Communication at the Broad Institute, which studies genomic medicine (I think I wrote all that down correctly). He was also an ordained Catholic priest and Benedictine monk for eight years, and now he's married to his husband in two different states. Way to stick it to 'em, Dr. Steele.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His talk was about the "new" movement of "personalized medicine" (PM), which purports to use one's unique genome to foretell one's genetic destiny and cure all of one's ills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He gave us the background on the current science of genetic medicine: "haplotypes," blocks of generally similar genetics that he likened to neighborhoods of similar houses, are mapped and associated with different diseases. Haplotypes have allowed doctors to recognize a plethora of new subtypes of different diseases, and their use allows for medication targeting certain genetic subtypes. He named a specific pill for (I believe) lung cancer that is useless in 90% of people but eradicates the cancer in the 10% of people with a certain haplotype.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In essence, there are a number of PM companies out there that are charging people to do a haplotype sequence that they claim will find all of their risky genetics and give them personalized info. Dr. Steele put it simply: it's a lie. The picture is far too complex for such a simplistic view; apparently it's more often not the genes that matter but the protein pathways that are built off of those genes. As an example, a type of blindness and a risk of colon cancer are associated with the same genetics through the same protein pathways. Medicine, he says, is moving toward pathway specialization, not individualization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I quite enjoyed his talk. I had never heard of PM before, but I was glad to know about it before it really hit big. I wished I had found Dr. Steele around TAM to ask about his experience as a monk (he said he was willing to talk at length, just not during his presentation), but I never did. I bet he has some great stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Lancaster&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBNM4weETI/AAAAAAAAAp4/I6N_-os_88U/s1600-h/DSCF0307.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Stop Sylvia Browne now!" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBNM4weETI/AAAAAAAAAp4/I6N_-os_88U/s320/DSCF0307.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We had been told during the reception the night before that Bob Lancaster was recovering well from his stroke last year and was back at TAM. It was a really exciting moment for me even though I don't follow the JREF forums. I've followed Bob's online career from &lt;a href="http://stopkaz.com"&gt;Stop Kaz&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://stopsylvia.com"&gt;Stop Sylvia Browne&lt;/a&gt; and I really value his calm, evenhanded input. He's done such great work that it was a real tragedy when he had to call it quits for a while. He's in a wheelchair and has lost the use of his left side, but he could talk just fine and he told us about his stroke, the history of his skepticism, and how much he appreciated everyone's well wishes. He was a class act all the way around, and he was great to talk to for the few moments I had:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBNopwP4eI/AAAAAAAAAqA/q_h0KFsdAkA/s1600-h/DSCF0397.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I interrupted his magnificent feast." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBNopwP4eI/AAAAAAAAAqA/q_h0KFsdAkA/s320/DSCF0397.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;He talked a good ways into lunch before he finished up hastily, but most of the crowd stayed and listened instead of ducking out to eat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jennifer Oulette: Prime-Time Science&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jennifer Oulette is the author of &lt;i&gt;THhe Physics of the Buffyverse&lt;/i&gt;, a book I simply must pick up. She also runs the new (as of 2008) "cultural crossover" organization &lt;a href="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/"&gt;The Science and Entertainment Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, which pairs TV and movie writers with free, volunteer scientist consultants to make sure that their science is good, and to help show them how good science can &lt;i&gt;open&lt;/i&gt; up the plot and not narrow it down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it's a great organization to have, and I wish I had something to contribute to it. Unfortunately, I do not. At least not yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anti-Anti-Vaccine Panel: Drs. Steve Novella, David Gorski, Joe Albietz, and Harriet Hall, also Michael Goudeau and Derek Bartholomaus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBmXXo2jCI/AAAAAAAAAqo/MN3Q3cBQQBs/s1600-h/DSCF0315.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="That&amp;#39;s a lot of docs." src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBmXXo2jCI/AAAAAAAAAqo/MN3Q3cBQQBs/s320/DSCF0315.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The major theme of this panel was to discuss how best to tackle the anti-vax manufactroversy which, though totally without scientific merit, is having major cultural and medical ramifications. Each person talked a bit by themselves before the panel began. Dr. Gorski (of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere) tackled the claim by McCarthy and friends that they're not anti-vaccine. He says he's a passable public speaker; I thought he did great.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not to downplay Dr. Gorski, but Dr. Albietz stole the show for me. He's a phenomenal speaker and his presentation was full of alarming statistics about the rise of preventable childhood diseases in the wake of the anti-vax movement's popularity. He ended his speech by saying "These children don't have to hurt anymore," and it was a real punch to the gut. He's amazing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drs. Gorski and Albeitz both also graciously agreed to send me their info so we can make the anti-vax section of our Gen Con panel as good as it can be. That one's too important to screw up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the rest of the panel was just spent fielding questions. Michale Goudeau and Derek Bartholomaus didn't say too much; Goudeau is a juggler and a writer for Penn and Teller's Bullshit, and Bartholomaus is the creator of the &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count website&lt;/a&gt;, the widget for which you can see at the bottom of my right sidebar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;James Randi and Jamy Ian Swiss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBnp2EPd5I/AAAAAAAAAqw/tguSgpo6nDI/s1600-h/DSCF0310.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="Randi&amp;#39;s pants are slowly but surely devouring the rest of him." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBnp2EPd5I/AAAAAAAAAqw/tguSgpo6nDI/s320/DSCF0310.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This one was a sit-down talk between the two of them. It focused on Randi's past exploits, and they played a lot of great old video while Randi regaled us with stories of years past. It was entertaining, but I didn't write down anything specific that leaped out at me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Nickell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I missed the beginning of Dr. Nickell's presentation, which is disappointing because I really wanted to hear it all. I like Nickell's calm, confident intellectualism. He's done a lot for skepticism, and I really respect him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, his talk was about bigfoot and UFOs as mythology. He talked about the forms of the mythology and showed a bunch of pictures from a Bigfoot hunt he went on in the Pacific Northwest. Bigfoot is used to shore up weak local economies by bringing in tourists; he's interpreted by artists in 2d and 3d media. More than anything, though, Dr. Nickell emphasized Bigfoot's role in modern myth: he represents our fascination with the lost primitive, with the untouched, pristine wilderness, and with our own past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other side are UFOs. Aliens in modern pop culture are a result of years of convergence on a mythological mean. He showed a slide of &lt;a href="http://www.brights.nl/weblog/images/alientimeline.jpg"&gt;a timeline he did of the history of alien portrayals throughout the 20th century an into the present&lt;/a&gt;. The forms vary but the modern traits are seen very far back. Aliens, he posited, represent our thoughts and dreams about our future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing I enjoyed most about his speech, I think, was how his words echoed some things I've been thinking myself for a long time. These ideas of cryptids and aliens and ghosts live in the cultural consciousness. Seemingly anomalous events are interpreted based on the myths of the moment. Someone, somewhere gives form to an out-of-the-ordinary experience, and from then on, people see that form in their own lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The SGU Dinner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;There wasn't too much downtime between the last presentation and the Skeptics Guide to the Universe dinner, for which I had paid $55. The food was tasty, I sat at a table with some nice folks (one of whom is from Ft. Wayne, Indiana and is with me in planning an Indy Skepticamp), and I was recruited to aid in a blanket toss because, and I quote "You look pretty buff." That was a freakin' ego boost. Rebecca and Evan sat at our table and shot the shit for a while:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBjmcJEG0I/AAAAAAAAAqI/rPdPaoRsVr4/s1600-h/DSCF0331.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I think she was already a bit tipsy." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBjmcJEG0I/AAAAAAAAAqI/rPdPaoRsVr4/s320/DSCF0331.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I wandered around for a while and before long, people began aggregating by the microphone on the far end of the room and pictures were taken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBkm6TOlEI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/di6OV2VoVdo/s1600-h/DSCF0335.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="People would just jump in and their friends would take pictures." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBkm6TOlEI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/di6OV2VoVdo/s320/DSCF0335.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I got a picture with the brothers Novella and, later on in the hallway, with Rebecca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBlHw4JC3I/AAAAAAAAAqY/Mul7RdZJuxw/s1600-h/DSCF0337.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="I felt really tall here." src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBlHw4JC3I/AAAAAAAAAqY/Mul7RdZJuxw/s320/DSCF0337.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SmBlISDnARI/AAAAAAAAAqg/8FfG_eRBoMc/s1600-h/DSCF0343.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" title="This was the second picture.

Nobody, apparently, was interested, so I retired to my room and went to sleep. After all, I had to get up early for Saturday's live SGU and the premiere of Jay's Secret Project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll cover Saturday and Sunday as soon as I can.

&lt;p&gt;While there are many taxonomies of alternative medicines, one thing almost all alternative therapies have in common is they are originally the de novo discovery of one lone individual.  Working outside of the mainstream, they are the gadflies who see farther because  those around them are midgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanneman conceives of  homeopathy, the treatment of all disease.&lt;br&gt;
Palmer conceives the cause of all disease and its treatment in chiropractic&lt;br&gt;
Mikao Usui, while having a mid-life crisis, conceives Reiki.&lt;br&gt;
Virgin births all. These pioneers boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have been less acclaimed after seeking out new life. An example is  Virginia Livingston, MD, the discoverer of the cause of all cancer (1).  She discovered a bacterium, the cause of cancer,  she called &lt;em&gt;Progenitor cryptocides,&lt;/em&gt; which, unfortunately only she could grow.  Her therapies include  an autogenous ‘vaccine” made from your own urine, which will probably preclude widespread use even in alternative therapies circles.  I wonder if Jenny would object to vaccines if there were naturally derived from the patients urine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovering a new form of pathogenic microbiology that no one else can see or grow is not uncommon, since people seem to be unable to recognise artifact on slides, be it Oscillococcinum being seen by Joseph Roy 200 years ago or Virginia Livingston in the 1960’s.  Sometimes I regret the discovery of &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; as a cause of gastritis as it gives the alternative microbiologists a medical Galileo to point at.   &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; is used as an example, erroneously, of a bacteria causing disease that was laughed at by the medical establishment (Parenthetically, as my flawed memory has it, while I was an Infectious Disease Fellow the data for &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt; came trickling in.  I remember discussing the papers with one of my attendings who was an expert in GI infections.  We all thought is was an interesting hypothesis and waited further data with interest.  I cannot remember anyone dismissing the idea out of hand with derisive laughter.  But then, I remain convinced that infections are the cause of all disease, at least the diseases that matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter from a reader lead me another lone reseacher who has discovered the cause and treatment of many, if not all,  diseases. So may I introduce to you,  Trevor Marshall, the developer of the Marshall Protocol.  (As I have said many time, I want something in medicine named after me, and it is not the glove breaking during an exam. “Damn, I just had a Crislip.  I need to go and clean my nails.”  If Swan or Groshong can get some silly little catheter named after them, well, I should be good for some eponym).  You have not heard of Trevor Marshall?  Often the fate of originality is to languish in obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Marshall Protocol has all the characteristics of modern alternative therapy:  a single discoverer, a hitherto undiscovered biology, an unproven therapeutic intervention and one of the most aggravating issues in alternative medicines:  Taking a scientific truth the size of a molehill and transmogrifying it into a Cascade Range of exaggerated disease etiology and treatment.  Unlike most alternaive proponents, however, as best as I can tell Dr Marshall does not seem to be in the business of making a business from  his discovery, although he does have patent applications for his protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Marshall is a PhD in electrical engineering and was diagnosed years ago with sarcoidosis. It was his diagnosis with what is often a fatal disease that lead to his insights into diseases.  One cannot help but think of Linus Pauling and his vitamin C epiphany after almost dying of kidney failure.  Staring into the eyes of your own mortality almost always leads to personal epiphanies.  Most people learn to appreciate the little things in life they had hitherto ignored. Others aim higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcoid is an interesting disease whose etiology is unknown but is characterized by non-caseating granulomas.  Granulomas are an immunologic response to infections, often fungal or mycobacterial, and I will not be surprised if some day an infectious cause of sarcoid is discovered.  Same, I will bet, for Crohns, another disease of uncertain origin that has granulomas.  For as of today, no definite infection has been found to cause sarcoid or Crohns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Marshall was intrigued by studies that demonstrated Rickettsia DNA in two patients with sarcoid and by the fact that his disease was worsened by sunlight. He then developed an hypothesis, unproven, but interesting, as to the cause of many chronic illnesses. And from there he developed a protocol to treat diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall suggests that autoimmune diseases are due to a correctable defect in innate immunity from a dysregulation of vitamin D. This immunologic defect allows  L-form (cell wall deficient) bacteria, to proliferate.  In an interview he points to  ‘bacteria” on &lt;a href="http://www.autoimmunityresearch.org/wirostko-fig3.jpg)"&gt;electron micrographs&lt;/a&gt; that are living happily in white cells.  How does he know they are bacteria 100 times smaller than usual?  Can he grow them? No.  It appears that they are bacteria because, well, they look like bacteria.  To him. Not to me. But underlying all of the diseases treated by the Marshall protoall are due to colonies of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“intraphagocytic, metagenomic microbiota… The term intraphagocytic refers to the fact that these bacteria have developed the ability to remain alive and proliferate undetected inside the cytoplasm of the cells they infect. These cells include macrophages, the very cells of the immune system that the body uses to kill invading pathogens…The term metagenomic indicates that there is a tremendous number of different species of these chronic bacterial forms. Finally, the term microbiota refers to the fact that these bacteria are also hypothesized to sustain themselves by grouping into communities called biofilms. The bacteria inside a biofilm produce a protective matrix that allows them to more effectively evade the immune system and develop resistance to antibiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is nice that at least they use the term hypothesis, although redundant, should also include the adjectives untested and unproven.&lt;br&gt;
He refers to these infections as TH-1 infections, “after T-helper Type 1 (Th1) immune response. The T-helper Type 1 (Th1) immune response is usually defined as one which generates significant quantities of the cytokine Interferon-gamma (3).”  The Th1  is the humoral immune system, Th2 is the B cell, or antibody wing of the immune system.  Many infections are attacked with both Th1 and Th2 and to call pathogens Th1 is false dichotomy and a term only used by Dr. Marshall et. al.  It does sound nice and sciency, although no one in the closed minded field of infectious diseases has ever used the term Th-1 infections around me that I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These bacteria then interfere with the vitamin D receptor to shut down the immunologic modulation of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent molecular modeling research (which has been confirmed by a large amount of clinical data) has shown that levels of 25-D over 20 ng/ml can bind and inactivate the VDR, which subsequently shuts down the innate immune system. Certain species of bacteria also produce substances that can bind and inactivate the VDR in a manner similar to 25-D. Consequently, people who are infected with the Th1 pathogens and consuming vitamin D are no longer able to produce the AMPs or turn on the innate immune response. This allows their bacteria to proliferate and spread. (5)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria and Vitamin D act together to shut down the immune system and the bacteria take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is an important immunomodulator and a pubmed search will reveal an a growing and interesting literature that vitamin D deficiency, increases, note &lt;strong&gt;increases&lt;/strong&gt;, the risk of a variety of infections.  There is a concomitant SCAM literature to suggest that all you need to treat influenza and other infections is to increase your vitamin D intake.  As found in the Weekly World er, I mean, the Natural News, taking vitamin D helps treat or prevents cancer, stroke, psoriasis, schizophrenia,  and depression (8). Who are you gonna believe? One (or both) of these approaches should be wrong, although I suppose that influenza is a Th-2 pathogen and as such doesn’t count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this untested hypothesis, there is a therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Kill the bacteria with long term (years) of antibiotics &lt;strike&gt;like doxycycline&lt;/strike&gt; like minocycline. This is to eradicate the supposed L forms found in the granuloma. Unfortunately, the L forms, or even pathogens,  have not yet been discovered in most of the diseases treated by the Marshall Protocol.  And when bacteria have been found in rheumatoid arthritis or sarcoidosis, the studies have not been replicated, which is most annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Use of angiotensin receptor antagonists.  They recommend olmesartan which is said to be able able to bind to and activate the vitamin d receptor and block vitamin D  effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has never been shown to occur either in the test tube or in humans or animals.  The data to support this, and please read it slowly so it sinks in, is based on a computer model (3). Computer simulations, not experiments.  As the FDA has said “The FDA-approved prescribing information for Valsartan states “Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation (3).”  Again, as a closed minded arrogant tool of the medical industrial complex, I worry about going straight from computer models to treating patients. Wouldn’t do it with an airplane, wouldn’t do it with a medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Avoid vitamin D.  This is interesting.  Vitamin D does more than build strong bones and has wide ranging effects on immune regulation.  Given the growing literature demonstrating the a deficiency of vitamin D increases risks for a variety of infections, from viral to tuberculosis, I am uncertain of the wisdom of suggesting this intervention without supporting clinical trials.  I would worry more if there is a history of osteoporosis in the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some collagen vascular diseases, like lupus, worsen as vitamin d levels decline. Multiple sclerosis is improved with vitamin D. A recent review suggests “Epidemiological evidence indicates a significant association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased incidence of several autoimmune diseases (4).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarcoid has dysregulation of vitamin D with increased levels in the blood, the vitamin D being made in the granulomas. Maybe avoiding vitamin D in sarcoid is not completely without reason, but I would not extrapolate to other diseases that have nothing in common except for unproven Th-1 pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking the problem for patients, especially in the northern latitudes, are diseases made worse by vitamin D deficiencies.&lt;br&gt;
What diseases are treated with this protocol?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Th1 inflammatory diseases and symptoms currently being treated with the Marshall Protocol include:&lt;br&gt;
ALS (Lou Gehrig’s), Ankylosing Spondylitis, Asperger’s, Back pain, Barrett’s esophagus, Bipolar disorder, Candidiasis, Cardiac Arrythmia, Celiac disease, CFS / CFIDS / ME, Chronic Lyme/Borreliosis, Crohn’s Disease, Diabetes insipidus, Diabetes type I, Diabetes type II, Dementia, Depression, Epilepsy, FM (Fibromyalgia), Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), Interstitial cystitis (IC), Inflammatory bowel disease, Irritable bowel syndrome, Kidney stones, Lofgren’s syndrome, Lupus In ‘Overlap’ With Other Connective Tissue Diseases, Mania, MCS (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity), Migraine headache, Morgellon’s, Multiple Sclerosis, Myasthenia gravis, Neuropathy, OCD(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), Osteoarthritis, Panic attacks, Parkinsons, Pervasive Developmental Disorders- Not Otherwise Specified, POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), Prostatitis, Psoriasis, Psoriatic arthritis, Raynaud’s syndrome/phenomenon, Reactive Arthritis (Reiter Syndrome), Restless leg syndrome, RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy), Rheumatoid Arthritis, Sarcoidosis, Scleroderma, Sinusitis, Seasonal affective disease (SAD), Sjogren’s, Ulcerative colitis, Uveitis, Vertigo , Other Th1 diseases which should respond to the Marshall Protocol:  Alzheimer’s, Anorexia Nervosa, Bulbous pemphigus, Cystic fibrosis, Macular degeneration, Polymyalgia rhuematica, Polymyositis, Schizophrenia (5)”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a good list.  Back pain, mania, osteoarthritis, vertigo, and kidney stones all have the same pathogenesis and treatment.  I went to medical school for what? And it is good to see a treatment for Morgellon’s.&lt;br&gt;
And there may be no end to diseases that could fall to the Marshall protocoll:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I disagree that Th1 patients each have different illnesses. I have seen no data to confirm this. Everything I see is that all the Th1 diagnoses spring from a common pathogenesis, a special adaptation of intra-phagocytic bacteria which allows them to evade phagocytosis by stimulating a Th1 response in the parasitized phagocytes.&lt;br&gt;
“I personally believe that ALL the Th1 diseases result from the same bacterial pathogenesis. This belief is grounded in my understanding of how the bacteria directly drive the phagocytic biochemistry, causing the Th1 cytokine release.&lt;br&gt;
“IMO, it is important for everybody to stop thinking about these Th1 syndromes as being separate and discrete diagnoses. IMO, all Th1 illness has a common pathogenesis, only the mix of symptoms varies from person to person, depending on bacterial species present, and the sequence of infection/coinfection.&lt;br&gt;
“We are not all different. &lt;strong&gt;Th1 disease overrides ALL the issues of diet, location, exposure to pathogens, etc&lt;/strong&gt;. (My bold) We can see that by standing back and looking at ALL the folks on the Marshall Protocol. There are more similarities than differences, and it does not help recovery to focus on perceived differences. (7)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do I make of the Marshall Protocal?&lt;br&gt;
Unproven. Based of hypothesis that are almost certainly not true. Potentially harmful if it induces side effects from unneeded antibiotic uses or, more worrisome,  from vitamin deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

I suspect it has). Amy has always struck me as the kind of chick to get things done, which happens to be my favorite kind of chick to bring on board. When I met her, I knew immediately that she was even awesomer than I had imagined. She was funny, sweet, smart, and working hard at the Surlyramics/Skepchick table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked how she might feel about coming on board Skepchick to add some more of the artsy side of critical thinking, she pretty much flipped out in the best way possible and excitedly started telling me about the tons of other ideas she had. I immidiately decided to marry her on stage at TAM 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="A &amp;amp; Amy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2562/3721414979_546f50380c_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"&gt;That night was the Skepchick party. In a packed villa, I made the announcement: “I’ve decided to add a new Skepchick to the team, and I haven’t bothered to tell the other Skepchicks.” (Excited murmur) “But I know you’ll all love her. And I’m pretty sure many people here already know who she is, since you’re already wearing her jewelry.” (Screams, cheers, thunderous applause, hugs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy is already hard at work being awesome, developing some of her many ideas. She’ll be posting an intro soon, and then getting down to Skepchick business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the team, Amy!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247832462078"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_16_photoperiodi_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/97c8ffef67d51df3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">Clock Tutorial #16:  Photoperiodism - Models and Experimental Approaches</title><published>2009-07-17T11:47:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T11:47:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/6fLe8kent0k/clock_tutorial_16_photoperiodi_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_16_photoperiodi_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/08/photoperiodism-models-and-experimental.html" title="Clock Tutorial #16:  Photoperiodism - Models and Experimental Approaches"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clock Tutorial #16:  Photoperiodism - Models and Experimental Approaches" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This post (written on August 13, 2005) describes the basic theory behind photoperiodism and some experimental protocols developed to test the theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_16_photoperiodi_3.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_16_photoperiodi_3.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/6fLe8kent0k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247832429377"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13658">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc7f19ea0116f859</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Dating"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">How to Meet, Date, and Woo Atheist Women</title><published>2009-07-17T11:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T11:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/17/how-to-win-over-atheist-women/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I always hear people talking about where they can meet other atheists for dating/mating purposes.  So I put the question out to several atheist lady-friends and the Twitter/Facebook worlds: &lt;strong&gt;What do the rest of us need to know in order to woo female atheists?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response was overwhelming.  I’ve compiled the advice below from what they said (along with my own thoughts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1: Know where to look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not at her boobs (see Step 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meetings of local or campus atheist groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certain college classes: Political science, Geology, Biology, Philosophy, etc. (Classes involving small group discussions are a plus.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sci-fi conventions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee Shops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used bookstores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atheist &lt;a href="http://forum.friendlyatheist.com/"&gt;message boards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook — It’s possible to do a direct search in your network for atheists, agnostics, humanists, and Pastafarians (seriously).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/hemantmehta"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — You can search for the term “atheist” or connect with friends of known atheists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YouTube — If you search for “atheist,” you’ll find that several awesome ladies post videos on there.  Does one live near you?  Profess your love.  Know that every other person is doing the same thing and you may be rejected or ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blogosphere — To the women who blog, we all salute you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Catholic high schools (If you’re over 18, please ignore this one).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2: Try the dating websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://personals.theonion.com/"&gt;Salon/Nerve/Onion&lt;/a&gt; = Great for atheists.  Those sites are all part of the same network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.okcupid.com"&gt;OKCupid&lt;/a&gt; = Good for atheists.  And free!  (How could you not love a site that has a section called “stalkers”?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://match.com"&gt;Match&lt;/a&gt; = Decent for atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eharmony.com/"&gt;eHarmony&lt;/a&gt; = &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2007/06/16/eharmony-saying-no-to-atheists/"&gt;Not so good&lt;/a&gt; for atheists.  The founder is a conservative Christian and &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-05-18-eharmony_x.htm"&gt;that doesn’t help us&lt;/a&gt;.  Plus, those commercials are so damn annoying…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://craigslist.org/"&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt; = Would you like some gonorrhea to go with that herpes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, Craigslist is fine… but your best bet is to post your own ad — saying a little bit about yourself and the type of person you’re looking for — and then learn to weed out the crazies.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3: Be social.  But don’t pounce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to atheist gatherings, definitely talk to the ladies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t that no one talks to the women; the problem is that &lt;em&gt;way too many people&lt;/em&gt; talk to the women… all at once… the moment they step into the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And most of the guys are creepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be one of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look presentable.  Put your glasses on straight.  Suck in the gut.  Shower.  Floss.  Cologne is good when measured in drops.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t bring up your collection of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; memorabilia.  Save that for the second date.  (Or never… unless she’s into them, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t stare at her boobs.  Save that for the third date.  (Or just be subtle.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#4: Looking like this scores you bonus points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Hugh_Laurie_HouseMD.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Hugh_Laurie_HouseMD.jpg" alt="Hugh_Laurie_HouseMD" title="Hugh_Laurie_HouseMD" width="270" height="256"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Tyson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Tyson.jpg" alt="Tyson" title="Neil deGrasse Tyson" width="155" height="196"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need surgery to make the transformation happen, go for it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#5: Have something to talk about other than atheism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, there are plenty of other topics worth discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all love meeting someone else who feels the same way about God and astrology and Tom Cruise.  But once that’s understood, it’s time to move on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also not pleasant to hear someone trashing religious people all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read books, be up-to-date on current events, know how to tell a good story, know something about sports (better yet, play one), listen to music that isn’t on the radio, watch movies that play in only a handful of theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Flying Spaghetti Monster comes up in conversation, don’t attempt a joke about what you do with your noodly appendage.  It will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing up &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/em&gt; scores you bonus points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#6: When not at an atheist gathering, it helps to carry around a New Atheist book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re sitting in an airport or a coffee shop, just break out that copy of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGod-Delusion-Richard-Dawkins%2Fdp%2F0618918248%2F&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  You don’t have to be reading it.  Just &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like you’re reading it.  The atheist ladies will flock to you.  That book is like a Bat signal for the godless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helps to just be public about your atheism.  How will the ladies find you if you’re closeted?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fact: If you have a Darwin Fish on your car, or a &lt;a href="http://outcampaign.org/"&gt;Scarlet A&lt;/a&gt; sticker on your computer/&lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;q=manpurse&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;ei=3ptbSrh9jP4z8JSYQw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;amp;ct=title&amp;amp;resnum=4"&gt;manpurse&lt;/a&gt; (murse?), atheist ladies will chase after you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#7: It may be useful to accurately gauge the woman’s degree of atheism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it turns out you and she are similarly secular, you are one step ahead of the game.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find that out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin by tossing around words like “secular” and “agnostic” and check out her reaction.  If she’s already freaked out, run away.  If she seems responsive, this is good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then try throwing out a “Pastafarian” or “Humanist.”  If she stares at you blankly, run away.  If she laughs or nods approvingly, you’re on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then mention “&lt;strong&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/strong&gt;.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If her reaction is like this…  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/freaked_out.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/freaked_out.jpg" alt="freaked_out" title="freaked_out" width="200" height="235"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/South-Park-Eric-Cartman.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/South-Park-Eric-Cartman.jpg" alt="South-Park-Eric-Cartman" title="South-Park-Eric-Cartman" width="345" height="259"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… she may be the one for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either one works.  Because it’s all about name recognition and there is no in-between with PZ &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#8: Just because she is an atheist, do not assume you know what she thinks about everything else&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all atheist women are swingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them may be looking for a long-term relationship.  Some may not want to ever get married.  Some may not be pro-choice or vote Democrat.  Some may actually like certain aspects of religion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may want to have babies for non-digesting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to discover all these things on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#9: Do not automatically discount a non-atheist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very possibly that you meet someone you like who is a very religious person.  Or just moderately theistic.  Or Jewish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have fun and get along, maybe religion is a barrier you can overlook at first.  Maybe she’s an atheist who hasn’t realized it yet.  Maybe she’s someone who has never questioned her faith before but is interested in what you have to say.  And, yes, maybe it’ll be a barrier you can’t overcome.  You never know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story: You don’t automatically have to set your dating website search filters on “atheist” only.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#10: Be ready to have a duel with the atheist who is already dating her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you meet the woman of your dreams, you’ll find out quickly that she’s already seeing somebody.  In this case, you must be prepared to do battle.  I suggest becoming a fencing or jousting expert.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, get out there and breed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I missed anything important, please let me know.  Thanks to everyone who offered their thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t watch much TV–and so I &lt;em&gt;REALLY&lt;/em&gt; had no plans to watch &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_a_Celebrity%E2%80%A6Get_Me_Out_of_Here!#American_series"&gt;“I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!”&lt;/a&gt; (although if Rob Blagojevich had been on, that might have been worth it, just to see what would happen to his hair.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ecorazzi.com/2009/06/23/stephen-baldwin-quits-nbc-show-after-botfly-larvae-get-under-his-skin/"&gt;Steven Baldwin Quits Celebrity Show after Botflies get Under His Skin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Baldwin said: “I suffered in the first eight days of production, while in the jungle, over 125 insect bites on my body… kind of all over and two of them, much to my surprise, became quite lumpy initially.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Within about 72 hours they were these half dollar-sized lumps under my skin that were probably about an inch thick….. I did get to take some time with the medic who explained that in his opinion at that point he didn’t think that it was the ‘implantation of insect larvae into my flesh’, but that – oh gosh – that’s what it could be… So they tested these things and sure enough, Stevie B was ‘pregnant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And therein lies perhaps the most interesting thing you’ve ever read about Stephen Baldwin.’”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2007/07/19/bot-flies/"&gt;I’ve covered Bot Flies before&lt;/a&gt; here at the Bug Blog, &lt;img title="NEJM Botflies!" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2007/07/botfly.gif?w=384&amp;amp;h=157" alt="" width="384" height="157"&gt;and generally they are uncomfortable, but not usually very dangerous. In one of the best opening sentences of a scholarly paper ever, &lt;a href="http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.en.27.010182.001525"&gt;Paul Catts wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Maggots of cuterebrid bot flies are conspicuous, repulsive, and frequently encountered cutaneous parasites of Mammals in the New World.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Yep, that’s about right. The primate bot fly belongs to the Genus &lt;em&gt;Dermatobia&lt;/em&gt;, in the fly Family &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oestridae"&gt;Oestridae&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a title="many great links and info" href="http://botfly.ifas.ufl.edu/links/links1.htm"&gt;family of flies&lt;/a&gt; are also known as warble flies, and infest all manner of mammals, including horses, cats, and mice.&lt;/div&gt;

I have been making the rounds of visiting schools for autistic children. New Jersey has quite a few, with many using the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) as their teaching methodology, having one-to-one teacher-to-student ratios, and being very small (no more than 30 students, if that). I've been having feelings of déja vu while at the Open Houses---it was 8 or 9 years ago that I visited many of these schools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the parents I've met have children of around 3 or so years which is the age most children are accepted into the schools. Charlie being a grand old age of 12, it's not been too hard to get the feeling that he's the odd man/boy out. For a few moments of each visit, I have been asking myself, why am I bothering---isn't this some futile effort on my part that's only going to result in "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/back_on_the_road_to_find_a_school"&gt;no, we have no room for your child&lt;/a&gt;" delivered in a short form letter? I try to imagine how I as the parent of a much younger Charlie would have felt to hear another parent say what I have been saying: "My son is 12 and he is in a public school autism program and it does have the same student-to-staff ratio as this private school etc. etc." Would I have been thinking, so she did all that and her son has all that and he still has huge challenges and no way he's getting into this school to help him through them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, in listening to the school directors' presentations, I said to myself, &lt;em&gt;now wait a moment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going over the history of their schools and their teaching methods and philosophy, the school directors noted how their teaching is not only about academic subjects and teaching communication skills, self-help skills, and the like. They also noted that they work on teaching children to do things "in the community" such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• haircuts (&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/at-the-barber-shop/"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt; I thought: Jim taught Charlie to get his hair buzzed at the local barbershop and Charlie enjoys it)&lt;br&gt;
• dentist and doctor visits (&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/thoughts-while-watching-charlie-at-the-dentist/"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/doctor_day"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt;--Charlie gets his teeth cleaned sitting in the dentist chair, patiently waits in the waiting and examination rooms, gets his shots and gets prodded by the stethoscope and has his ears checked; got through an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/thats_ten_years_triumph_in_an_audiology_booth"&gt;audiology test&lt;/a&gt; and also blood testing to the tune of 12 vials) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• bike riding (totally &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/we_ride_bikes_together"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt;: Jim and Charlie have been averaging two long bike rides on these summer days; I saw a boy on a little bike outfitted with training wheels such as Charlie used to have as I crossed the parking lot at one of the schools I visited)&lt;br&gt;
• grocery shopping and not only getting what Charlie wants (&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/thoughts-on-recovery-from-autism-while-grocery-shopping/"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
• eating in restaurants (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diner_date"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt;; Charlie would eat out every night if he could)&lt;br&gt;
• airplanes (&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_on_airplane_accommodations"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt;, though lately Charlie, while ok with the airplane travel, has not been so ok about being in new places lately---something more to work on)&lt;br&gt;
• playing musical instruments including piano and cello (&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/innovative-piano-a-tale-of-two-music-books/"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/teaching-strategy-16-first-lessons-in-piano-and-cello/"&gt;check&lt;/a&gt;; currently we are on hiatus with this due to Charlie's extreme sound sensitivity)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we've been able to discuss teaching Charlie to do these things with various consultants over the years, and have had therapists accompany us in some situations (like at the dentist for awhile), Jim and I have mostly worked on teaching Charlie these things on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as I listened to the question and answers of other parents and walked around the schools, touring the classrooms, I also thought about how, without having Charlie in such a school for allt hese years, he's learned quite a bit. Certainly when he was 3 years old, haircuts, the dentist, getting his blood drawn, supermarkets, airplane travel, playing "Happy Birthday" on the piano, riding a bike---the thought of him do all of these things would have seemed like a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as one of the school directors said, they don't produce miracles at the schools. The students work hard, the teachers work hard, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life_in_the_slow_lane"&gt;step by step by step&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I wish I had said to some of those parents of much younger children is: Sure, it would be great if your child got a placement at this school. But in the meantime you must deal with what is in front of you---your child---and learn and work at teaching him yourself and &lt;i&gt;you can do more than you know yourself&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sure, it would be great if Charlie could get a placement in one of those schools. In the meantime, we've got our wits and our years of training and teaching him. A little DIY attitude doesn't hurt and---like Charlie on a recent 12-mile bike ride---could go farther than anyone might think.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247814512174"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3830">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f078f846d5b5f87f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="religion"/><category term="abstinence"/><category term="apple"/><category term="iPhone"/><category term="purity ring"/><title type="html">The new Apple iVirgin – man, they have an app for everything</title><published>2009-07-17T06:42:36Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T06:42:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/the-new-apple-ivirgin-man-they-have-an-app-for-everything/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://content.ytmnd.com/content/7/4/e/74eac79373c07ea39e460a825983a5b1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://content.ytmnd.com/content/7/4/e/74eac79373c07ea39e460a825983a5b1.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="178"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Okay, this is a short one, but I couldn’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jul/14/iphone-purity-pledge-apple"&gt;The iPhone now has a “purity ring” application&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For just 59p, consumers can download an application that allows them to take a purity pledge and then display a silver ring on their phone to prove their commitment to abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess Apple are now in the business of endorsing underaged, unprotected sex since that is the proven outcome of this abstinence-only crap and that’s the great legecy of the purity ring movement. It actually works in reverse because those wearing it greatly increase their likelihood of having unprotected sex within the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good job, Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Doubleday wouldn’t be the first to steal James Randi’s challenge idea and corrupt it by deliberately rigging it with pseudoscience to make it unwinnable. Evolution denialist Ray Comfort has his own $10,000 challenge for anyone who can present a single “genuine living transitional form”. But of course, while there are thousands of transitional fossils, conveniently, none of them are good enough for Comfort’s challenge, which defines a transitional form as. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .a lizard that produced a bird, or a dog that produced kittens, or a sheep that produced a chicken, or even as Archaeopteryx–a dinosaur that produced a bird&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since that’s not what a transitional form is, the challenge is impossible to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to Jock Doubleday. So what is his great challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;. . .$75,000.00 to the first medical doctor or pharmaceutical company &lt;span&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; who publicly drinks a mixture of standard vaccine additives ingredients in the same amount as a six-year-old child is recommended to receive under the year-2005 guidelines of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (In the event that thimerosal has recently been removed from a particular vaccine, the thimerosal-containing version of that vaccine will be used.)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;The mixture will be body weight calibrated.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And according to Doubleday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;14 doctors, or persons claiming to be doctors, have contacted me about publicly drinking the vaccine additives mixture. None have followed through.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s wrong with the challenge (besides of course that if he’s trying to show doctors are afraid of “the toxins” in vaccines, this challenge doesn’t actually demonstrate that because it demands an action that’s not even close to being the same thing as receiving an inoculation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well first off, &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=473"&gt;according to Autism Blog&lt;/a&gt;, in order to even begin the challenge, one is required to jump through tons of hoops by undergoing lots of unnecessary and totally irrelevant evaluations and filling out an obscene amount of paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the little detail that this “challenge” lacks anything resembling appropriate scientific protocols and illustrates a total lack of scientific understanding. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8699562?dopt=Abstract"&gt;And a REAL study was already done in 1996 that Doubleday’s supposed refutes point&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention that &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/gentlebirth.htm"&gt;his challenge has been accepted&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/464"&gt;numerous occasions&lt;/a&gt; but that he refused to test them for inexplicable reasons? What is Doubleday afraid of anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a challenge for Doubleday. If he can prove that thimerosal causes autism, he should enter the James Randi Educational Foundation’s Million Dollar Challenge. Although the JREF challenge primarily calls for paranormal challenges, they do also allow medical claims to be tested as well. And given the enormous evidence against Doubleday’s position I’m sure they’d consider accepting Doubleday at least into their priliminary challenge. Because unlike Doubleday’s bogus challenge, the JREF challenge does really accept challengers, tests them fairly and under properly controlled scientific conditions, and as this weekend proved, &lt;a href="http://phyzblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/tam7-million-dollar-challenge-connie.html"&gt;they’re willing to conduct the entire test in front of a live audience of 1000 people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ll ask again, what are you afraid of, Jock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move aside John Edward. Someone deserves to be awarded greatest douche in the universe far more than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

This vessel is known as T&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he Skeptica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Sagan class vessel that can hold thousands of passengers as we take our trip through the known universe. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First we would like to apologize for a number of things. The captain has had &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/go-easy-on-me.html"&gt;a very full schedule&lt;/a&gt; and it appears that since this is the only vessel that makes this particular trip, he has needed to limit the number of planets to be the best and most interesting. Unfortunately, when he conferred this issue to the home worlds, it appears that &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/circle-submissions.html"&gt;only a few have opened their ports to us&lt;/a&gt;. So we will visit those, and hopefully next time things will be a bit more varied.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But enough excuses, Lets go on our journey!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWMAUwUbI/AAAAAAAABIs/RC3agF12mgQ/s1600-h/image%5B7%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWNmM0Q_I/AAAAAAAABIw/dCaXvmoLZ_M/image_thumb%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="529" height="424"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our first stop is to the Planet Stollznowskiserpakiak. This planet hosted a society vibrant with technology, science,  and wondrous works of art for centuries. The humorous and happy denizens of this planet have long been our ally in our quest for understanding reality as it is. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/ghost-hunting-can-be-a-real-pain-in-the-ass/"&gt;they recently have been invaded by the Rectohaunts&lt;/a&gt;. creatures invading orifices where they most certainly don’t belong. We have dispatched some help, but it looks like for the most part they are getting a good handle on the problem themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We certainly don’t want to get caught up in that, so lets move on to our next destination… Slooeyscepsoc!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWO_zMJFI/AAAAAAAABI0/2-F11SzmnT4/s1600-h/image%5B11%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWQEy6g9I/AAAAAAAABI4/gSXuyrKlHNY/image_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="534" height="402"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is simply no denying that this is a gorgeous world! While the surface is quite barren the seas are teeming with life! There are over 4 million species of creatures here, not including one celled varieties! Much like our own planet, even with so many species, only one of them has developed a consciousness that is advanced enough to communicate with us. These beings are known as the Jurists. This is the best translation we get from their mode of communication, which is a series of bubbles that are read in size of bubble, duration of bubble stream, and velocity of bubbles. It took us about 100 years before we realized that these interesting creatures were sentient. For all that time we just thought they tasted good. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The jurists have an interesting society. Its a pure democracy where everything is decided upon by majority. And when I say everything, I mean everything from the sea crops that they will be pursuing, to the time when they evacuate their Goord bladders. What is more amazing is that for the most part, voting is unanimous! If you look at your personal viewscreeen, &lt;a href="http://stlouisskepticalsociety.blogspot.com/2009/07/jury-duty.html"&gt;you can read what happens when one member of this society questions the biases of the rest of the members&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As we leave you can hear the committee saying “bloob blurg ptblaaaaaP”, which is simply their way of asking us to return soon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Off to our next destination… LV246!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWR_WLFBI/AAAAAAAABI8/WEHDXoNtEFU/s1600-h/image%5B18%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWTuaXs7I/AAAAAAAABJA/pOfDnJF_nMA/image_thumb%5B8%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="487" height="380"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are visiting this green and lush world filled with mystic and ancient knowledge. But don’t let the history of this planet fool you. All their mysticism is based around fundamental principles that can be measured and verified for yourself. We are lucky to have access to this planet. The PodBlackians are currently helping the little sweet green creatures, the Bweedles, a childlike race. They have been transported here from their home planet where they have been harmed emotionally and physically, by forces outside of their control. Our visit will be short so that we do not interrupt &lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1470"&gt;the transfer of tools and knowledge from the PodBlackians to the Bweedles&lt;/a&gt;. They have to do this in secret. The PodBlackians are currently hiding from those very same forces that caused so much damage to the creatures they are helping.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Skeptica is now coming about and heading to over to the Delta quadrant of the universe. Here we are going to visit an interesting world, Auditant. The coolest thing about Auditant is that despite the fact they have developed tremendously complex and intricate buildings, startling advanced electronics and computer systems, and have pushed science to the limit beyond most other civilizations, they don’t have any written language. Everything they do is perfectly recorded and played back at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWVXyjyaI/AAAAAAAABJE/dfdmMg3Bx9c/s1600-h/image%5B22%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWWonHdKI/AAAAAAAABJI/PC9QCL0Lkig/image_thumb%5B10%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="540" height="310"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However the Auditants are &lt;em&gt;prolific&lt;/em&gt;! Lets stop by one of their auditory arenas. These arenas are shaped like football fields where they lob verbal assaults on their targets. For example in this first match we can &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2009/07/hjhop-podcast-9.html"&gt;see the team HJHOP launch a barrage of searing verbal battering rams on a variety of topics&lt;/a&gt; such as a secret society, and some hauntings in one of their provinces. Then you can see the HJHOP team swing around and dive down the format line to score a point by utterly destroying one of the opposing teams biggest windbags who resembles a large pig.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the match, the winning team has assembled a nice evening with some good music for our pleasure. They are hoping their selection will bring us back on every trip.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The auditants have also asked us to take a look in news feeders (there are only 400,000 of them!). But in particular, they thought we might be interested in seeing how they found out &lt;a href="http://audio.wnyc.org/otm/otm070309pod.mp3"&gt;how cultural myths spread and how they get busted up&lt;/a&gt;! We are going to move on, be we have downloaded the audio images you your viewscreens so you can hear them at your leisure as we move on to the next stop!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWXhv9UCI/AAAAAAAABJM/9bui_2JU3Jo/s1600-h/image%5B26%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWYT6LnII/AAAAAAAABJU/8gM8lumLo4s/image_thumb%5B12%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="546" height="309"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Vitelli, is a barren planet but the only surface species left are quite amazing. They come to the surface to socialize and do nothing else. Eating, caring for children, society building and the general advancement of their civilization all happens underground where there are huge fungal gardens and many varieties of game to catch in the many many miles of caverns available to the inhabitants. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happened you ask? Its a long story, and the Vitellians are not quick to discuss it, and for all for formidable stature and dexterity, you can watch as the slouch in shame on this topic. Apparently the Vittelians were not always the quick witted creatures you see before you today. There was a time where they assigned the cause of random negative events to members of their own society. So if something bad happened, they would pursue one of their own, and perform any number of horrendous things to them until they were dead. They have sent us a &lt;a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2009/07/a-tale-of-two-books.html"&gt;brief history of these events, going over the why, the how and the when. But they have also included data about how some of their early ancestors noticed that perhaps this was not the right course of action&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWZ7TORJI/AAAAAAAABJY/sa09AQa-kPg/s1600-h/image%5B31%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;margin-left:0px;border-left-width:0px;margin-right:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWa75B3dI/AAAAAAAABJc/gtJ1rzm4Bho/image_thumb%5B15%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="266" height="353"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Leaving planet Vitelli, in a rare fluke of nature, there is another planet in the very same star system with another sentient species. The Mikes live on the rocky planet Jaqsone. These helmeted creatures do everything in pairs. Everything they build, everything that write, everything they destroy, they do it in couples. Recently however, a visitor from another planet came. A great majority of the population of Jaqsone revered this ghost like visitor who taught them new ways of communicating and moving their double jointed bodies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the visitor from another planet could not live long in the Jaqsonian atmosphere and he came to an early demise. At this news more aliens came to Jaqsone and tried to cash in on his death. The Mikes would have none of this. They loved their visitor, and didn’t want his memory tarnished by buzzards and swindlers who came later. So they wrote &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/the-ghost-of-michael-jackson/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/07/11/psychic-scumbags-are-like-buzzards/"&gt;manifestos&lt;/a&gt; on it, you know, because they do everything in twos.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Honestly I don’t know who is in charge of naming planets, but you would think that they didn’t have to repeat things. We have arrived to the planet Jupiter. No, not our Jupiter. This Jupiter is just as large, but its in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaurus_A"&gt;Centaurus A&lt;/a&gt; galaxy, near the OneBrow Star.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWcoHeUnI/AAAAAAAABJg/zIHS-lvs0dE/s1600-h/image%5B35%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWdlS8-eI/AAAAAAAABJk/M9dLBNYttck/image_thumb%5B17%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="561" height="313"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The inhabitants of Jupiter live underwater. They are not large creatures, they are only about 2 meters tall, but they are amazingly dense! If they were on our planet they would each weigh in at 4 metric tons! They are aware that their species is one of the only sentient bottom dwellers in the universe, and therefore, in a half joking manner, refer to themselves  as People-from-the-Floor-of-the-Ocean. We just refer to them as Floorians. Its appropriate since they call us Walkers.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This species is incredibly advanced. Our guide is just a slightly-smarter-than-standard working guy there, advising architects and building homes, but &lt;a href="http://lifetheuniverseandonebrow.blogspot.com/2009/07/my-oversight-apologies-and-thoughts.html"&gt;look at some of his daily correspondence with his beer drinking colleagues&lt;/a&gt; as they discuss they latest philosophical arguments! Note: Floorian beer tastes very similar to urine, I'm sure you wouldn’t want to try either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You may have thought that after 600 years of reality and game shows on earth we would have pretty much covered everything. But you would be wrong. We are arriving at the planet Cubik.  This planet is an enigma all unto itself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWe0GEFXI/AAAAAAAABJo/nvLhuhDYAIo/s1600-h/image%5B42%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWgB4RP-I/AAAAAAAABJs/87r3UIIkCbw/image_thumb%5B20%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="530" height="398"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The inhabitants look like spider, but they are quite humorous and friendly. They have been at gaming in various forms for thousands of years. Games are used as demonstrations of love, they are use as acts of war, they are used in political processes. There is no aspect of life that does not involve one form or another of gaming whether it be solitary games or massively multiplayer games. While they have certainly has a couple of centuries of of electronic dabbling, mostly they have stuck to games that require physical interaction.  They have built entire societies around games. If you look out your window, you will see the ruins of the old Age of Knights, which involved bigger than life pieces that were played across entire states between mutple opponents. Alas, the age of knights faded away, soon to be replaced by the Age of Colorful board games, The Age of Electronic games, The Video game age and for the last two thousand year they have been in the Game Show Age. Lets try to get a feed…&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ah yes, here we go. Here is &lt;a href="http://cubiksrube.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/play-your-gods-right/"&gt;a game show where a small band of nonbelievers are pitted against believers of the local religion&lt;/a&gt;. In one hour we should be seeing some conversions. I wonder if they have a similar game show where they can get converted back?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now  have a nice surprise for you. We will be visiting Caliban. This planet just opened itself up to us very recently, however its inhabitants have been seen on many other planets for the last few years. That is why we knew they existed. After much encouragement, we are finally able to visit their homeworld.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWhwlCIoI/AAAAAAAABJw/UluYe04xGNM/s1600-h/image%5B47%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWjR6jImI/AAAAAAAABJ0/SZ6u4p52yvE/image_thumb%5B23%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="553" height="443"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While they are ferocious warriors they are also adroit thinkers. Most of their written text whether found in the libraries on Caliban or in texts on other planets you will find strong words, sharp tongue and a warlike stance on many subjects. For example, take a look at how they recently shredded some ancient texts that are no longer useful to the society. &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/05/blogging-bible-part-1.html"&gt;It&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/06/blogging-bible-part-2.html"&gt;comes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/06/blogging-bible-part-3.html"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/06/blogging-bible-part-4.html"&gt;six&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/07/blogging-bible-part-5.html"&gt;scathing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/07/blogging-bible-part-6.html"&gt;chapters&lt;/a&gt; and it is not even done yet! But perhaps you would like to delve into some of their &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/07/days-of-infamy-part-1.html"&gt;military&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/07/days-of-infamy-part-2.html"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;? I wouldn’t want these pesky bastards opposing me!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWkk4oWWI/AAAAAAAABJ4/HV_a1bsoA3w/s1600-h/image%5B51%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWl-XseMI/AAAAAAAABJ8/ZhV4_tKH7QE/image_thumb%5B25%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="550" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are wrapping up our journey here, I hope you have been enjoying your travels. Lets stop at a couple of more planets. First lets jaunt over to Bernardin, this planet is home to one and a half evolving minds. I say one and a half because it is clear that there is one at least a brightly colored tentacled soft spoken creatures, the Drewniads. And while there are certainly a multitude of intelligent creatures on this lush planet there is one in particular that resembles our dogs. We are still trying to determine if these creatures are as sentient and intelligent as the Drewniads, and while there is some evidence of it were are still &lt;a href="http://evolvingmind.info/blog/2009/06/doubting-dog-guilt/"&gt;trying to ascertain the range of emotions these creatures feel.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On our last other worldy stop we are going to Sirius the Dog Star. Around it is a small planet discovered quite some time ago. Again, the alert planet namers decided to call this planet Sirius also. Further… the inhabitants? Yeah they are the Sirians. The largest Ocean? Sirius. The largest landmass? Sirius. It goes on and on. Someone really was slacking at their job.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWniBxLkI/AAAAAAAABKA/O8jcVcWrnPE/s1600-h/image%5B55%5D.png"&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SmAWpESI4qI/AAAAAAAABKI/O7ZE5F7kSvg/image_thumb%5B27%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="546" height="406"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The planet itself is the height of beauty and wonder however. The gorgeous landscapes are so striking they just make you want to get down on your knees and thank the universe for being so wonderful. In fact, the Sirians do exactly that every evening. Its a good break from their daily routine where they are far more serious about what else the universe brings them!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Sirians are a rambling lot. They often have sessions just telling each other what they think the other person doesn’t know. In fact, they’ve got long lists of things that should not be mention because they are bad form. but when they get away from their loquacious vomit, they sometimes write about softer, happier things. Let me give you &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2009/07/what-soul-means.html"&gt;a recent submission on the Sirian soul.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OK, we are heading back to Earth. We, the crew of the Skeptica have truly enjoyed touring the universe with you and we hope you will return soon and often. Before you leave the vessel, make sure you avoid the drinking the water at the starport. &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/calcium-woomover.html"&gt;We have new water treatment facilities but we are unsure if they are working&lt;/a&gt; properly. Also, as you leave the port, there may be people from a completely different dimension handing you flyers about how to get to their homes. &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/bad-business-practice.html"&gt;We do not recommend it&lt;/a&gt;. As you leave feel free to take one of the touring guides with you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;h3 align="center"&gt;Touring Guide&lt;/h3&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/ghost-hunting-can-be-a-real-pain-in-the-ass/"&gt;The SkepBitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stlouisskepticalsociety.blogspot.com/2009/07/jury-duty.html"&gt;St. Louis Skeptical Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://podblack.com/?p=1470"&gt;PodBlack Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2009/07/hjhop-podcast-9.html"&gt;Happy Jihads House of Pancakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://drvitelli.typepad.com/providentia/2009/07/a-tale-of-two-books.html"&gt;Providentia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/07/06/the-ghost-of-michael-jackson/"&gt;Skeptical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepticalteacher.wordpress.com/2009/07/11/psychic-scumbags-are-like-buzzards/"&gt;Teacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lifetheuniverseandonebrow.blogspot.com/2009/07/my-oversight-apologies-and-thoughts.html"&gt;Life, The Universe and One Brow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cubiksrube.wordpress.com/2009/07/03/play-your-gods-right/"&gt;Cubik’s Rube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://terribletruth-beautifullie.blogspot.com/2009/07/blogging-bible-part-6.html"&gt;Terrible Truth, Beautiful Lie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://evolvingmind.info/blog/2009/06/doubting-dog-guilt/"&gt;Evolving Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2009/07/what-soul-means.html"&gt;The Bronze Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/calcium-woomover.html"&gt;Effort&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/bad-business-practice.html"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Captain’s Note: I realize that some of the material presented here may be owned by the artist.

&lt;p&gt;1. Fail to predict your best friend / employer’s &lt;a href="http://www.news-press.com/article/20090716/ENT/90716048/1013"&gt;sudden death&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;He never thought he’d be CEO material.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet here he is, running the 6-year-old John Entwistle Foundation, working every day to get musical instruments into the hands of poor and sick kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“If you want to make God laugh,” Luongo said, “tell him your plans.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, Luongo never predicted Entwistle would die so unexpectedly in 2002. When that happened, Luongo found himself without a job and without his best friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And without a purpose, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when he got the idea for the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Expect to have a &lt;a href="http://www.dailybreeze.com/lifeandculture/ci_12845681"&gt;healthy child&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Garrett is 13 now and though he still doesn’t have his words, therapy has helped him to communicate with his family and he has learned to ski. He continues to undergo behavioral, speech and occupational therapy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things that you once thought would be accomplished at that age; it’s completely different when they hit that age,” said Carolyn Robb. &lt;b&gt;“If you want to make God laugh, tell him you have plans.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Assume that your father won’t need emergency heart surgery &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-11016-Boston-Endurance-Sports-Examiner~y2009m7d15-What-gets-you-out-of-bed-in-the-morning"&gt;during your ultramarathon&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;How’s the saying go: &lt;b&gt;“Want to make God laugh? Tell him about your plans.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was to be the year I really crushed it. My plans were to head out to Death Valley a week in advance of the event to heat acclimatize, something I’d never done before. Well, a day before my scheduled departure, my father goes in for a routine procedure and discovers he needs urgent heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mychal Judge, chaplain of New York City’s fire department who was among those killed in the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11th, was fond of the saying &lt;b&gt;“if you want to make God laugh, tell Him what you’re doing tomorrow.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was done with total transparency.  We invited all TAMgoers, as well as media representatives and famous skeptics and magicians, to attend a preliminary Challenge test of Ms. Connie Sonne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who weren't able to attend in person, we streamed the test live so those at home could watch from their computers. We had six hundred people watching from the audience, and 1,600 watching from home. The in-person audience included people like Penn and Teller, Mac King, Jamy Ian Swiss, Dr. Joe Albietz, and, of course, Randi. The video was viewed by people from all over the world, just as it happened in real time.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>alison@randi.org (Alison Smith)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247808564769"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/shoes_to_sate_the_masses.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e87c8ef49c620523</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Shoes to Sate the Masses...</title><published>2009-07-17T03:53:34Z</published><updated>2009-07-17T03:53:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/NaJH98edGtI/shoes_to_sate_the_masses.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/shoes_to_sate_the_masses.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of you has asked for shoes instead of snark.

Today's quote, for example "information on the force effects of children".  The force effects of children?  When merely thrown?  Or when using some sort of specialized device, such as a child-size trebuchet or slingshot?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="giant slingshot.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/giant%20slingshot.jpg" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Kid sized!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, no, this paper is not about forces of children when used as objects.  It's about the forces of children used for doors.  Refrigerator doors, actually.  A study like this would probably never fly now, but heck, the world of child psychology was young.  It was 1958.&lt;/p&gt;

Man, the interest just kills ya every time, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein is now the spokesman for freescore.com, and in addition to appearing in annoying ads on the web like the one here to the right, he’s doing commercials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/ben-stein-selling-free-credit-reports-for-a-dollar/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/fkY2BdQdqIM/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/ben_stein_sinking_ever_lower/stein_ad.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/ben_stein_sinking_ever_lower/stein_ad.jpeg" alt="" width="413" height="164"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to freescore.com and found out my score for free”, says Ben, while an annoying squirrel holds up a sign with the word “FREE” in some horrible brush-script font.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few points are worth noting here. First, the score itself is not very useful to consumers. What’s useful is the &lt;em&gt;report&lt;/em&gt; — if there’s an error on the report, then the consumer can try to rectify it. Secondly, and much more importantly, if you want a free credit report, there’s only one place to go: &lt;a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/cra/index.jsp"&gt;annualcreditreport.com&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the place where the big three credit-rating agencies will give you a genuinely free copy of your credit report once a year, as required by federal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t be surprised to hear that freescore.com is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; free: in order to get any information out of them at all, you have to authorize them to charge you a $29.95 monthly fee. They even extract a dollar out of you up front, just to make sure that money is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein, here, has become a predatory bait-and-switch merchant, dangling a “free” credit report in front of people so that he can sock them with a massive monthly fee for, essentially, doing nothing at all. Naturally, the people who take him up on this offer will be those who can least afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well defrauding the public is Stein’s specialty. This is also grounds for dismissal at the NY Times, where Stein writes as the “Everybody’s Business” columnist, not only because of the hypocrisy of working as a financial advice columnist while simultaneously deceiving the public  into paying for a service that’s available for free, but also for being a paid shill for that very product, which is the very definition of a conflict of interest.Oh, and then there’s this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/nyts_ben_stein_hawks_misleadin.php"&gt;Ryan Chittum&lt;/a&gt; notes that the new credit card act &lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/5270331/card-act-includes-limits-on-not+so+free-credit-report-ads"&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; advertisers to inform consumers that the only place for a free credit report is &lt;a href="http://annualcreditreport.com./"&gt;AnnualCreditReport.com&lt;/a&gt;; they will also be required to include a   statement that “This is not the free credit report provided for by Federal law.” When does this act come into force?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: It’s also worth quoting the NYT’s own &lt;a href="http://www.nytco.com/press/ethics.html#steering"&gt;ethics guidelines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;40. It is an inherent conflict for a journalist to perform public relations work,             paid or unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;44. Staff members may not engage in financial counseling (except through the articles they write). They may not manage money for others, offer investment advice, or help operate an investment company of any sort, with or without pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein isn’t a staff member. But the NYT generally holds its columnists to the same ethical standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, &lt;a href="http://datatoinformation.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/ben-stein-steals-your-money/"&gt;freescore.com is allegedly a subsidiary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://datatoinformation.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/ben-stein-steals-your-money/"&gt; of Vertrue Inc&lt;/a&gt;., which has a long history of  deceptive business practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as a character in a movie once said, “We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking.” (Can’t believe Cameron Diaz turned out to be the only sane one in that movie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want a free credit report that REALLY is FREE, go to annualcreditreport.com and accept no substitute. It’s the only one that’s federally mandated:&lt;/p&gt;

When gems or oil/gas production exist inside a conflict zone, more combat deaths tend to result.  This finding comes from an analysis of 258 worldwide conflicts conducted by Paivi Lujala from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lujala's research builds on earlier studies showing linking the presence of natural resources to the onset and likelihood of armed conflict in a given area.  His analysis extends this knowledge by focusing on the impact of these resources on conflict severity.  Severity was measured by the total number of combat deaths and the average rate of combat deaths (which he refers to as a measure of  "intensity").  He also was able to compare effects inside vs outside of conflict zones within a given country, rather than just using the country as a single geographic unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study examined three commonly occurring natural resources:  (1) gemstone mining; (2) Hydrocarbon (crude oil/natrual gas) production; and (3) illicit drug cultivation (cocoa, opium poppy, &amp;amp; cannabis).  Results are interesting and some are a bit surprising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think for a moment about which of these three resources  - gems, hydrocarbons, or drugs - you would immediately associate with an increase in combat deaths.  Here's a hint - Two of them are linked to an increase in deaths and one is associated with fewer deaths.  OK - if you read the headline, you know the answer.  Drug cultivation inside conflict zones is linked to fewer - yes, fewer - combat deaths and a lower battle death rate.  Tony Addison and colleagues - in analyzing African conflicts - have suggested that this kind of effect may occur because combatants on both sides of a conflict spend some proportion of their time looting resources rather than just killing each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gems and hydrocarbons, on the other hand, significantly raised the risk of severity.  Gemstone production inside the conflict zone basically doubled the the number of conflict fatalities .  Similarly, when oil and gas production existed inside the zone, more than twice as many combat deaths occurred as when that production was absent.   The effect was most pronounced in secessionist conflicts.    A seemingly significant mechanism in both cases is that conflicts seem to go on longer when these resources are inside the conflict zone.  Longer conflicts, of course,  tend to produce more deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drilling down further (no pun intended), though, oil and gas production was associated with lower severity (lower rate and fewer deaths) when it was present in the country/region, but existed outside the conflict zone.  Perhaps this is because the resources are less accessible to rebel combatants, and they continue to provide a source of revenue for the government/military, which may then be able to invest more in quashing the rebellion and ending the conflict sooner (shortening the duration).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though not the focus of this particular study, a: couple of incidental severity predictors emerged and are worth noting:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The comparative size/strength of state military and rebel forces affects severity.  The death toll tends to be highest when both force sizes are more equal.  When the rebel forces are notable weaker, the rate of overall combat deaths seems to be lower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conflicts tended to be more severe when they:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;occurred during the Cold War period&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;were fought in mountainous terrain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;were fought in more populated countries and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;were internationalized internal conflicts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Conflicts tended to be less severe in countries that were more democratic and ethnically heterogeneous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Conflict+Resolution&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1177%2F0022002708327644&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Deadly+Combat+over+Natural+Resources%3A+Gems%2C+Petroleum%2C+Drugs%2C+and+the+Severity+of+Armed+Civil+Conflict&amp;amp;rft.issn=0022-0027&amp;amp;rft.date=2008&amp;amp;rft.volume=53&amp;amp;rft.issue=1&amp;amp;rft.spage=50&amp;amp;rft.epage=71&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fjcr.sagepub.com%2Fcgi%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F0022002708327644&amp;amp;rft.au=Lujala%2C+P.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Social+Science%2CPolitical+Science%2C+International+Security%2C+Global+Security%2C+Armed+Groups%2C+Armed+Conflict%2C+Terrorism%2C+Violent+Extremism%2C+Radicalization%2C+Nonstate+Actors%2C+National+Security"&gt;Lujala, P.

Notably, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363547/"&gt;DAWN OF THE DEAD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/"&gt;28 DAYS LATER&lt;/a&gt; (as a franchise), &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/"&gt;RESIDE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/"&gt;NT EVIL&lt;/a&gt; (as a franchise), &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/"&gt;I AM LEGEND&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1082868/"&gt;QUARANTINE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/"&gt;SHAUN OF THE DEAD&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the upcoming films &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/"&gt;ZOMBIELAND&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816711/"&gt;WORLD WAR Z&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1374989/"&gt;PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES&lt;/a&gt;.  With this classic monster in mind, we wondered at The Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange, where one can find teaching moments that could inspire science-based conversation on the undead.   You’d be surprised, there’s a lot to learn from our brain-eating buddies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, Harvard Professor of Psychiatry, Dr. Steven C. Schlozman drafted a fake medical journal article on &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5286145/a-harvard-psychiatrist-explains-zombie-neurobiology"&gt;Ataxic Neurodegenerative Satiety Deficiency Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or ANSD.  The piece was authored by five researchers, including three who worked on the piece posthumously and one “humanoid infected.”   While the premise of walking dead was obviously conjured for the article, the remaining science was real.   The essay inspired many zombie fans to read about neuroscience and think about the structure of the brain in a way they may not have otherwise.  So there’s an example of fiction exciting  people to learn facts about their own brains, but are there examples of real zombie-like creatures?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Canadian ethnobotanist Wade Davis, who made a pretty strong case for the pharmacological basis of zombification in his 1985 book, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Serpent_and_the_Rainbow_%28book%29"&gt;The Serpent and the Rainbow&lt;/a&gt; (which was later made into a film directed by &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000127/"&gt;Wes Craven&lt;/a&gt;).   Davis also penned a more scholarly tome, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passage-Darkness-Ethnobiology-Haitian-Zombie/dp/0807842109"&gt;Passage of Darkness: The Ethnobiology of the Haitian Zombie&lt;/a&gt;, in 1988.  He discovered that Haitian voodoo priests relied on complex powders in their rituals.  The ingredients differed according to region, but of seven of the eight samples he managed to collect contained pufferfish, a marine toad, a hyla tree frog, and human remains.  The first two are the most pertinent, since both animals secrete powerful neurotoxins - chemicals that change the way neurons in the brain function, either by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters or enhancing them to harmful levels.  Interfere with this complex communication system, and you can interrupt speech, thought processes, motor function, even respiration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Davis, Tetrodoxin - a powerful neurotoxin - is a key ingredient in Haitian zombification rituals.  The other crucial ingredient is a toxin produced by the sea toad (bufo Marinas) as a defense mechanism.  A voodoo priest (boko) will poison a victim, causing him or her to become catatonic, and often mistaken for dead.  Said victim is buried, the drug wears off after a few days, and the boko can exhume the "zombie" to make them a personal slave.  Ah, but how to get the victim to do the boko's bidding, like any good zombie should?  Apparently, this is achieved via regular doses of datura stramonium (more commonly known as jimson weed), an extract of the thorn apple, which makes the victim docile and biddable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the ritualistic practices Dr. Davis documented were further confirmed by British researchers in the 1990s, they didn't find any examples of real zombies.  Usually, people labeled as such were suffering from mental diseases, such as catatonic schizophrenia or an organic brain disorder. In other cases, it was as simple as mistaken identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sl-2qAfi20I/AAAAAAAAADU/wXOKqvHBXqg/s1600-h/220px-Ampulex_compressa.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:213px;height:320px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Sl-2qAfi20I/AAAAAAAAADU/wXOKqvHBXqg/s320/220px-Ampulex_compressa.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Perhaps human zombies are a tall order, however there does seem be a living example of zombification in Nature.  Scientists at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel figured out how a certain species of wasp (the emerald cockroach wasp/jewel wasp, or Ampulex Compressa) managed to turn innocent cockroaches into willing "zombie slaves."  Lots of venomous creatures stun their victims before devouring them, but this particular species of wasp will sting its victim, so that the prey is able to walk, but can't do so of its own accord. The predator-wasp literally grabs the roach's antenna and leads it back to the wasp nest. There, instead of eating the roach, the wasp lays an egg on its belly.   Eventually a larva hatches and devours the still-docile roach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BGU researcher Frederic Liberstat and his colleagues knew the secret lay in "a rich cocktail of toxins" that the wasp injects into its victims.  They theorized that the venom blocks a key chemical messenger in the brain called octopamine.  This chemical is what makes insects alert, motivates them to move and perform physical tasks.  It serves a similar purpose as noradrenaline, a chemical messenger involved in the "flight or fight" response.   To test their hypothesis, they managed to replicate the effect by injecting cockroaches in the lab, and even figured out how to "un-zombify" the bugs by following up with an antidote injection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, the next time someone tells you that zombies are the creation of overactive imaginations, remember the Ampulex Compressa and it's pacified roach incubators.

Last week I wrote &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/why_jesus_makes_me_a_bad_scien.php"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. It got a few comments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;In the post I made mention of the recent hot topic in the 'sphere, Sheril and Chris's &lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/index.php"&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/a&gt;. Like one of my Sciblings (see Zuska's post &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2009/07/i_have_a_blog_i_dont_need_to_r.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) I have not yet read the book. I know, I know.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/what_the_balls_is_the_matter_w/femtired.gif" alt="femtired.gif" height="703" width="455"&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.decodog.com/inven/MD/md28731.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: I plan to read it as soon as the grant is done. I'd much rather be reading because I am exhausted with granting, but you know that Mama's got to get that ca-a-a-ash. Maybe some of the stuff from this ad will help. The text reads: &lt;em&gt;Why is this woman tired. She may be tired for either of two reasons:  1) because she is physically overworked. If this is the case, you prescribe rest, because rest is the only cure for this kind of physical problem.  2) because she is mentally &amp;quot;done in.&amp;quot; Many of your patients -- particularly housewives -- are crushed under a load of dull, routine duties that leave them in a state of mental and emotional fatigue. For these patients, you may find &amp;#39;Dexedrine&amp;#39; an ideal prescription. &amp;#39;Dexedrine&amp;#39; will give them a feeling of energy and well-being, renewing their interest in life and living.  I Dexedrine* (dextro-amphetamine sulfate, S.K.F.) is available as tablets, elixir, and Spansule* capsules (sustained release capsules, S.K.F.) and is manufactured by Smith, Kline &amp;amp; French Laboratories, Philadelphia. &lt;/em&gt;  Wow, that was a long diversion...&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;In the post I made reference to the fact that the book has been controversial around these parts, specifically with respect to the way in which &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; and the &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot; are portrayed.   I linked to one of PZ&amp;#39;s posts discussing his objections to their book.  I also linked to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/07/congrats_on_the_transformation.php"&gt;ERV's post&lt;/a&gt; in which she essentially, as I interpreted it, calls Sheril and Chris &amp;quot;traitors.&amp;quot;  I don&amp;#39;t think my interpretation of her post was incorrect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;I then went on to make the statement that I have tended to shy away from the discussion of religion and science (which is what chapter 8 is about, right?  I mean, I will admit I haven&amp;#39;t read it yet....)  because the discussions tend to devolve to discussion of whether or not we can scientifically test whether there is a god. 
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;Link to PZ.  Check.  Link to ERV to capture the conversation about the book as I had seen it. Check.  Mention about why I generally don&amp;#39;t typically find discussions of science and religion interesting.  Check.  New stuff about something I thought was interesting. Check.  Recap complete. 
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;But, then  ERV leaves some wackiness in my comments that I just don&amp;#39;t get.  I was willing to grant that maybe I am not as hip to the LOLSpeak as our friend, ERV.  THEN I go over to her &amp;quot;blag&amp;quot; and find more wackiness that I do understand and I am now convinced that our Scibling has done lost her mind.  Either that, or she&amp;#39;s been working in the lab without lowering the sash on the fumehood.
  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a &lt;i&gt;minimal&lt;/i&gt; step, however, and it really doesn't address any of my objections to the guy. The foundation and its web site will still be going on, and you know that once he finishes his tenure at NIH, he'll just step back into it.

Upon raising the stone, he found traces of an ancient tomb with potsherds and small undamaged vessels. The antiquities service in Syria was informed who, in turn notified the French archeologist Mons. Ch. Virolleaud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stone that the peasant had hit turned out to be just an ancient necropolis with little promise. However, the archaeologist in the team next turned their attention to an artificial near by mound (named by locals as Ras-ashShamrah), which, when explored, proved to be the site of the ancient city know in texts from Babylonian, Hittite and Egyptian as the city of Ugarit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excavation carried out by the French archaeologist Mons. C.F.A. Schaeffer between 1929 and 1939 and then continued after WWII, have unearth thousands of clay tablets around the main library attached to the temple of Baal. The tablets are dated between 1400 and 1350 BCE and are extremely varied in their contents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The script of the tablets are written in Akkadian, Hurrian and Sumerian, but the native language of the city is a script using the cuneiform symbols based on an alphabetic constant signs now classified in the group of Northwest Semitic languages which predates Hebrew. This language, now know as Ugaritic, is the parent language of the Israelites who are said to have spoken Hebrew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the name of one of the gods in the text was called “Baal” and of whose temple the library it was next to, the city has now been identified with the Canaanites with whom the Israelites are said to have taken the land from to form Israel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Modern scholars of the Hebrew Bible such as Richard Clifford, Frank M. Cross, Nicholas Wyatt, Mark Smith, John Day, William Dever, J.C. de Moor the late Marvin Pope, C.H Gordon and M. Dahood see a direct connection or continuation of Canaanite stories in the older cycles of the Israelite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example here is Psalm 29 which is traditionally assigned to King David, but is basically a reworked Canaanite hymn from Ugarit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, did this connection and continuation of Canaanite material end in with the Hebrew Bible or is this tradition (which was once held in high regards by the early Israelites) still able to shape the New Testament? I think so and I list the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. Jesus never calls the deity of his Jewish nation by his personal proper name Yahweh, but simply Theos = El ("El" is Hebrew for god) . El is the same name of the supreme god of the Canaanites at Ugarit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. Jesus calls El “Abba” or father: (“And He was saying, "Abba! Father! All things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will." Mark 14: 36). Jesus tells his disciples to call El also “father” in the Lord’s Prayer. Baal calls his god “ab” or father too. Both divine fathers of Jesus and Baal (El, the supreme god of the Jews and the Canaanites) are fatherly figure gods who live in Heaven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. Jesus is called “Lord” many times by his followers in the Gospels and Jesus is identified with God in the Gospels. Likewise, God is Jesus’ heavenly father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Ugaritic texts, the term b’l=baal can simply mean “Lord” or elsewhere it can be used as a proper name “Baal” where he is the title of the chief god of the Canaanites who is the son of the supreme god El.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D. Jesus descends and returns from the neither world (Hell) (For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. Matt. 12:40 and “By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; I Peter 3:19) so too does Baal descend and return from the underworld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;E. Jesus stills a storm on the Sea of Galilee, so too does Baal control the wind and weather.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;F. Jesus intervenes between his followers and God his father. So too does Baal intervene between the people of Ugarit and El his father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;G. Jesus is depicted as King seated on a throne ruling his kingdom and giving righteous judgments. So too is Baal seated on his throne ruling a kingdom with righteous judgments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;H. In the Book of Revelation, Jesus fights and kills the evil serpent / dragon. So too does Baal fight and kill the twisted serpent Ugaritic “ltn btn brh” (Litanu, the serpent or Leviathan).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I. Biblical numbers such as 3, 6, 7 and 40 are used many times in the New Testament are used equally in the Ugaritic text to give divine meaning to these Canaanite texts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7904281888182441911?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Dr. Richard Carrier &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been sending Dr. Michael Martin the material along the way. He is professor of philosophy emeritus and author of the books &lt;em&gt;The Case Against Christianity&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Atheism: A Philosophical Justification&lt;/em&gt;. Of this book he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;John Loftus and his distinguished colleagues have certainly produced one of the best and arguably &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; best critique of the Christian faith the world has ever known. Using sociological, biblical, scientific, historical, philosophical, theological and ethical criticisms, this book completely destroys Christianity. All but the most fanatical believers who read it should be moved to have profound doubts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;---------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the editor of this new work I designed it to be an extension of my book &lt;em&gt;Why I Became an Atheist: A Former Preacher Rejects Christianity&lt;/em&gt;, and so it further argues for the things I did there.

What it is about is this interesting paper which set out to find moons around Venus and (you may know this already) found none....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

It may very well be the most important paper of the year, even more influential and ground-breaking than &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinius"&gt;Ida&lt;/a&gt; (though I wouldn't mention that to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/idathefossil"&gt;her directly&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I'm talking about the newest paper published in &lt;a href="http://www.springer.com/life+sci/ecology/journal/227"&gt;Marine Biology&lt;/a&gt;'s "Online First", &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/3730q08q134w7236/?p=a3c6e360eba04904b28e20bb71faab6b&amp;amp;pi=0"&gt;Fiddler crab burrowing affects growth and production of the white mangrove (&lt;i&gt;Laguncularia racemosa&lt;/i&gt;) in a restored Florida coastal marsh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/Sl-dvNtMSiI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/ShwtvoZf-WQ/s1600-h/DSC02346.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:300px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/Sl-dvNtMSiI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/ShwtvoZf-WQ/s320/DSC02346.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This paper, written by three, top-notch biologists out of &lt;a href="http://www.eckerd.edu"&gt;Eckerd College&lt;/a&gt;, explores the relationship between fiddler crab burrowing activity and the growth of young white mangroves through two different pathways. The first was a transect study, where mangrove growth variables were compared to burrow density and other plant density in a natural setting. The other used mesh cages to selectively reduce or allow burrowing activity around seedlings to study not only the growth differences but changes in the soil chemistry without the affects of other plants in the area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin:0 10px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/Sl-eViMqBSI/AAAAAAAAAZg/1kt-nQF1EoQ/s1600-h/DSC02339.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:150px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/Sl-eViMqBSI/AAAAAAAAAZg/1kt-nQF1EoQ/s200/DSC02339.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/Sl-ejFwxbGI/AAAAAAAAAZo/B0hMQKCBui4/s1600-h/DSC02340.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:200px;height:150px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0nYJoEA5fiU/Sl-ejFwxbGI/AAAAAAAAAZo/B0hMQKCBui4/s200/DSC02340.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The sum results of the two were clear - fiddler crabs had a big impact. By digging burrows, they increased mangrove growth and proliferation by ~25%, and dramatically changed the soil chemistry. Their presence decreased salinity from over 44.2 to 32.4 and changed the oxidation potential, meaning they made the soils far more mangrove-friendly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this might seem like a small study, it's actually quite important. Mangroves are some of the most important ecosystems in the tropics, providing food and shelter for many commercially and ecologically important species. And, most importantly, we've done a fantastic job of destroying them as humans have decided that treed, swampy coasts are far less pretty to build a house on than just pristine, bulldozed sand. Now, millions of dollars are being pumped into restoration efforts, and the more we know about how to cultivate and encourage the growth of these fickle but critical trees, the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There might also be one other reason that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; think this paper is so damned important... but I'll let you figure that one out for yourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size="1"&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Marine+Biology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1007%2Fs00227-009-1253-7&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Fiddler+crab+burrowing+affects+growth+and+production+of+the+white+mangrove+%28Laguncularia+racemosa%29+in+a+restored+Florida+coastal+marsh&amp;amp;rft.issn=0025-3162&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springerlink.com%2Findex%2F10.1007%2Fs00227-009-1253-7&amp;amp;rft.au=Smith%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Wilcox%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Lessmann%2C+J.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology"&gt;Smith, N., Wilcox, C., &amp;amp; Lessmann, J.

What fewer people know is that there is great diversity in how neurons signal. There are many sensory neurons and interneurons that work entirely without action potentials. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I once asked my Ph.D. supervisor, Dorothy Paul, “Is there such a thing as a non-spiking motor neuron?” Dorothy did most of her research working on non-spiking sensory neurons in the west coast mole crab, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Emerita analoga&lt;/span&gt;. She didn’t give me the answer, but told me it was an excellent question and I should think about it. Some time later, I heard another student asking the same question to another researcher at a poster at a Society for Neuroscience poster, and the person said, “No.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This paper says the answer is, “Yes.” There are non-spiking motor neurons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sl95Tzw3hEI/AAAAAAAACC0/jMM4gC4MDhc/s1600-h/c_elegans.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:90px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sl95Tzw3hEI/AAAAAAAACC0/jMM4gC4MDhc/s200/c_elegans.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Qiang Liu and colleagues did their research on the little nematode worm, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/span&gt;, and were able to take advantage of the huge knowledge of the genetics of this beast, and our ability to manipulate this animal’s genes. They recorded the output of muscle cells using standard electrical recordings, but instead of using electricity to stimulate the motor neurons controlling those muscles – the classical way of doing things – they genetically engineered the worm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors were able to make the worms express a protein called channelrhodopsin in certain neurons. Rhodopsin is a visual pigment that responds to light. When you flash a light on these worms (did I mention they’re transparent?), the channelrhodopsin opens up a channel that allows electrical current to flow into the neuron. Thus, you can use a flash of light to fire neurons of your choosing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sl-KaittGBI/AAAAAAAACC8/sZPRizctEGQ/s1600-h/Liu_et_al._2009_nonspiking_MNs.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:101px;height:200px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/Sl-KaittGBI/AAAAAAAACC8/sZPRizctEGQ/s200/Liu_et_al._2009_nonspiking_MNs.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In neurons with action potentials, activity is like a light switch: flipping the switch harder doesn’t make the light from the bulb any brighter. A key set of data is to increase the light intensity stimulating the motor neurons (shown by different line colours in the figure here), and record the response of the motor neurons. If there was a classic action potential in the motor neuron, you’d expect there to be no response until you hit a threshold, and always the same response in the muscle. But the effect is more like a dimmer than a switch: the greater the light intensity to the motor neurons, the more the muscles responded. This is just what you would as expect for a non-spiking neuron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There rest of this paper revolves around characterizing the synaptic connections between motor neuron and muscle in much more detail. It mainly looks at how the strength of connections between the cells change with repeated stimulation of the motor neurons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not the first demonstration of non-spiking motor neurons. Another nematode, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ascaris&lt;/span&gt;, probably claimed that honor two decades ago (Stretton and Davis 1989). So while I did learn quite a bit from this paper (I didn’t know about the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ascaris&lt;/span&gt; work) and am impressed with the techniques in this paper, I am still a bit puzzled as to why it’s in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Science&lt;/span&gt; (PNAS). &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;PNAS&lt;/span&gt; is one of those exclusive high profile journals, sometimes disparagingly called a “glamour mag,” that publishes on what it considers to be “high impact” science. I guess this paper made it in because &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;C. elegans&lt;/span&gt; has become such an important model organism, because this paper doesn’t show any previously unknown or unexpected kind of phenomenon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But considering that the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Ascaris&lt;/span&gt; work was published before I asked my supervisor about non-spiking motor neurons, I suppose that the phenomenon could stand to be much better known in the neurobiology community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1073%2Fpnas.0903570106&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Graded+synaptic+transmission+at+the+Caenorhabditis+elegans+neuromuscular+junction&amp;amp;rft.issn=0027-8424&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=106&amp;amp;rft.issue=26&amp;amp;rft.spage=10823&amp;amp;rft.epage=10828&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnas.org%2Fcgi%2Fdoi%2F10.1073%2Fpnas.0903570106&amp;amp;rft.au=Liu%2C+Q.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hollopeter%2C+G.&amp;amp;rft.au=Jorgensen%2C+E.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CNeuroscience%2CZoology%2C+Physiology"&gt;Liu, Q., Hollopeter, G., &amp;amp; Jorgensen, E.

&lt;p&gt;There's tons of stuff on tongue twisters, most of it what I think of as "tongue twister appreciation": collections  of them, sometimes in a number of languages, for the reader's enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also a certain amount of technical literature about them, in particular some linguistic studies about the patterns that make people prone to the errors (of the substitution/transposition type) in certain expressions. The /s/-/ʃ/ alternations in &amp;quot;She sells seashells …&amp;quot; are somewhat troublesome, but far from the worst there is (as in things like &amp;quot;rubber baby buggy bumpers&amp;quot;, which makes grave problems for almost all &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; speakers, especially when these speakers are asked to repeat the expression).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, speech therapists don't use tongue twisters as a teaching tool (though I could be wrong).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Zwicky Arnold</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247786304742"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13847">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb39ea02f7e34597</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><category term="Churches"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">What Could You Never Say in Church?</title><published>2009-07-16T23:00:55Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T23:00:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/16/what-could-you-never-say-in-church/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;strong&gt;Anne Jackson&lt;/strong&gt; is going to publish a book later this year called &lt;em&gt;Permission to Speak Freely&lt;/em&gt;.  It’s a sort of Christian version of &lt;a href="http://postsecret.blogspot.com/"&gt;PostSecret&lt;/a&gt;, where people confess things they believe &lt;em&gt;but feel they cannot say in church&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="http://www.flowerdust.net/2009/06/15/keeping-your-mouth-shut/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;… I support civil unions for homosexual couples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;… I just had a drink last night and it tasted really good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hate it when people ask for prayer for their neighbors brother’s cousin (or some person like 5 times linked in the distance from the person you actually know). Seriously, why does that need to go in OUR church bulletin? We don’t know them! I don’t even take enough (or hardly any) time to pray for myself and MY family, let alone will i ever care to pray for your neighbors brother’s cousin!! I hate that prayer has become so competitive…who can share the saddest and most dramatic sob story…thinking if their’s is the best people will pray for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a current Christian to remember what you thought when you went to church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to include your thoughts in her book (a large Christian audience will see it, if that’s any incentive), &lt;a href="http://www.flowerdust.net/2009/07/14/be-in-my-new-book-get-the-first-1200-words-it-free/"&gt;Anne is taking submissions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1) Write down your confession.&lt;/strong&gt; What’s something you feel like you can’t say in church. You can make it as short or as long as you want. You can write it on anything you want — a piece of paper like a letter, a postcard, a bulletin, a page from the Bible, a photograph, a drawing, ANYTHING at all that you can mail. It can be any shape, any size. It doesn’t have uber creative (although it certainly can be). It can just be something written down. You also don’t have to currently attend church or even believe in God.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information is &lt;a href="http://www.flowerdust.net/2009/07/14/be-in-my-new-book-get-the-first-1200-words-it-free/"&gt;on her site&lt;/a&gt; (along with some fine print).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m looking forward to reading this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you’re not wanting to send something to Anne, feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments: &lt;strong&gt;What could you never say when you went to church?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I keep waiting for that perfect news story or perfect resource to key into, and while I wait time slowly passes...and commenters on the earlier post &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stereotypes_about_not_working"&gt;Stereotypes About Not Working&lt;/a&gt; are quick to point out the key role transportation plays in whether one can look for, or get, or keep, a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation has a lot of parts:  Is transportation available when it is needed?  Where it is needed?  Is the transportation accessible?  Is the process of &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; the transportation accessible?  Is the transportation &lt;em&gt;affordable&lt;/em&gt;?  Is a person's place of living &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; place of employment near accessible, affordable transportation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation services surely have improved in recent decades.  Public transportation must be accessible according to the law.  Some services such as vocational rehabilitation and state or county DD services may provide transportation assistance in the form of transportation passes, access to paratransit, or education about using transportation.  Some public transportation services have their own &lt;a href="http://trimet.org/ridewise/index.htm"&gt;educational&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://trimet.org/fares/honoredcitizen.htm"&gt;cost-subsidized&lt;/a&gt; programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about people in more rural areas where public transportation may not exist at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about people who are (sometimes not by choice) living in locations that are not near transportation lines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about people who may live near transportation lines but that transportation does not cover the areas where the jobs are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about people who don't have access to rider education or subsidized fares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An oncologist goes to check on his patient, a 90 year-old man with Alzheimer's disease and metastatic pancreatic cancer.  The doc is about to start him on a new round of chemo, but when he goes to the patient's room, he's not there.

&lt;p&gt;He demands of the nurse, "Where's my patient?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He took a turn for the worse and was transferred to the ICU.  He looks like he's reached the end."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"My patients don't just die!" he says as he picks up the bag of chemo and marches to the ICU.  When he gets there, he asks the charge nurse where he can find his patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry, Doctor, but he's gone.  He was just at the end of his road."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But where &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; he?" &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking the doctor wanted to pay his last respects, the nurse told him, "Connell Brothers Funeral Home."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor picked up the bag of chemo, got in his car and drove to the funeral home.  When he arrived, he marched up to the funeral director and said, "Where's my patient?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He's in the viewing room, sir."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oncologist marched into the viewing room with the bag of chemo, ready to hook up his patient...but the casket was empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Where's my patient?" he asked of the man in the suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry, sir, he's in dialysis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans are, in general, people of faith.  We &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; in certain principles, such as freedom, liberty, and equality.  Most Americans even believe in an unseeable, unknowable being in the sky.  But there is one thing most Americans do not believe in---death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Death is as foreign to Americans as sub-compact diesels, siestas, or socialized medicine.  Anyone who works in a hospital knows that the intensive care unit is full of patients who should be dead.  They are hooked up to breathing machines, kidney machines, machines to pump food into their stomachs, etc.  They have a near-zero chance of meaningful recovery.  Still, families often demand of doctors that we "do everything".  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But "everything" is a pretty vague idea.  No one wants to feel responsible for the death of a loved one.  If you ask someone, "do you want us to do everything or to let them die," the answer will usually be, "do everything."  End of life issues need to be addressed early and often.  We need to impress upon our patients that death is where we are all headed, and it can only be evaded for so long.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a patient once who had a history of kidney cancer.  She was supposed to get yearly CT scans to check for recurrences.  At the age of 76, she also had severe heart failure, but it rarely bothered her.  Still, heart failure like hers carries a high risk of dropping dead.  On one visit I asked her when her last CT for the cancer was.  She said, "do you really think I need it?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Well, if you have cancer in there, the scan will find it.  Removing it early can give you a lot more time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Doctor, you do realize that I'm not going to be alive to worry about it, don't you?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one likes to face mortality, but it's still there.  Part of health care reform must be "culture reform".   We need to remind ourselves that just because we can do something doesn't mean we should.  But how do we make these decisions?  How do we decide to withhold dialysis from someone?  Based on life-expectancy? Quality of life?  Religious preferences?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these questions has easy answers, but other countries have some pretty simple approaches.  They recognize that no matter how much you spend, no matter how much you do, everyone dies.  The death can come at home surrounded by family, or in the hospital sucking up resourced for futile care.  These choices aren't really as hard as they seem.  We have data to guide us, and quite honestly, if more Americans saw what goes on at the end of life in a hospital, we'd have a lot more empty beds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/are_we_insane.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/_buEHgA9WvQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247784273497"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/ben_stein_sinking_ever_lower.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19ec9ed08549fe5d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Ben Stein sinking ever lower</title><published>2009-07-16T22:42:24Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T22:42:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/l1IR2xxBkns/ben_stein_sinking_ever_lower.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/ben_stein_sinking_ever_lower.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Several people have notified me that this ugly mug is appearing in the ads on this site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/ben_stein_sinking_ever_lower/stein_ad.jpeg" width="400" height="160" alt="stein_ad.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, Ben Stein is hawking &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; credit reports on my site. Only…they aren&amp;#39;t free. They aren&amp;#39;t useful. And &lt;a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/07/16/ben-stein-predatory-bait-and-switch-merchant/"&gt;Ben Stein is being an exploitive douchebag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few points are worth noting here. First, the score itself is not very useful to consumers. What's useful is the report -- if there's an error on the report, then the consumer can try to rectify it. Secondly, and much more importantly, if you want a free credit report, there's only one place to go: &lt;a href="http://annualcreditreport.com"&gt;annualcreditreport.com&lt;/a&gt;. That's the place where the big three credit-rating agencies will give you a genuinely free copy of your credit report once a year, as required by federal law.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You won't be surprised to hear that freescore.com is not free: in order to get any information out of them at all, you have to authorize them to charge you a $29.95 monthly fee. They even extract a dollar out of you up front, just to make sure that money is there.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Stein, here, has become a predatory bait-and-switch merchant, dangling a "free" credit report in front of people so that he can sock them with a massive monthly fee for, essentially, doing nothing at all. Naturally, the people who take him up on this offer will be those who can least afford it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The level to which Stein has now sunk is more than enough reason -- as if the case for the prosecution weren't damning enough already -- for the NYT to cancel Stein's contract forthwith. It's simply unconscionable for a newspaper of record to employ as its "Everybody's Business" columnist someone who is surely making a vast amount of money by luring the unsuspecting into overpaying for a financial product they should under no circumstances buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who in their right mind would accept economic advice from Ben Stein, anyway?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/ben_stein_sinking_ever_lower.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/l1IR2xxBkns" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247783713655"><id gr:original-id="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2dff5d51da000b21</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">University of Central Lancashire stops its alternative medicine degrees (or does it?)</title><published>2009-07-16T22:21:41Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T22:21:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1899" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">.The University of Central Lancashire (UCLAN) is the first place I asked to see teaching materials that were used on its  homeopathy “BSc” course.

&lt;table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?s=central+lancashire"&gt;University of Central Lancashire&lt;/a&gt; (UCLAN) is the first place I asked to see teaching materials that were used on its  homeopathy “BSc” course.  The request was refused, and subsequent internal appeals were refused too, Clearly UCLAN had something to hide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.dcscience.net/uclan-logo.jpg" alt="UClan-logo"&gt;
  	&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal to the information commissioner took almost two years to be judged, but the case was won. &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1364"&gt;The eventual decision&lt;/a&gt; by the Information&lt;br&gt;
  Commissioner rejected all the grounds that UClan had used to evade the Freedom of Information Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UClan appealed against the judgement and I still haven’t got the stuff but that hardly matters now, because the course in question&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=249"&gt; shut its doors&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, plenty of stuff from similar courses &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?cat=231"&gt;has leaked out&lt;/a&gt; already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in September 2008, UCLAN&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=252"&gt; announced an internal review&lt;/a&gt; of all its courses in magic medicine, The review seemed to be genuine. For a start they asked me to give  evidence to the review (something that no other university has done). They also asked Michael Eslea to give evidence. He is the UCLAN psychologist, whose magnificent open letter probably tipped the authorities into holding the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case it is useful to anyone, here is a copy of the written evidence that I sent [&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/UCLAN_written_evidence-revised-131208.pdf"&gt;download pdf&lt;/a&gt;],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="+1"&gt;Report of the Working Party on the Review of issues associated with Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;        &lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of concerns expressed by some colleagues within the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) Dr Malcolm McVicar, Vice Chancellor appointed a working party to review the issues associated with the University offering courses in Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEMBERSHIP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eileen Martin (Chair)                 Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of Faculty of  Health and Social Care &lt;br&gt;
            Professor Gordon Bromage      Head of Centre for Astrophysics&lt;br&gt;
            Professor Malcolm Edmunds    Emeritus; Built and Natural Environment&lt;br&gt;
            Professor Doris Schroeder        Director of Centre for Professional Ethics&lt;br&gt;
            Elaine Austin                               Project Manager, Faculty of Health and Social Care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        &lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report was the subject of a special meeting of UCLAN’s Academic Board on 9th July 2009. The following resolutions were passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;table width="95%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R1           That further minor revisions be made to the report prior to publication on the University’s website; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R2   That the University refrain from offering any practitioner-qualifying courses in Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine until such disciplines have achieved statutory regulation status;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R3           That the University consider offering a limited number of postgraduate research studentships (leading to Masters by Research of PhD) to suitably qualified UCLan students and staff in these disciplines.  They should have interdisciplinary supervisory teams to facilitate development of a broad range of research skills and to contribute to the generation of knowledge in CAM;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R4          That the University consider how more interdisciplinary teaching can be achieved, where appropriate, within both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching to facilitate greater exposure to subject expertise and different paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Resolutions 1, 3 and 4 say very little.  Resolution 4 sounds thoroughly relativist. We are talking about medicine, about treating sick patients. There is only one “paradigm”.  That is to find treatments that are as effective and safe as possible. There aren’t two sorts of medicine, regular and alternative. There is just medicine that works and medicine that doesn’t work. It’s a good illustration of  DC’s rule number 2, “never trust anyone who uses the word paradigm”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution 2 is the really interesting one, because none if the topics,  Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine, is subject to statutory regulation. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If taken literally, resolution 2 means that all the UCLan courses in alternative medicine will close their doors. Bafflingly, this inevitable conclusion is not stated explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least resolution 2 means that homeopathy, already closed, will stay closed. It is never likely to get statutory regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For practical purposes, we can ignore for the moment the obvious fact that statutory regulation of nonsense subjects results only in nonsense. The only forms of alternative medicine that have got “statutory  regulation” at the moment are chiropractic and osteopathy.  The public has not been safeguarded by the General Chiropractic Council (GCC).  The GCC, on the contrary, has endangered the public by allowing  false health claims to be made with impunity. Perhaps the members of the review committee had not noticed that the Simon SIngh affair has resulted in almost 600 complaints being made to the GCC? The faith of the review in statutory regulation is clearly misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Pittilo report is critical for what happens next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine are not subject to statutory regulation at present, so  one would suppose that these degrees will close their doors too. However the infamous Pittilo report has proposed that they should become regulated by the Health Professions Council (HPC). The many problems of the Pittilo report have been documented here, in “&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235"&gt;A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor&lt;/a&gt;“.  There was also a high-profile critique of the report &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4628938.ece"&gt;in The Times&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=251"&gt;on this blog&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HPC has, as one of its criteria for regulation, “evidence-based practice”. Disgracefully, the HPC has already shown its willingness to ignore its own rules and to act as statutory regulator for Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal medicine. This rather disgraceful behaviour is documented in “H&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1284"&gt;ealth Professions Council ignores its own rules: the result is nonsense&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/uclan-CAM-report-15-July-09-final_publication.pdf"&gt;UCLAN report&lt;/a&gt; seems to assume that the recommendations of the Pittilo report will be accepted. But the long-awaited consultation has still not opened. We can be sure that when it does, the opposition to it will be very strong indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The report in full&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few comments on the report itself.    Download &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/uclan-CAM-report-15-July-09-final_publication.pdf"&gt;the full report&lt;/a&gt; (as of July 15th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have to say that when I visited Preston to &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/UCLAN_written_evidence-revised-131208.pdf" title="Written evidence"&gt;give evidence&lt;/a&gt;, my views seem to be treated seriously, even sympathetically, so it was a great disappointment to see the outcome. So what’s wrong? The major disaster is declared early in the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 2, Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debate is centred on a number of key themes which relate to:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  1. The quality of and/or absence of an evidence base to support claims of the efficacy and benefits of such treatments, linked to issues of public safety/protection and professional regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds good. What matters about any sort of medicine is whether or not it works and whether it is safe. It therefore verges on the incredible that we read in section 4.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“conclusions from research into the efficacy of the various CAM’s are outside the remit of this report.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point about CAM is that there is very little evidence that any of it works. So the review committee decided to ignore the most important problem of the lot.  I can’t see how any rational decision can be made without first deciding whether the treatment is better than placebo.  That, surely, is the main question, and it was dodged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UCLAN has failed to grasp the nettle, just as the Department of Health has also consistently failed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4,1  Efficacy&lt;/strong&gt;   This section repeats the assertion, absurd to my mind, that it is possible to judge CAM courses while declining to assess whether they work or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4.2 Role of Universities in Society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is universal agreement that critical thinking is crucial to the idea of a university, but the judgement of whether CAM teaches critical thinking is simply fudged. Again the report fails to grasp the nettle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;“Disagreements about critical thinking within CAMs arises because some will argue that such substantiation and assessment can occur within the discipline, whilst others will argue that the methodology for substantiation, that is evidence provision, is universal. As a result, the latter will demand that evidence is provided using methods from one field (e.g. randomised controlled trials) for use in another.”&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the report dodged the crucial judgement once again.  The most obvious characteristic of every form of alternative medicine is their total lack of critical self-appraisal.  It is very sad that the review committee could not bring itself to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section  4.4   Nomenclature of degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    The nomenclature of courses, leading to a professional as well as an academic award, should reflect the professional route; for example Bachelor with Honours in Complementary Medicine, B Comp. Med.(Hons) or B Acupuncture (Hons).
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds to me like another truly pathetic fudge.  What on earth is solved by changing the name of the degree?  You’d still be teaching  students the same load of gobbledygook and then letting them loose on sick people, whether you call it a Bachelor of Science, a Bachelor of Arts, or, as is recommended here, a Bachelor of nothing whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I suppose there is a (doubtless unintended) irony in calling CAM degrees “Bachelor of nothing whatsoever”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 4.4   Ethical, non-harm and economic considerations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section list a lot of reasons why teaching alternative medicine should be unethical. but nevertheless manages to conclude that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;” . . . it is not unethical to offer courses in Homeopathy, Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine at a university.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the logic by which this bizarre conclusion was reached quite impossible to follow.  Like much of the rest of the report this conclusion seems to stem from a reluctance to grapple with the really important questions, like ‘does it work or not?’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this the recommendation is perhaps the most interesting of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Recommendation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  • The University refrains from offering any CAM courses until such disciplines have achieved statutory regulation status.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recommendation was accepted, and passed as a resolution at Academic Board.  If it is implemented now, than there will be no more alternative medicine degrees next year at the University of Central Lancashire. If and when this happens, the University must be congratulated on its return to rational medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Eslea, UCLAN’s hero in resisting nonsense from the inside, has &lt;a href="http://punkpsychologist.blogspot.com/"&gt;posted on this topic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17 July 2009&lt;/strong&gt;.  It seemed odd that that no announcement was made about the future if the remaining CAM courses at UCLAN.  So I asked deputy Vice-Chancellor Patrick McGhee for clarification.  After a couple of days, I got this response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi David, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asked to respond to your question below on the running of acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine at UCLan.  It is correct to assume that UCLan will not be taking any new entrants onto these programmes until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Wishes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the report may have been disappointing, but it has done the job.  As several people have pointed out in comments, it would be asking too much to expect a university to say “sorry we just noticed that we have been running junk-science courses for years”.  But they have done the right thing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Colquhoun</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dcscience.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">DC&amp;#39;s Improbable Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.dcscience.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247780096635"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2595">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/56affaa4f2dc8946</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Congress says no to misleading autism information</title><published>2009-07-16T21:24:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T21:24:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/bDgcUU-fZwM/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247779749797"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/27_genes">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7c3ff161fb503f08</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">27 genes</title><published>2009-07-16T21:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T21:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/27_genes" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.tula.org/RESEARCH/GFP%20neuron.JPG" height="180" alt="Living neuron from http://www.tula.org/RESEARCH/GFP%20neuron.JPG" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="180"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's how many genes might be "associated with either Asperger Syndrome (AS) and/or autistic traits and/or empathy" according to a new study in the July 16th &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/116308170/home?CRETRY=1&amp;amp;SRETRY=0"&gt;Autism Research&lt;/a&gt;. Led by Dr &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/arc/staff_member.asp?id=47"&gt;Bhismadev Chakrabarti&lt;/a&gt; and Professor &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/arc/staff_member.asp?id=33"&gt;Simon Baron-Cohen&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/"&gt;Autism Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;, researchers   identified 68 genes because they were associated with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) neural growth&lt;br&gt;
(2) social behavior&lt;br&gt;
(3) sex steroid hormones (e.g. testosterone and estrogen)---these were chosen because of the higher incident of Asperger's in males than in females and because of &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/research/hormones.asp"&gt;research by the ARC about fetal testosterone levels&lt;/a&gt; and autistic traits and empathy in typically developing children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As described in yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090715101427.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;, the genes of 349 adults who had completed the &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/tests/aq_test.asp"&gt;Autism Spectrum Quotient&lt;/a&gt; (AQ) and the &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/tests/eq_test.asp"&gt;Empathy Quotient&lt;/a&gt; (EQ) were compared to those of 174 adults with a formal Asperger's diagnosis. The results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 27 out of the 68 genes were nominally associated with either AS and/or with autistic traits/empathy. 10 of these genes (such as CYP11B1) were involved with sex steroid function, providing support for the role of this class of genes in autism and autistic traits. 8 of these genes (such as NTRK1) were involved in neural growth, providing further support to the idea that autism and autistic traits could result from aberrant patterns of connectivity in the developing brain. The other 9 genes (such as OXTR) were involved in social behaviour, shedding light on the biology of social and emotional sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comment by Prof. Baron Cohen about why the study looked specifically at individuals with Asperger's Syndrome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We chose to look at the genetics of AS because all other genetic studies have focused on classic autism, which can include learning difficulties and language delay. AS is a more 'pure' condition because these other factors are absent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural functioning, social behavior, and hormones (specifically testosterone) are being pinpointed as particularly characteristic of Asperger's and, perhaps, of being on the autism spectrum. It's quite apparent that there is something different--dysfunctional, if you will---about my son's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/synapses_synesthesia_amp_genes"&gt;neurology&lt;/a&gt;; it's quite an understatement to say that he struggles socially. (I'll refrain from going into testosterone; certainly it's been a topic around here as my son is an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_time_of_perpetual_transitions_adolescence"&gt;adolescent&lt;/a&gt;.) His limited language/communication and cognitive abilities make testing and evaluation always a bit more of a challenge for Charlie, and also make it harder to figure out if he's not (for instance) responding because he doesn't understand a question, or because he can't retrieve the words quickly enough to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also seems to be the whiff of a suggestion here that neural functioning, social behavior, and hormones have something in particular to do with the autism spectrum. This is of interest in light of the proposed &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/musings_on_the_dsm-v_revisions_and_severity"&gt;revisions to the DSM&lt;/a&gt; regarding how autism is &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/collapsing_the_spectrum--and_expanding_it_again_dsm_considerations"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; with regard to "severity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;27 genes found, at least 20 more questions to ask.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247778201188"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/16/and-i-dream-im-an-eagle/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc7daedade3a2369</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">And I dream I’m an Eagle…</title><published>2009-07-16T20:30:10Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T20:30:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/16/and-i-dream-im-an-eagle/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The European Southern Observatory just released &lt;a href="http://www.eso.org/gallery/v/ESOPIA/Nebulae/phot-26a-09-hires.tif.html"&gt;this gorgeous image&lt;/a&gt; of the Eagle Nebula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Eagle is a sprawling cloud of gas and dust that is actively forming stars — it was made famous by &lt;a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap070218.html"&gt;the Hubble image&lt;/a&gt; of the dark clouds in the center which were called The Pillars of Creation. This ESO image was taken with a 2.2 meter telescope in Chile, and covers an impressive area of the sky equal to the size of the full Moon! The colors here are false, the image is in the near infrared (though the press release does not state what other filters were used, frustratingly [UPDATE: I have been informed by an inside source that the filters used were blue, visible (yellowish), near-IR, and one that just lets through a specific wavelength strongly emitted by hydrogen, called Hα]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nebula is 7000 light years away, but easily visible in small telescopes. I remember observing it when I was a lad, using my 25 cm telescope. It was just a fuzzy blob through the eyepiece, competing with the street light down the block a bit (which was octillions of times fainter but a hundred trillion times closer). It just goes to show you what you can do with the right equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And remember as you pass you eyes over the lovely sheets and filaments of gas in the Eagle: you’re seeing stars in the very act of being born, some with their cores just beginning to fuse hydrogen into helium, others still a million years away from that, and others yet already stable stars and well on their way to exploding as supernovae. It’s birth, life, and death, all against a gloriously displayed background of gas dynamics and quantum mechanics writ large. &lt;/p&gt;

And a good thing, too, because it usually takes at least half a dozen emails before I will do anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1964, Richard Feynman gave the Messenger Lectures at Cornell, aimed at a general audience.  They were later collected into &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Character-Physical-Messenger-Lectures-1964/dp/0262560038/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Character of Physical Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a great little book with a depressingly boring cover.  Feynman-worship is often overdone, but man, the guy could lecture.  And he knew a lot about physics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that Bill Gates has now put the full video of the lectures online, as part of &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/tools/tuva/"&gt;Project Tuva&lt;/a&gt;.  I had to update some software to view them on my Mac, but it seems to be working now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecture Five is about the arrow of time.  If you skip ahead to the 18th minute or so, you’ll hear Feynman explain the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/12/29/richard-feynman-on-boltzmann-brains/"&gt;Boltzmann Brain&lt;/a&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247777255596"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/6vvoLkuixbg/music_participation_doesnt_app.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e2e1ecf0394b3e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Music participation doesn&amp;#39;t appear to diminish performance in other schoolwork</title><published>2009-07-16T15:57:09Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T15:57:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/6mCBS9A0qZQ/music_participation_doesnt_app.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~3/6vvoLkuixbg/music_participation_doesnt_app.php"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_mid.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When school budgets are cut, programs in music and the arts are often the first to get axed. While this makes a certain amount of sense because music isn't always considered "essential" to education, recently in the U.S. we're starting to see another justification for cutting music out of schools. The No Child Left Behind Act demands that students meet a certain basic level of academic success, or a school's budget can be cut. "Extras" like music classes and recess only distract from the primary goals of learning English, math, science, and history, some say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does music participation actually cause students to do worse in the core academic subjects? Some studies have found the opposite, with kids' IQ scores &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2005/06/music_and_iq.php"&gt;improving&lt;/a&gt; after a year of music lessons. Other studies have found that students who participate in music tend to have higher grades and test scores in other subjects. This, however, is only a correlation--we don't know if music &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; the improvement. Kids in music classes might be better in other subjects just because better students are more likely to take music classes. Maybe these kids would do even better in school if they weren't distracted by music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Miksza took a look at data from the 1988 National Educational Longitudinal Study to see if he could find stronger evidence of the impact of music on performance in school. He analyzed the records of 5,335 students who either participated in school music programs from 8th through 12th grade or did not participate at all (students who participated only part of the time were excluded from the analysis). Here are some of the results:&lt;/p&gt;

But one of the things you may have heard a lot lately is that women don't "need" a period, or even that it is "useless." I'd like to spend a little time unpacking this in the second part of my series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is normal?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, in the beginning of an evolutionary medicine volume, I read in the editors’ opening comments that there is “nothing biologically normal” about monthly menses, as a way to put forward the idea that women should take continuous oral contraceptives (Stearns and Koella 2008, p. 4). Nothing biologically normal? Whether we like it or not, frequent menses in the United States is biologically normal, due to the fact that we eat a lot and don’t move around much at all. We’re at the far end of the spectrum of variation in reproductive function, but we have not fallen off the end of the continuum. On the one hand, I appreciate the attempt of the authors to try to shake things up and introduce the possibility that American physiology is not the global standard, but any body that responds appropriately to its ecology is, by definition, normal. Does this appropriate and evolutionary response to environment have its own consequences? Yes; you can lay the blame for the increased incidence of reproductive cancers in developed countries mostly on the flexible responsiveness and resource allocation capabilities of our reproductive systems. Your genes are important in determining your chances of breast cancer, but so are cumulated years of cheese fries and driving to work. (And before you think this is some sort of diatribe against overweight folks, plenty of normal weight folks – normal for Americans – have more unhealthy eating patterns than overweight folks. It’s not how you look but how you live, even when in broad strokes evidence can initially suggest it’s about the weight one carries.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is the reason Stearns and Koella (2008), and Eaton (Eaton et al. 1994; Eaton et al. 2002), and others have been advocating continuous hormonal contraceptive use: it may decrease reproductive cancer rates. Let’s take a step back and first understand the context under which the human female reproductive system evolved: once upon a time we were eating less and moving more. Age at menarche (that’s when we get our first menstrual period) used to be much later, menses itself wasn’t particularly heavy or cumbersome, and few cycles were ovulatory (meaning that an egg is released for possible fertilization). Soon after reaching menarche (as in, within a few years) a woman has her first child. She breastfeeds intensively for the first few years, but continues to breastfeed at least occasionally for four years, maybe more. At some point towards the end of breastfeeding, or sometimes not even until breastfeeding was done, she would resume cycling, and in a few cycles likely get pregnant again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This pattern would continue, with some variations based on miscarriages, increasing age, seasonal variation in food availability, and other issues, until the woman hit menopause. Of course, for many women, their lives ended around that point or even before, but some number of women certainly survived to be grandmothers, if observation of current forager populations is any indication. This means that for most of a woman’s reproductive life she was pregnant or breastfeeding, and cycling only occasionally. Strassmann has a great analysis of this and comparison between populations (Strassmann 1997): the punchline is that an industrialized woman of today has around 400 menstrual cycles, while our ancestors, if modern foragers are an indication, had 50-100.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now let’s look at today’s industrialized, or developed-country woman: like men, she eats more and moves around less, largely because she is in school or working rather than getting her own food. She hits menarche earlier, and menses are more frequent and copious than her ancestors, which creates lots of tissue remodeling in the endometrium (the lining of the uterus). Many of her cycles are ovulatory, necessitating frequent tissue remodeling for the ovaries. She may cycle for years before having her first child, even decades, and with those frequent cycles come a higher exposure to endogenous (coming from within the body rather than a pill) sex steroids like estradiol and progesterone. Even if she breastfeeds for years, she will likely resume menstrual cycling sooner than her ancestors because she is better fed. She will probably have fewer pregnancies and births than her ancestors, which means more cycles in between pregnancies. She will most likely make it to menopause and beyond; because she is so much more likely to make it past menopause we are far more likely to notice the negative effects of all that hormone exposure, in the form of reproductive cancers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So while I disagree with the idea that there is “nothing biologically normal” about frequent menstrual cycles, I certainly agree that they are not doing us any favors. But is it the reproductive system that is at fault or the lifestyle? Should we artificially suppress the system in order to promote health, or make changes to the way we live? I’m sure the answer lies somewhere in between, at least as we move towards building more sustainable neighborhoods and taking better care of our environment in developed countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third part of this series will address population variation in reproductive function, and how this impacts the efficacy and side effect incidence of hormonal contraceptives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;References&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Quarterley+Review+of+Biology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Women%27s+reproductive+cancers+in+evolutionary+context&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=1994&amp;amp;rft.volume=69&amp;amp;rft.issue=3&amp;amp;rft.spage=353&amp;amp;rft.epage=367&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Eaton+SB&amp;amp;rft.au=Pike+MC&amp;amp;rft.au=Short+RV&amp;amp;rft.au=Lee+NC&amp;amp;rft.au=Trussell+J&amp;amp;rft.au=Hatcher+RA&amp;amp;rft.au=Wood+JW&amp;amp;rft.au=Worthman+CM&amp;amp;rft.au=Blurton-Jones+NG&amp;amp;rft.au=Konner+MJ&amp;amp;rft.au=Hill+KR&amp;amp;rft.au=Bailey+R&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Anthropology%2CHealth%2CBiological+Anthropology%2C+Medicine"&gt;Eaton SB, Pike MC, Short RV, Lee NC, Trussell J, Hatcher RA, Wood JW, Worthman CM, Blurton-Jones NG, Konner MJ, Hill KR, &amp;amp; Bailey R (1994).

Let’s call her… Bob.  Bob’s an engineer and she’s religious.  At some point, conversation turned to God (I swear, it always does when I’m around…) and I mentioned that I’d been reading a &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/chris-mooney-and-sheril-kirshenbaum-in.html"&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/13/pz-myers-vs-unscientific-america-part-i/"&gt;forth&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;strong&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum&lt;/strong&gt;’s new book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens our Future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors make a claim that &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/206609/output/print"&gt;scientists hurt their own cause&lt;/a&gt; when they say you can’t be both scientific and religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to support what Mooney and Kirshenbaum say.  It’d be great it that were true, because it opens the door for extremely religious people to also share in the joy of science.  My friend, who doesn’t get involved in a lot of religious debate, thought their position was obviously right.  She believes in God, and she accepts science.  She wondered: Why is that so hard to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about the virgin birth? I asked.  That’s an example of something that directly contradicts what we know about &lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/07/how-to-make-baby.html"&gt;how babies are made&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob said that was true… but she didn’t really believe in the whole virgin birth thing.  Crisis averted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about Jesus resurrecting himself three days after he died?  Surely, that goes against anything science has shown us about the nature of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob wasn’t sure about that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she wasn’t about to let go of the God concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s really the gist of the argument.  Ultimately, if you think good science can be trusted to predict what’s going to happen in certain situations (and what happened in the past), then you can’t accept that God will intervene.  That would undermine everything we know about science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you reconcile the two?  By compartmentalizing faith and science, treating them with different gloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why people like &lt;strong&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/strong&gt; can accept evolution while believing God started the whole process.  He believe in different kinds of evidence — one that involves logic and reason and another that I guess involves whatever makes you feel happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M &amp;amp; K offer this suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The public’s willingness to reject science for religious reasons is certainly lamentable. But by arguing that science contradicts religion and makes it untenable, many atheists reinforce the very concerns that are keeping people from accepting science to begin with….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A far better approach is to work with religious believers to help them separate their personal religion from everybody’s shared science, and move toward a much needed middle ground.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they’re right in one point… if we say science contradicts religion, it does indeed make it difficult for the religious to accept science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s their loss, not ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we can bend over backwards to show them ways the two areas can reconcile, we’ve already gone too far.  At some point, we have to be able to say that there’s no evidence that God plays any role in the world as we know it, no evidence that Biblical notions of Creation and miracles are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s virtually impossible to find a “middle ground” because religious people constantly want to draw the line further into the realm of science — where it doesn’t belong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Intelligent Design proponents, “shared science” includes the notion that evolution is bunk.  They’re not about to accept that it’s just part of their “personal religion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If M &amp;amp; K really want their book to have an impact, here’s what they should do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop going to bookstores for the book tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to churches instead.  (Good luck getting invited.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the case that Christians ought to embrace science and explain what that entails — acceptance of evolution, climate change, and the age of the earth, to name a few.  Tell them that it’s possible to believe in God and those scientific concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what the response is like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to avoid getting lynched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they can do that successfully a few times, I’ll take them more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when that doesn’t go well, it’s not the fault of pro-science/anti-religion advocates like &lt;strong&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt;.  I guarantee most evangelicals have never heard of either.  The problem is that scientific facts contradict popular religious beliefs, and the other side is not about to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt an army of &lt;strong&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/strong&gt;s and other great science communicators can fix that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Are you a student (undergrad or grad) who is doing research that aligns with skeptical goals? Then the JREF wants to send you money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, the James Randi Educational Foundation gives away $10,000 total divided into four academic scholarships to deserving students. You can learn all you need to know &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-scholarships.html"&gt;on the JREF scholarship page&lt;/a&gt;. Applications are accepted from students both domestic and foreign, and the field of study is not limited either as long as it aligns with the criteria listed on that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of the things that confused my when I started reading about chaos is easy to
explain using what we've covered about attractors. &lt;em&gt;(The image to the side was created by Jean-Francois Colonna, and is part of his slide-show &lt;a href="http://www.lactamme.polytechnique.fr/Mosaic/descripteurs/AVirtualSpaceTimeTravelMachine.Ang.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Here's the problem: We know that things like &lt;a href="http://faculty.ifmo.ru/butikov/Projects/Collection6.html"&gt;N-body gravitational systems are chaotic&lt;/a&gt; - and a common example of that is how a gravity-based orbital system that appears stable for a long time can suddenly go through a transition where one body is violently ejected, with enough velocity to permanently escape the orbital system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But when we look at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/06/chaos.php"&gt;the definition of chaos&lt;/a&gt;, we see the requirement for dense periodic orbits.  But if a body is ejected from a gravitational system,  ejection of a body from a gravitational system is a demonstration of chaos, how can that system have periodic orbits? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/chaotic_systems_and_escape.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/chaotic_systems_and_escape.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/NWM715wWuC8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247774131022"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/very_off_topic_why_i_wont_be_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/724b6babae5a5814</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chatter"/><title type="html">Very off topic: Why I won't be at my high school reunion</title><published>2009-07-16T16:45:57Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T16:45:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/h8-Y7kYTVsk/very_off_topic_why_i_wont_be_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/very_off_topic_why_i_wont_be_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; This comment thread has gotten long enough to start causing some server
load problems. As a result, I'm closing the comments here, and I've added &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/high_school_reunion_new_commen.php"&gt;a new
post where discussions of this past can continue.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; If you're not interested in completely off-topic personal rambling, stop reading now. This is very off-topic. But I wanted to say this once, and I wanted to do it in a way where I had some control over the publicly viewable responses. I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be following my usual commenting guidelines here - anything which I consider to be abusive will be deleted, with no warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I graduated from high school in 1984. Which means that this year is my graduating
class's 25th year reunion. As a result, a bunch of people from my high school class have been trying to friend me on facebook, sending me email, and trying to convince me to come to the reunion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I don't feel like replying to them individually, which is why I'm writing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As pretty much any reader of this blog who isn't a total idiot must have figured out by now, I'm a geek. I have been since I was a kid. My dad taught me about bell curves and standard deviations when I was in third grade, and I thought it was pretty much the coolest damn thing I'd ever seen. That's the kind of kid I was. I was also very small - 5 foot 1 when I started high school, 5 foot three my junior year. Even when I shot up in height, to nearly 5 foot eleven between junior and senior year, I weighed under 120 pounds. So think small, skinny, hyperactive, geek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Like most geek kids, I had a rough time in school. I don't think that my experience was particularly unusual. I know a lot of people who had it worse. But I think that it was slightly worse than average, because the administration in the school system that I went to tolerated an extraordinary amount of violent bullying. Almost every geeky kid gets socially ostracized. Almost all get mocked. In fact, almost all face some physical abuse. The main determinant of just how &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; physical abuse they get subjected to is the school administration. And the administration at my school really didn't care: "Bruises? He must just be uncoordinated and bumps into things. Broken fingers? Hey, it happens. We're sure it must have been an accident. What do you want, an armed guard to follow your kid around?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In high school, I didn't have a single real friend in my graduating class. I had a
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few friends who graduated a year before me; I had a few who graduated one or two years after me. But being absolutely literal, there was not a single person in my graduating class who came &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to treating me like a friend.  Not one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Like I said before, the way I was by my classmates in high school was pretty typical for a geek. At best, I was ignored. At worst, I was beaten. In between, I was used as a sort of status enhancer: telling people that you'd seen me doing some supposedly awful or hysterical thing was a common scheme for getting ahead in certain social circles. In the most extreme case, someone painted a swastika onto the street in front of my house with gasoline, and lit it. (In autumn, in a wooded neighborhood.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; I'm can't even pretend that I wasn't an easy target, or that I didn't respond in a way that encouraged my tormentors. I was a hyperactive geek. My social skills were awful. I don't think that I &lt;em&gt;deserved&lt;/em&gt; the way that I was treated; but at the same time, I do think that my hyperactivity and my lack of social skills both helped make me such a good target, and discouraged anyone from intervening on my behalf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But I don't think that that excuses anyone who abused me. It doesn't excuse the
bastards who made up stories about me. It doesn't justify the people who threw me against walls. It doesn't explain the guy who broke my fingers, because he wanted to know what it would sound like. And it doesn't absolve the people who watched, and &lt;em&gt;laughed&lt;/em&gt; while that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Now it's twenty five years since I got out of  that miserable fucking hell-hole. And people from my high school class are suddenly getting in touch, sending me email, trying to friend me on Facebook, and trying to convince me to bring my family to the reunion. (It's a picnic reunion, full family invited.) Even some of the people who used to beat the crap out of me on a regular basis are getting in touch as if we're old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; My reaction to them... What the fuck is wrong with you people? Why would you think that I would want to have anything to do with you? How do you have the &lt;em&gt;chutzpah&lt;/em&gt; to act as if we're old friends? How &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; you? I see the RSVP list that one of you sent me, and I literally feel nauseous just remembering your names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The only positive thing that ever came out of my time with you people is that my children are studying karate. My son will, most likely, have his black belt by the time he finishes fourth grade. He's a hyperactive little geek, just like me. He'll probably go through some social grief, just like I did. But when some fucker like one of you tries to lay a hand on him or one of his friends, he'll beat the living crap out of them. One of the mantras that his karate school follows is: Never start a fight, but if a fight starts, always be the one to finish it. And that's what he'll be able to do. To definitively finish any fight that anyone starts with him in a way that will teach his abusers and their cohorts to &lt;em&gt;stay the fuck away&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And that's all that I want from you. Stay the fuck away from me. I don't want to hear about your lives. I don't want to know how you've changed since high school. I don't want to hear about your jobs, your spouses, your children. I've got a good life now,
and I cannot imagine a reason in the world why I would pollute that world with contact with any of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/very_off_topic_why_i_wont_be_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/h8-Y7kYTVsk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247773398647"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/thursday_sprog_art.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3f0202ce606d68e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Critters"/><title type="html">Thursday sprog art.</title><published>2009-07-16T19:41:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T19:41:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/PiwSUF9UtdQ/thursday_sprog_art.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/thursday_sprog_art.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I thrash my way through composing my last anticipated post on &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;, I reckoned it was time to give you some more pictures to go with all the words.

There are no roads to Churchill, so the options are to fly or to drive to Thompson and take the train.  One student and I flew, while three others drove with the supplies for our group and the upcoming field course and then came the rest of the way by train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl9ybKODdWI/AAAAAAAAAtM/Wbl5WH4V2w0/s1600-h/c2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:205px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl9ybKODdWI/AAAAAAAAAtM/Wbl5WH4V2w0/s400/c2.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday we spent unpacking our equipment and then in the afternoon we had our bear safety orientation and firearms training.  Being in polar bear country requires taking steps to keep researchers and students as safe as possible.  This includes preventive action like working in groups and having someone on bear watch at all times.  Those of us with licenses will also be on bear guard much of the time, carrying shotguns as a last resort means of protection.  As such, it was good to get out and practice some shooting with the experts from the station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl9wwTDbLYI/AAAAAAAAAs8/Bxt7r5eNP18/s1600-h/c1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl9wwTDbLYI/AAAAAAAAAs8/Bxt7r5eNP18/s400/c1.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl9w0Ti5MlI/AAAAAAAAAtE/f2naAB70aR0/s1600-h/c3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl9w0Ti5MlI/AAAAAAAAAtE/f2naAB70aR0/s400/c3.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, like the last two days, it was cold (5 C) and rainy, but we got out for a little bit of collecting this morning and found some specimens from various taxa we're focusing on.  The real collecting will begin once the weather gets warmer and when the rest of the researchers and students come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have two large liquid nitrogen vapour shippers for our specimens, and lots of collecting implements.  Basically, we are after everything that moves and even stuff that doesn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No polar bear sightings yet, but we did watch a pod of belugas this morning for a few minutes. Some of the students are eager to get out in the boats for some marine dredging, but the bay is still full of ice floes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl_IWeMRGpI/AAAAAAAAAtU/MOhfhBw3u6E/s1600-h/c5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:400px;height:300px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_KQSgvOOpF1I/Sl_IWeMRGpI/AAAAAAAAAtU/MOhfhBw3u6E/s400/c5.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stay tuned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;_______&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/07/churchill-fieldwork-series.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the Churchill fieldwork posts.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-3713562893290474556?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/3j7mL8hp53w" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247773143866"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3202">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f52ff54989227689</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="grasping reflex"/><category term="vestigial trait"/><category term="Why Evolution is true"/><title type="html">The vestigial grasp of infants</title><published>2009-07-16T18:58:46Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T18:58:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/the-vestigial-grasp-of-infants/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt; there is a chapter on vestigial traits, defined as those traits that are evolutionary remnants of features useful in an ancestor, but now either useless or used in a different way.  The paradigmatic case is, of course, the appendix, the remnant of a caecal pouch used to digest leaves and vegetation in our ancestors. But behaviors can be vestigial, too.  One such behavior is the “grasping reflex” of human infants.  When you put your finger into the palm of an infant, it will immediately and securely grasp it.  The grasp is so tight that it’s sometimes hard to make the kid let go!  It is said — though I have never seen this demonstrated — that up to a couple months of age a baby can hang suspended from a horizontal stick for several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grasping reflex is evident in the feet, too. If you put your finger along a baby’s toes from the sole side, it will grasp with those toes.  And when a baby is sitting down, its “prehensile” feet assume a curled-in posture, much like what we see in an infant or an adult chimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my friends has a four-month-old daughter, and I asked her to take a picture of the grasping reflex and the prehensile foot posture for this website.  Here are both in a single picture.  Although the kid is somnolent, she still holds on firmly.  The sitting posture of a young chimp is given for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="grasping instinct" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/grasping-instinct.jpg?w=400&amp;amp;h=459" alt="grasping instinct" width="400" height="459"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Chimp sitting 9" src="http://whyevolutionistrue.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/chimp-sitting-9.jpg?w=406&amp;amp;h=562" alt="Chimp sitting 9" width="406" height="562"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do infants show this grasping reflex, but then lose it after several months?  A very plausible suggestion is that the behavior is a remnant of the grasping reflex seen in other infant primates, which they use to hold on to the hair of their mothers as they’re being carried about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to encourage my readers to suspend their newborns from broomsticks in the cause of evolution (they could fall, after all), but if you’re sufficiently curious and foolhardy to do this, let me know the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the anonymous mom who donated her child to science.&lt;/p&gt;

As a species, we went from throwing rocks at the moon in the night sky, to worshiping it, to observing it, to tracking it, to standing on its surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pantheon of human adventure stories and feats of exploration, the moon landing ranks as high as any. It’s a testament to not only our curiosity and our desire to know and experience, but to our ability to achieve and our industriousness in the face of the seemingly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today’s AI, embrace the spirit of adventure that took us to the moon. Stretch out your mind across all that we know and perceive. Let your thoughts play even in the bulk beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What siren song do you hear? What calls you and ignites your curiosity? What prods you most to explore? What adventures dance in your imagination?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He has been  a long-time critic of biblical scholars who claim that there is more history in the Bible than there is.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; His work is one of the inspirations for my book, &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The End of Biblical Studies&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (EOBS), which argues that the field of biblical studies is still permeated by religionist biases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But, although Davies may agree with me on some major issues,  he says he disagrees with me on the notion of ending biblical studies. He has expressed his opinion in his review of my book in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Journal of Theological Studies&lt;/span&gt; 60:1 (2009):214-219.  He has also posted a related item at &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Bible and Interpretation&lt;/span&gt; blogsite---  &lt;a href="http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/whose.shtml"&gt;Philip Davies’ post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There already is a response to Davies at &lt;span style="color:black"&gt;&lt;a href="http://missivesfrommarx.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/biblical-literacy-and-christian-privilege/"&gt;Missives from Marx &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;      &lt;br&gt; Here, I will respond briefly to some of Prof. Davies' observations (quoted in bold italics and numbered in no particular order for convenience). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;1. “It may be relevant in ways that we don’t like, but the last thing that the situation calls for is to stop studying it, and its effects, critically.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Davies seems to misunderstand what I mean by “the end” of biblical studies.  On. p. 341 of EOBS, I clearly state that I don’t want to stop studying the Bible.  I want to end THE WAY the Bible is studied. In fact, I provide three scenarios on that page:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) Eliminate biblical studies completely from the modern world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Retain biblical studies as is, but admit that it is a religionist enterprise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Retain biblical studies, but redefine its purpose so that it is tasked with eliminating completely the influence of the Bible in the modern world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I stated there that I do not advocate the first option, at least for the moment, because I do believe that the Bible should be studied, if only as a lesson in why human beings should not privilege such books again. My objection has been to the religionist and bibliolatrous purpose for which it is studied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The second option is actually what is found in most seminaries, but we must advertise that scholars in all of academia are doing the same thing, though they are not being very open and honest about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I prefer the third option. The sole purpose of biblical studies, under this option, would be to help people move toward a postscriptural society. The third option is also the most logical position, given the discovery of the Bible’s alien character. This scenario also calls for studying the "effects" of the Bible, just as Davies suggests we ought to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;2. “Avalos’s criticisms of both the Bible and biblical scholarship are valid enough (and well known to most scholars, too); but his conclusion and his suggested remedy are nonsensical. It would leave the Bible with little function or value other than to serve as Christian and Jewish scripture, to be studied (in whatever fashion) only by the faithful—who, he says, do not and cannot properly read or understand it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Not under my option 3 above.  If our task, as biblical scholars, is to end THE INFLUENCE (or what remains of it) of the Bible in the modern world, then there should be no function or value left to the Bible anymore than there is to Homer’s &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Iliad&lt;/span&gt; in modern society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;3. “But in assuming that the relevance of the Bible to the modern world is purely ethical Avalos allies himself precisely with this constituency&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  But I do not assume that the relevance of the Bible to the modern world is “purely ethical.” In fact, Davies quotes my sentence where I define biblical irrelevance as follows: “a biblical concept or practice that is no longer viewed as valuable, applicable and/or ethical.” So, I list THREE items here (valuable, applicable, and/or ethical), and now he has reduced it to one (ethical).  By “valuable” I also include literary aesthetics, or the claim that the Bible is more beautiful than other books, and that we should privilege it for that reason. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;4. “Yet Avalos’s criticism of the Bible is directed not at its aesthetics, but its morality, which most literary criticism would regard as beside the point.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Not quite. I devote pages 237-240 to explaining why we cannot always divorce aesthetics from ethics. I explained that there is a whole philosophical school that argues that we cannot necessarily divorce ethics from aesthetics.  I gave a few examples of how often biblical episodes of violence were extolled for their literary quality, thereby deflecting attention from the violence endorsed therein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;5. “What we need is not the end of biblical scholarship but more of its critical engagement with the public (mis)use of the Bible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; That is not much different from my option 3: Retain biblical studies, but redefine its purpose so that it is tasked with eliminating completely the influence of the Bible in the modern world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I argued precisely that what biblical scholars are not doing sufficiently is informing the world that the Bible is not relevant. It is partly the fact that biblical scholars largely hide the Bible's irrelevance that makes people think it is relevant. That false sense of relevance is what allows the Bible to be misused more than any other work from antiquity. By the end of the process I envision, the Bible will be just as relevant as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;The Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;6. “‘Why not extend our thesis to all ancient literature?’ asks Avalos (p. 24), and wonders whether he might be suspected of what he sees as typical American ‘anti-intellectualism’. Allowing that he could extend his critique, he explains that he is concentrating on the ‘most egregious and historically important example.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I explained, however, that people usually don’t kill other people because of  misinterpretations of Hamlet or almost any ancient work we can name. That does make the Bible different.  That is also why it is particularly important to reduce the Bible to the importance of Homer or the E&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;pic of Gilgamesh&lt;/span&gt; in the modern world.  It is not that Homer should be MORE important, but rather that we should work to expose the fact that the Bible should be as EQUALLY relevant as T&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;he Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/span&gt; or Homer's &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Iliad&lt;/span&gt; are today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Throughout Davies’ commentary there is the sense that somehow Western civilization will be less fulfilling without biblical literacy.  He cites figures on how illiterate modern people are about the Bible. An acute answer to Davies’ plea for his type of biblical literacy is given by Craig Martin (and quoted in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Missives from Marx&lt;/span&gt;), in his commentary on Stephen Prothero’s  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Religious Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know---And Doesn’t &lt;/span&gt;(2007):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Prothero’s grave concern about religious illiteracy seems to be invalidated—or at least attenuated—by his own argument. On the one hand, he argues that Americans don’t know much about religion anymore and, on the other hand, that this ignorance prevents them from understanding religious references in popular culture, political speeches, etc. However, if people don’t know much about religion, won’t those references slowly disappear, in which case there’s no need to worry about the matter? There is a part of me that wants to summarize Prothero’s central concern like this: “Americans don’t any longer know about this important part of their culture that’s no longer important.” This formulation is unfair—Prothero’s argument is not this superficial—but I think that there is something to it that is right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, it seems as if Davies himself realizes that most people are not reading the Bible. We, biblical scholars, just have to help those that are still reading it realize that it is no more more relevant than many other ancient works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;7. ...Hector Avalos, the only non-religious scholar I know of that actually seems to hate the Bible...”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As has been pointed out at &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Missives from Marx&lt;/span&gt;, Davies must surely mean “the only non-religious BIBLICAL scholar.” However, this characterization of my position is not quite correct. I certainly do not like any book that endorses genocide, misogyny, etc. However, if I hate anything, it is the WAY that the Bible is being used. Otherwise, I don’t hate the Bible anymore than I hate the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Epic of Gilgamesh&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In any case, Philip Davies is still my hero. I am one of “the monsters” that he has helped to spawn, whether he takes credit for it or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-6912243432177734342?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The safe was taken from the home.  Seven bad guys were arrested, and found to have a very large stash of weapons.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who has a safe full of stuff worth a home invasion and multiple murder to get?  Is this something from a film that spilled over into real life? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE:  This is very funny.  I was just watching MSNBC and I think I figured something out.  It was teh safe itself, not the contents, that the arrested bad guys were after.  Maybe an antique, maybe historically significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I'll add this: Whatever the explanation is, it is quirky. Strange.  Unexpected.  &lt;/p&gt;

Not that he heeded our call or anything, but he’s gonna step down.  Let’s hope this leads the whole ghastly foundation to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an article in the latest &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090715/full/460310a.html"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BioLogos Foundation has confirmed that Collins would step down from his role there before taking up the reins at the NIH. It’s the right move, says Varmus. “Discussion about the foundation and his involvement with it could readily become a distraction from the business of running the NIH,” he told &lt;span&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As soon as it is out I'll let you know.  The first set of stories will interest you, and includes an interview with PZ Myers.  The second set will include an interview with Yours Truly.  But other than those two blemishes, the podcasts really are quite good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, we are currently planning a podcast production which I can't give you details of but it involves Genie Scott of the National Center for Science Education and me.  That should be fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it is no secret that the Minnesota Atheists Talk Radio Show, of 9:00 AM on Sunday Morning fame, is no longer running.  I had the honor of being the last guest.  No, it is not true that I was a guest and then someone heard the show and said "OMG, this sucks!  We gotta shut this done!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the plan has been to shut down the radio show and start up a podcast instead.  MN Atheists members and friends have been contacted and invited to a meeting to discuss this, and the meeting is tonight.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any input, it would be much appreciated!?!? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you listen to podcasts?  Would you listen to ours?  What kinds of things should we talk about?  Should there be video?  How can we make this an excellent project?  What should we avoid?  &lt;/p&gt;

Today, many are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook statistics show that this past year has seen a huge influx of people, globally, of roughly my age who are not techies or bloggers, just normal people. Over the past 5-6 years, Facebook has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/the_evolution_of_facebook.php" title=""&gt;evolved and changed&lt;/a&gt; quite a lot. Some of the best and most liked functionalities on Facebook right now are blatant copies of the &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/2009/03/30/plos-one-on-twitter-and-friendfeed/" title=""&gt;best aspects&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/coturnix" title=""&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BoraZ" title=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/coturnix" title=""&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/coturnix1" title=""&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/Coturnix" title=""&gt;Dopplr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/1/43/808" title=""&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and other services (some of which are now already dead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As us oldsters are joining in great numbers, there is a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/10/the_generation_clash_on_facebo.php" title=""&gt;clash of generations&lt;/a&gt; as we use Facebook differently &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/03/the_socalled_facebook_scandal.php" title=""&gt;than the kids do&lt;/a&gt; and they feel like we are encroaching on their territory (thus learning how to use the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/how_to_use_the_facebook_privac.php" title=""&gt;privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; is the key).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless Google Wave kills off all the competition, Facebook will remain the main and the biggest &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/07/facebook_news_and_my_views.php" title=""&gt;central place&lt;/a&gt; for people of all generations to find each other, have fun, or do business. Just like it did for college and high school kids five years ago, and for the techies and bloggers about a year later, Facebook is now introducing everyone to the wonders of Web 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of my 1,161 friends on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/coturnix" title=""&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I use it for PR and not just for finding old friends), you have noticed I friended a lot of people with Serbian-sounding names over the past year or so. Yup, those are old friends from school: preschool, elementary/middle school, high school and vet school. And by finding each other on Facebook, and through using Facebook as a tool, we organized, for the first time in many years, to meet in person in Belgrade last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have also seen me tagged in a bunch of pictures from those reunions - check out the photo sets &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=28033&amp;amp;id=1041299642&amp;amp;ref=mf" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=27275&amp;amp;id=1017689582&amp;amp;ref=mf" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2016199&amp;amp;id=1116743091&amp;amp;ref=mf" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2016179&amp;amp;id=1196645040&amp;amp;ref=mf" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2029356&amp;amp;id=1371965304&amp;amp;ref=mf" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (that's uploaded so far - there may be more soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it an anniversary of graduation? No. Did we meet as a single coherent class of people sharing the same classroom? No. I went to three such parties on three consecutive nights in Belgrade last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One meetup was just a few of us from the last two years of high school (nobody brought the camera, alas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second meetup was organized over just a few days - it started on Facebook as I told some friends I'd be in Belgrade and would like to meet. They then contacted some others via phone or personal contact in physical space, we chose the venue (the ancient restaurant "Manjez" - yes, the name comes from 'manege' as that was the place where King's horses were stabled and trained a century ago) and whoever could show up showed up. Eighteen of us got together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="reunion at Manjez.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/reunion%20at%20Manjez.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them I met last year when I was in Belgrade. Others I have not seen in 20 or 25 or even 32 years. Only two I had to ask for the name. Some I recognized by the walk as they approached the restaurant. Others did not change in their faces at all. Others I recognized once they started talking. Most of us were in the same class in elementary school (1-4th grade), with some I was also in the same school later, including high school, and with one I was even in the same preschool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone remembered anecdotes from those old days, many brought photographs, year-books and class pictures. We wondered about people nobody's heard from in years (one of them just e-mailed me two days ago completely out of the blue: he just googled my name). Two of our friends, I heard, died in the meantime (one of them as a conscript in the war between Serbia and Croatia in the early 1990s). Then we walked over to the old high school yard, where I saw that my legend still lives on with the new generations, as you can see for yourself from the graffiti:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bora grafiti dvoriste.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Bora%20grafiti%20dvoriste.jpg" width="427" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third party was a more elaborate affair. While the people found each other on Facebook and started planning there, most of the preparation happened over e-mail over several months. Several people came from abroad. We reserved an entire restaurant for our party, hired a DJ to play the 1980's Yugoslav music (which was so amazingly experimental and creative that nobody at the time noticed the syrupy, commercialized Western music by the likes of Michael Jackson) and managed to collect 55 of us, plus three of the teachers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="reunion at Lava Bar.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/reunion%20at%20Lava%20Bar.jpg" width="448" height="264"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central point for most of us was 8th grade - the time when the two shifts first met during a field trip (let me explain: half the kids went to school 8am-1:15pm and the other half 2pm-7:15pm, then reverse each week. I was B-shift, with English being 1st and French 2nd foreign language. A-shift had French as 1st - even had some other classes taught in French - and English as 2nd. Most of the people at this party were from the A shift, but we partied and made friends and even dated between shifts in 8th grade so much, it did not matter any more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also knew some of them from before and after. It is also a collection of kids from old Belgrade families. Many of our parents knew each other before we were even born. We all got haircuts from a mother of one of our friends. Another friend's mother was all of ours pediatrician. If we needed an otorhynolaryngologist, we went to one of our friend's father. The ties are multigenerational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it was fun to meet all of them, including the teachers (and yes, 8th grade crushes), I was most glad to see my best friend from those old days. We spent a lot of time together over the years, visiting each other (our fathers were also friends), going ice skating and horseback riding together, studying math for competitions, partying and just generally growing up together for about eight years of elementary/middle school (1-8th grade). But we have not heard from each other in about 25 years or so. So we spent a lot of time last Saturday night catching up with each other. After getting a degree in architecture, he built and ran a chain of diving schools on the Adriatic coast. As the wars made it impossible to run schools in Croatia while living in Serbia, he shut them down and opened a cafe in the center of Belgrade. He seems to be very happy! After the restaurant kicked all 55 of us out at 2am, we got in several cars and went to his cafe to continue partying and drinking. I got home at 4am, just a few hours before my flight home. But it was worth it. I am still excited and have this warmth in my heart from meeting all those old friends. And it would not have happened if it wasn't for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/how_facebook_got_us_together.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/KSeLRjT1SEQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247767617970"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13884">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9a961f015a9d4d15</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="College Atheists"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Camp Quest Featured in The Economist</title><published>2009-07-16T17:55:46Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T17:55:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/16/camp-quest-featured-in-the-economist/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14031492"&gt;almost-accurate and very positive&lt;/a&gt; article about &lt;a href="http://www.camp-quest.org/"&gt;Camp Quest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; today.  It’s certainly better than the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/30/camp-quest-uk-issues-corrections-to-inaccurate-articles/"&gt;piece of crap&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Sunday Times (UK)&lt;/em&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Campers are not told that there is no God; only that they should weigh the evidence. They learn about the scientific method… The kids are encouraged to explore ethical questions, too. The more argumentative ones sit in a clearing and debate the nature of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of people who send their kids to Bible camp are appalled. Answers in Genesis, a Christian fundamentalist group, berates Camp Quest for drumming a “hopeless” world view into young minds. But &lt;strong&gt;a humanist camp is less about indoctrination than reassurance that it is all right not to be religious; that it is possible to be moral without believing in the supernatural&lt;/strong&gt;. Nearly all the kids at Camp Quest say they find it comforting to be surrounded by others who share their lack of belief. Many attend schools where Christianity is taken for granted. Many keep quiet about their atheism. Those who don’t are sometimes taunted or told they will burn in hell.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last line is very scary and very true.  And it’s why we need places like Camp Quest as a reprieve for children of atheist parents over the summer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me most about the piece was a revelation made about my friend &lt;strong&gt;Don Sutterfield&lt;/strong&gt;, a fellow board member of the &lt;a href="http://secularstudents.org"&gt;Secular Student Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and a counselor at a Camp Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As part of a travelling Christian drama group, Don Sutterfield used to perform short plays. &lt;strong&gt;In one, a young man gives his girlfriend a rose and tries to persuade her to have premarital sex. The couple walk off, leaving the rose behind. Jesus picks it up and starts plucking the petals. “They love me, they love me not…”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pious audiences loved it, says Mr Sutterfield. He and his chums would stand at the altar of a Pentecostal church, speaking in tongues, laying on hands and praying for members of the congregation to be delivered from sin, sickness and sexual perversion. Occasionally, they would attempt to drive out evil spirits. It was incredibly dramatic, says Mr Sutterfield: like the movie “The Exorcist”, only with lots of exorcists. At the time, Mr Sutterfield was “immeasurably proud” of his work. But with hindsight, he thinks it was a load of mumbo-jumbo. He is now a militant atheist…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilarious.  I’m going to make him act that play out at the SSA conference next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also funny because Don is about as far from a “militant” atheist as one could get.  He’s a very calm, laid back kind of guy.  They couldn’t find a more accurate word?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it was another topic embedded in the article that actually grabbed my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They [officials and advocates for the poor] also tried to dispel the stereotype that welfare recipients are not trying to find full-time work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent opinion piece he wrote for the Los Angeles Times, Schwarzenegger said only 22 percent of the 525,000 families receiving temporary financial and employment assistance are meeting the minimum work requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That means 78 percent aren't trying to get on their feet at all," the governor wrote. "They're not working, not looking for work, not seeking job training, not performing community service and not pursuing an education."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates said the governor's measurement was flawed because it does not count part-time work and ignores the reality that low-wage earners don't have control over their hours. They said the governor was only perpetuating the stereotype that recipients are lazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an additional flaw in the assumption that those who actually are not looking for work are by default not doing so because they are lazy.  There are a number of other reasons why people may not be looking for work, just for quick and incomplete example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Financial, health, or safety disincentives like losing medicaid benefits that are necessary for survival; i.e. issues with the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Being unable to both manage basic life activities and work at the same time; i.e. not an issue, just a fact for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Being so discouraged by the process of job seeking that one gives up; i.e. issues with discrimination and lack of access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereotypes are not just bad because they are personally damaging to people.  Stereotypes are bad because perpetuating them ensures that real change to fix problems is never achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247763777372"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/16/nasa-releases-partially-restored-apollo-11-footage/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c40a0445be316048</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">NASA releases partially restored Apollo 11 footage</title><published>2009-07-16T16:24:47Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T16:24:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/16/nasa-releases-partially-restored-apollo-11-footage/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/apollo11.html"&gt;NASA released a sneak preview&lt;/a&gt; of restored video from Apollo 11!

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/mZ_mTgkGSZk%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear here: &lt;strong&gt;this video is not from any &amp;quot;lost&amp;quot; tapes!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/28/lost-apollo-11-video-tapes-found/"&gt;There were rumors&lt;/a&gt; that NASA had found tapes that were lost years ago, and these showed the Apollo 11 footage in unprecedented detail. These rumors are false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is that the telemetery from Apollo was downlinked from the Moon to two radio telescopes in Australia and one in the U.S. The data were recorded on tapes and then processed. The tapes themselves were stored for some time, but after the data were secured it was deemed that the original tapes were no longer needed. They were wiped and reused for LANDSAT and Shuttle telemetry — we’re talking hundreds of thousands of tapes here, so reusing them saved NASA a lot of money. That decision may seem silly now, but at the time was deemed necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no lost tapes were found, and no previously unseen footage has been found. What we’re seeing here is broadcast footage that has been digitally restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is value to this. For example, in the last few seconds of the montage you can see (I think) Aldrin moving across the lunar surface as he and Armstrong plant the flag. As he skips by, you can see the lunar regolith (the finely ground dust on the surface) scudding up from his boot. On Earth, that dust would billow up in the air, and travel perhaps a few centimeters. In the footage you can clearly see the dust moves on a ballistic path, barely arcing at all and moving a meter or two. Clearly this was filmed in an airless, low-gravity environment. Incredible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be a few more months before all the video is cleaned up and released. I can’t wait to sit and watch the whole thing! Today marks the 40th anniversary of the launch of the Saturn V rocket that carried the first humans to the Moon, and this is a very fitting way of celebrating that pivotal moment in history.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247762314189"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3200">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b196a097dbcf6a64</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Contest closes tomorrow</title><published>2009-07-16T16:26:01Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T16:26:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/contest-closes-tomorrow/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of noon tomorrow, I’ll close down the contest for a rare, autographed first printing of &lt;em&gt;WEIT&lt;/em&gt;, and our expert panel of judges (me) will declare a winner.   The rules and the entry thread are &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/contest/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one, from &lt;em&gt;The Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, is about &lt;a href="http://dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2009/07/15/clippers_laporta.ART_ART_07-15-09_C4_U0EFQLJ.html?sid=101"&gt;baseball player &lt;strong&gt;Matt LaPorta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaPorta was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007, traded to the Cleveland Indians in 2008 (with three other players, in exchange for one &lt;strong&gt;CC Sabathia&lt;/strong&gt;), played in his first Major League game in May of 2009, and is current with the Columbus Clippers (the triple-A affiliate of the Indians).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He struck out in his first Major League at-bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He actually seems to be a pretty good player, as the article shows.  The religious rituals go too overboard for my taste, but everyone has their quirks… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When Matt LaPorta walks to the batter’s box, the song that begins blaring over Huntington Park’s loudspeakers is not the usual hip-hop or rock music that usually pops on when a hitter steps in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called &lt;em&gt;Everlasting God&lt;/em&gt;, a rock-pop number by Lincoln Brewster, and it serves as motivation for the Clippers’ left fielder and first baseman. It also helps illustrate his relationship with God, which he calls his real drive for the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaPorta is not shy about displaying his faith. He wears a cross around his neck, points to the sky after he hits a home run and &lt;strong&gt;etches a cross in the dirt before each plate appearance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Guys ask, ‘Why don’t you (thank God) when you strike out?’ ” LaPorta said. “Well, how would the teammates feel about that?&lt;/strong&gt; In essence, I thank God after every at-bat — whether I strike out or I hit a home run.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that he answered that to anyone’s satisfaction… but at least some players are asking him what I would want to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the reporter (&lt;strong&gt;Zach Swartz&lt;/strong&gt;) just states the player’s beliefs without ever calling them into question.  That’s not just journalistic objectivity… that’s an incomplete profile.  I would think a better article would include explanations for why the player thinks the way he does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t anyone else (atheist and otherwise) think it’d be a more interesting piece if LaPorta was asked &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; God has kept him in the Minor Leagues for most of his career so far?  &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; etching a cross in the dirt makes any difference?  &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Gator4God/status/1676537084"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; two &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Gator4God/status/1934288106"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; taken together make any sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.unplanned.us"&gt;miller.2676&lt;/a&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alex does in fact like penguins because he saw them at the zoo. I’m sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stood at the glass of the penguin pool of the Central Park Zoo for perhaps 20 solid minutes. The birds obliged, shaking their heads, shooting their cuffs, and plopping into the water to glide past just inches from Alex’s nose. One or two penguins seemed to wave. One or two looked Alex in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every now and then all children at all zoos are captured by the charm of animals — I thought for Alex it would be the tiger at the Bronx Zoo who sneered at the flies around her head, or perhaps the gorilla in the Congo exhibit who sat with his broad back about a foot from the glass and picked at a hangnail — but for Alex it was the birds in the tuxes. That was plain, even though he said not a word as he watched the penguins wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So repeating “Penguin?” for almost 48 straight hours, like Bart and Lisa asking over and over “WillyoutakeustoMountSplashmore? WillyoutakeustoMountSplashmore? WillyoutakeustoMountSplashmore?” until Homer caves, made perfect sense in the universe of small kids, a completely typically developing device to get something you really want. Alex can’t plead or whine, at least in complete sentences, but he can get his point across if anyone listens the right way. And I did, ducking into the toystore half an hour before it closed on Sunday to find the right penguin. (found a whole row of them, five bucks each). Next morning Alex was up at 3, standing in the living room and calling, “Penguin? Penguin?” He whines the best he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His connection, then, makes sense, and is even one any kid would make. When you live with autism, that’s worth a lot more than five bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

To be honest, I'm not sure when this lemur went extinct, but I think it was not long before Franz found the fossil.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bones found in 1899 as well as other material have been sitting in an Austrian museum since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, without fail, the scientific judgment comes down in favor of a strictly non-miraculous, non-supernatural view of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That's what's really meant by my claim that science and religion are incompatible. I was referring to the Congregation-for-the-Causes-of-the-Saints interpretation of religion, which entails a variety of claims about things that actually happen in the world; not the it's-all-in-our-hearts interpretation, where religion makes no such claims. (I have no interest in arguing at this point in time over which interpretation is "right.") When religion, or anything else, makes claims about things that happen in the world, those claims can in principle be judged by the methods of science. That's all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, of course, there is one more thing: the judgment has been made, and views that step outside the boundaries of strictly natural explanation come up short. By "natural" I simply mean the view in which everything that happens can be explained in terms of a physical world obeying unambiguous rules, never disturbed by whimsical supernatural interventions from outside nature itself. The preference for a natural explanation is not an a priori assumption made by science; it's a conclusion of the scientific method. We know enough about the workings of the world to compare two competing big-picture theoretical frameworks: a purely naturalistic one, versus one that incorporates some sort of supernatural component. To explain what we actually see, there's no question that the naturalistic approach is simply a more compelling fit to the observations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why religion is a &lt;i&gt;failed&lt;/i&gt; explanation for the world. It just doesn't line up with the evidence, at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your second reading for the day is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2009/jul/16/daniel-dennett-belief-atheism"&gt;Dan Dennett explaining why we don't even need religion as a social construct&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am confident that those who believe in belief are wrong. That is, we no more need to preserve the myth of God in order to preserve a just and stable society than we needed to cling to the Gold Standard to keep our currency sound. It was a useful crutch, but we've outgrown it. Denmark, according to a recent study, is the sanest, healthiest, happiest, most crime-free nation in the world, and by and large the Danes simply ignore the God issue. We should certainly hope that those who believe in belief are wrong, because belief is waning fast, and the props are beginning to buckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If religion has no useful explanatory power, and if we don't need it to make our lives better and richer, why not just toss the whole ball of fluff out?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/required_reading_for_the_day.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/VRNP3d1kyUI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247756092653"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8230">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2c8fcd2dccee4102</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media Skepticism"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="ben stein"/><category term="credit report"/><category term="free credit report"/><category term="freereport.com"/><title type="html">Ben Stein Shilling for Misleading Credit Report Company</title><published>2009-07-16T14:32:02Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T14:32:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8230" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you been lying awake at night wondering if Ben Stein ever got around to developing a sense of morality or love of truth and rationality? Allow me to put you at ease: he didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="So sad" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/steincredit.jpg" alt="So sad" width="309" height="253"&gt;The image you are now attempting to avoid looking at directly appeared in my RSS reader this morning. At first glance I thought the spokesperson was a Mr. Potatohead that someone put in the microwave, but after a second glance I realized that yes, that’s Ben Stein. You may know Ben from his famous movie &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com"&gt;Expelled&lt;/a&gt;, in which he plays a creationist who was tragically born without the ability to notice that everyone is laughing &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; him, not with him. His Borat-like promotion for the film included in-character appearances on talk shows in which he claimed that science killed 6 million Jews and therefore should be destroyed, or at least exiled to an island off the coast of France or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, apparently desperate for money, Stein is shilling for FreeScore.com, one of the myriad sites that attempt to mislead consumers who have heard they’re allowed one free credit report a year. The correct, federally-mandated site for that is &lt;a href="http://annualcreditreport.com"&gt;annualcreditreport.com&lt;/a&gt;. Sites like freescore.com go out of their way to be as not free as possible. In this case, freescore.com offers you a 7-day trial, and even that isn’t free—it costs $1, and if you want to end the trial and get your buck refunded, you have to call their toll-free number and beg for it. Beg for it like the dog you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fail to respond in time to stop the trial, you will be automatically charged $30 a month by freescore.com, a URL that becomes more ironic by the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare all that to the real site, &lt;a href="http://annualcreditreport.com"&gt;annualcreditreport.com&lt;/a&gt;, which will give you an electronic copy of your credit report without asking for any credit card number or payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So congrats, Ben Stein! You’ve hitched your wagon to yet another shady operation profitting from people who don’t know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just for the record, that guy singing in the commercials is &lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/5270331/card-act-includes-limits-on-not+so+free-credit-report-ads"&gt;also shilling for a misleading company&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe he and Ben can start a variety show and take it on the road?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247755094524"><id gr:original-id="http://uncdiss.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/cancer-basics-part-3-telomerase-immortality-and-wnt-signaling/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28bb8cbd848622c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Cancer Basics Part 3: Telomerase, Immortality and Wnt Signaling</title><published>2009-07-16T08:38:19Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T08:38:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/kYhr7kFq8Kc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://uncdiss.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/cancer-basics-part-3-telomerase-immortality-and-wnt-signaling/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">One aspect we’ve discussed before about cancer development is the requirement that the cells (more specifically cancer stem cells) become immortal, able to replicate into daughter cells indefinitely.  This is seen most prominently in HeLa cells, cervical cancer cells taken from Henrietta Lacks, who died in 1951.  These cells have an overactive telomerase enzyme and [...]&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=uncdiss.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=7182341&amp;amp;post=233&amp;amp;subd=uncdiss&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

They wrote this letter and asked a bunch of us bloggers to spread it around the Web:&lt;br&gt;
_______&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are both lifelong boaters.  What we have learned from sailing across the Pacific over the past 6 years, and especially from scientists focused on marine conservation, is startling.  Whether you spend time on the water or not, Ocean Acidification affects all of us and is something we believe you will want to know about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you knew that many species of fish and other marine life in the ocean will be gone within 30 years if levels of C02 continue increasing at their present rate? We believe you would take action to stop this from happening, because informed people make informed choices. This letter is about what we can and must do together now to help solve a very serious but little-known problem, Ocean Acidification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ocean Acidification is primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels.  When carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ends up in the ocean it changes the pH, making the sea acidic and less hospitable to life. Over time, C02 reduces calcium carbonate, which prevents creatures from forming shells and building reefs. In fact, existing shells will start to dissolve. Oysters and mussels will not be able to build shells.  Crabs and lobsters?  Your great-grandchildren may wonder what they tasted like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide concentrated in the oceans is making seawater acidic.  Many of the zooplankton, small animals at the base of the food web, have skeletons that won't form in these conditions, and sea-life further up the food chain - fish, mammals and seabirds that rely on zooplankton for food will also perish. No food - no life.  One billion people rely on seafood for their primary source of protein.  Many scientific reports document that worldwide, humans are already consuming more food than is being produced.  The implications are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of Ocean Acidification is causing irreversible loss to species and habitats, and acidification trends are happening up to ten times faster than projected.  We want you to know what this means, how it affects all of us, and what we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the atmospheric concentration of C02 is about 387 parts per million (ppm) and increasing at 2 ppm per year.  If left unaddressed, by 2040 it is projected to be over 450 ppm, and marine scientists believe the collapse of many ocean ecosystems will be irreversible. Acidification has other physiological effects on marine life as well, including changes in reproduction, growth rates, and even respiration in fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tropical and coldwater corals are among the oldest and largest living structures on earth; the richest in terms of biodiversity, they provide spawning areas, nursery habitat and feeding grounds for a quarter of all species in the sea. Coral reefs are at risk!  As C02 concentrations increase, corals, shellfish and other species that make shells will not be able to build their skeletons and will likely become extinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is we can fix this problem. But, as you guessed, it will be difficult.  Ocean Acidification is caused by increased C02 in the atmosphere.  Solving one will solve the other.  The House of Representatives has acted, passing HR 2454, the Waxman-Markey "American Clean Energy and Security Act", but it was severely weakened.  Now the Senate has announced that it will move similar legislation this fall.  We need the Senate to join the House in its leadership, but to demand far greater emissions reductions than were able to pass the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that in order to stabilize C02 in the atmosphere at 350 ppm by 2050, global carbon emissions need to be cut 85% below 2000 levels."That's a very tall order! And the way our political system works (or doesn't) makes its tougher.  It will take all of us to step up and take responsibility to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what you can do: Contact your Senator now using ont of these techniques listed in order of effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Visit your Senator at their local office. It is easy to make an appointment. Tell them your concerns about C02 and the oceans, and to move strong climate legislation immediately that will reduce our greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that will not threaten our oceans. The experience is rewarding. (Alternatively, drop a letter off at their local office.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Call your Senator and leave a message urging action be taken to reduce C02 , address Ocean Acidification, and move strong climate legislation immediately that will reduce our greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that will not threaten our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Click on this link to send an email, which will go directly to your Senator based on your address: &lt;a href="http://www.oceana.org/acid" title=""&gt;http://www.oceana.org/acid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may use the letter provided, but it is more effective to edit it, and in your own words urge them to move strong climate legislation immediately that will reduce our greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that will not threaten our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocean Acidification is an issue we can do something about.  We need a groundswell of informed citizens to get Congress to have the backbone to stand up to the entrenched interests of coal, oil, and gas and not compromise on the reduction of C02.  We also need real leadership to aggressively create jobs using sustainable technologies. The choice is ours.  We can solve this or not.  What we do know is that the future facing our children, grandchildren and indeed all of humankind depends on our decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us in sharing this letter with others.  We appreciate your taking the time to contact your Senators; it is easy to do and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support.                      &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people would prefer to define “religion” so that religious beliefs entail nothing whatsoever about what happens in the world. And that’s fine; definitions are not correct or incorrect, they are simply useful or useless, where usefulness is judged by the clarity of one’s attempts at communication. Personally, I think using “religion” in that way is not very clear. Most Christians would disagree with the claim that Jesus came about because Joseph and Mary had sex and his sperm fertilized her ovum and things proceeded conventionally from there, or that Jesus didn’t really rise from the dead, or that God did not create the universe. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints"&gt;Congregation for the Causes of Saints&lt;/a&gt;, whose job it is to judge whether a candidate for canonization has really performed the required number of miracles and so forth, would probably not agree that miracles don’t occur. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins_%28geneticist%29"&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;, recently nominated to direct the NIH, argues that some sort of God hypothesis helps explain the values of the fundamental constants of nature, just like a good Grand Unified Theory would. These views are by no means outliers, even without delving into the more extreme varieties of Biblical literalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carroll then clarifies what he sees as the main endeavor of scientists; the construction of theories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2005/09/19/theories-laws-facts/"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; is also occasionally troublesome, but the humble language shouldn’t obscure the potential reach of the idea: whether we call them theories, models, hypotheses, or what have you, science passes judgment on &lt;em&gt;ideas about how the world works&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s the crucial point. Science doesn’t do a bunch of experiments concerning colliding objects, and say “momentum was conserved in that collision, and in that one, and in that one,” and stop there. It does those experiments, and then it also proposes frameworks for understanding how the world works, and then it compares those theoretical frameworks to that experimental data, and — if the data and theories seem good enough — passes judgment. The judgments are necessarily tentative — one should always be open to the possibility of better theories or surprising new data — but are no less useful for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says this about multiverse (multiple-universe) “theories”, which theistic evolutionists like Kenneth Miller dismiss as “Hail Marys,” desperation passes thrown out by scientists to explain why physical constants appear to be “fine tuned” for the existence of life. Here is what Miller says about multiverses in his book &lt;em&gt;Only a Theory&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believers . . . are right to remind skeptics and agnostics that one of their favored explanations for the nature of our existence involves an element of the imagination as wild as any tale in a sacred book: namely, the existence of countless parallel simultaneous universes with which we can never communicate and whose existence we cannot even test. Such belief also requires an extraordinary level of “faith” and the nonreligious would do well to admit as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, multiverses are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; something concocted by scientists to save their cookies; they grow naturally out of some theories of physics.  As Carroll argues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same logic applies, for example, to the highly contentious case of the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/03/15/science-and-unobservable-things/"&gt;multiverse&lt;/a&gt;.  The multiverse isn’t, by itself, a theory; it’s a &lt;em&gt;prediction&lt;/em&gt; of a certain class of theories. If the idea were simply “Hey, we don’t know what happens outside our observable universe, so maybe all sorts of crazy things happen,” it would be laughably uninteresting. By scientific standards, it would fall woefully short. But the point is that various theoretical attempts to explain phenomena that we directly observe right in front of us — like gravity, and quantum field theory — lead us to predict that our universe should be one of many, and subsequently suggest that we take that situation seriously when we talk about the “naturalness” of various features of our local environment. The point, at the moment, is not whether there really is or is not a multiverse; it’s that the way we think about it and reach conclusions about its plausibility is through exactly the same kind of scientific reasoning we’ve been using for a long time now. Science doesn’t pass judgment on phenomena; it passes judgment on theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carroll then explains why certain religious claims are indeed empirical claims about the real world, and in that sense are scientific:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s turn to a closely analogous question. There is some historical evidence that, about two thousand years ago in Galilee, a person named Jesus was born to a woman named Mary, and later grew up to be a messianic leader and was eventually crucified by the Romans. (Unruly bloke, by the way — tended to be pretty doctrinaire about the number of &lt;a href="http://www.wcg.org/lit/gospel/oneway.htm"&gt;paths to salvation&lt;/a&gt;, and prone to throwing moneychangers out of temples. Not very “accommodating,” if you will.) The question is: how did Mary get pregnant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach would be to say:  we just don’t know.  We weren’t there, don’t have any reliable data, etc.  Should just be quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific approach is very different.  We have two theories.  One theory is that Mary was a &lt;a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm"&gt;virgin&lt;/a&gt;; she had never had sex before becoming pregnant, or encountered sperm in any way. Her pregnancy was a miraculous event, carried out through the intervention of the Holy Ghost, a spiritual manifestation of a triune God. The other theory is that Mary got pregnant through relatively conventional channels, with the help of (one presumes) her husband. According to this theory, claims to the contrary in early (although not contemporary) literature are, simply, erroneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no question that these two theories can be judged scientifically. One is conceptually very simple; all it requires is that some ancient texts be mistaken, which we know happens all the time, even with texts that are considerably less ancient and considerably better corroborated. The other is conceptually horrible; it posits an isolated and unpredictable deviation from otherwise universal rules, and invokes a set of vaguely-defined spiritual categories along the way. By all of the standards that scientists have used for hundreds of years, the answer is clear: the sex-and-lies theory is enormously more compelling than the virgin-birth theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, he goes into the methodological naturalism/philosophical naturalism distinction that some people, including Mooney and Kirshenbaum in their book &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;, use as a stick to beat those mean atheists. &lt;a href="http://metamagician3000.blogspot.com/search?q=methodological+naturalism"&gt;As Russell Blackford has shown&lt;/a&gt;, this distinction is really a red herring in the discussion about whether science and faith are compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could science, through its strategy of judging hypotheses on the basis of comparison with empirical data, ever move beyond naturalism to conclude that some sort of supernatural influence was a necessary feature of explaining what happens in the world? Sure; why not? If supernatural phenomena really did exist, and really did influence things that happened in the world, science would do its best to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice piece, and I doubt that anyone could construe it as “militant” or “shrill”. Go read the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the body of thought that leads to judicial stonings and mutilations to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legislative assemblies of Ireland and Lithuania, each just a short boat ride from Swedish shores, have recently shown that the mindset they cultivate is certainly not that of AD 700. They are aiming for Old Testament times, 700 BC or earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ireland, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2009/jul/09/ireland-blasphemy-laws"&gt;blasphemous speech is now illegal&lt;/a&gt;. "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain." (Exodus 20:7)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Lithuania, is is now &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-07-14-lithuania-censorship_N.htm"&gt;illegal for media and schools&lt;/a&gt; to spread information that "agitates for homosexual, bisexual relations, or polygamy." "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them." (Leviticus 20:13)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To all free-thinking and tolerant people in Ireland and Lithuania, this must of course be a huge embarrassment. You have my sympathy! I hope these laws will not mark the beginning of a slide backward to the Bronze Age for your countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/ireland_and_lithuania_pass_old.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/maeBs9-K5-M" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247753135216"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=15119">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0765e1c2fbae21e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="space"/><category term="weather"/><title type="html">Can't NASA Find a Better Launch Site?</title><published>2009-07-16T13:41:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T13:41:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/cant-nasa-find-a-better-launch-site/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">After bad weather foiled several launch attempts, the Space Shuttle Endeavor finally &lt;a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/orl-bk-space-shuttle-launch-endeavour-071509,0,4027736.story"&gt;took off last night&lt;/a&gt; from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida's Cape Canaveral.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A corollary to the argument that Afghanistan is unconquerable is the argument that it is ungovernable—that the country has never been a functioning nation-state, and that its people, mired in a culture of violence not amenable to Western fixes, have no interest in helping to build a more open and peaceful society. Certainly endemic low-level warfare is embedded in Pashtun society—&lt;strong&gt;the words for cousin and enemy in Pashtu, for instance, are the same&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;[emphasis added]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Soleimani, who sent this link to me, asked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Naturally, I was somewhat suspicious of the validity of this; and a little looking in online Pashto-English dictionaries indeed failed to turn up any evidence for it. &lt;a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/raverty/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; seems to be fairly comprehensive dictionary, and it contains &lt;a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=raverty&amp;amp;query=enemy&amp;amp;matchtype=exact&amp;amp;display=utf8"&gt;8 words whose definitions include "enemy"&lt;/a&gt;, none of which give "cousin" or anything similar as a meaning. The most common word for 'enemy' (judged by its presence in other dictionaries) seems to be &lt;a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:4315.raverty"&gt;duś̱ẖman&lt;/a&gt; (دښمن), glossed as "adversary, enemy, foe." This dictionary does appear to be from the 19th-century, so perhaps the usage has changed since then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Do you know if the statement is true? And if it isn't, do you have any idea where the author may have gotten the idea?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A version of this claim has been around for a while. The earliest version that I could find is in Sir Denzil Ibbetson, &lt;em&gt;Census Report For the Punjab&lt;/em&gt;, 1883, as quoted in H.A. Rose, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UQUtQzPtC6wC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North West Frontier Province&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 1911 (click on the image for a larger version):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Ibbetson.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Ibbetson.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the same dictionary that Ali used (Henry George Raverty, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tJ8CAAAAQAAJ"&gt;A dictionary of the Puk'hto, Pus'hto, or language of the Afghāns&lt;/a&gt;, 1867) gives only the meaning "A father's brother's son, a cousin", for what must be the same word, &lt;a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:2318.raverty"&gt;turbūr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Pashto word for &amp;quot;enemy&amp;quot; that Ali cites is apparently still in use — thus Niloufer Qasim Mahdi, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.bepress.com/context/gruterclassics/article/1036/viewcontent/"&gt;Pukhtunwali: Ostacism and Honor Among the Pathan Hill Tribes&lt;/a&gt;", Ethology and Sociobiology 7: 295-304 (1986): "If a man seeking badal [revenge] is weak vis-a-vis his "dushman" (enemy), he will pass on his obligation to his sons, and they in turn to their sons." But I can't find any evidence that &lt;em&gt;dushman&lt;/em&gt; is ever also used as a kinship term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers who know Pashto are invited to comment. Meanwhile, a clue to the source of Ibbetson's (apparently false) claim can be found in Louis Dupree, "Tribal Warfare in Afghanistan and Pakistan", in Akbar Ahmed and David Hart, Eds., &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ra89AAAAIAAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Islam in Tribal Societies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 1984:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Language sometimes reveals unarticulated (or downplayed) conflicts in a society. The term for cousin in Pashto is &lt;em&gt;turbur&lt;/em&gt; [and] the word for the worst kind of hatred is &lt;em&gt;turburghanay&lt;/em&gt; which could be literally translated 'cousin-hatred'. But the non-literate, rural Pushtun deny this interpretation. They say: 'Turbur is turbur and turburghanay is turburghanay. They are separate words. How can they relate? How could I hate my cousin? I would fight to the death with him. I would never leave his body behind in a fight. I would give him my last crust of bread.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The overwhelming majority of Afghans and Pakistanis cannot read and write, so showing them that the written &lt;em&gt;turbur&lt;/em&gt; is a prefix and &lt;em&gt;-ghanay&lt;/em&gt; a suffix, which , when combined create a compound word, fails to impress. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tentatively conclude that the cousin/enemy meme is another of those linguistic confusions or exaggerations, like &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1087"&gt;Eskimo snow vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1212"&gt;Chinese crisis/opportunity&lt;/a&gt;, that are easy to start and hard to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the cousin/enemy meme has spread widely, and is often reproduced by people who learned about it in Pakistan or Afghanistan, though the people who spread it usually don't tell us what the allegedly singular cousin/enemy word is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Isabel Hilton, &lt;a href="http://sherryx.wordpress.com/2009/03/01/letter-from-pakistan-pashtun-code/"&gt;"Letter from Pakistan: Pashtun Code"&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, 2001: Adam Nayyar, a fifty-two-year-old former nuclear chemical engineer, who abandoned his career when Pakistan began trying to build the bomb, in the mid-seventies, is now an ethnomusicologist and an expert on Pashtun culture. I spoke with him at his apartment in Islamabad. “Pashto is the only language I know in which the word for ‘cousin’ is the same as the word for ‘enemy,’ “ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Marcela Gaviria, "&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/search/behind/30.html"&gt;In search of Al Qaeda&lt;/a&gt;", Frontline (2002): And then there is what I read. For instance, today I learn that in Pashto "cousin" is the same word as "enemy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.safdar.net/shabbir/2005/01/pakistan_diarie_5.html"&gt;Pakistan Diaries: Darra bazaar&lt;/a&gt;": Sarah takes the time to read up on the Afridis and their language, Pashto, and explains that the Star Trek phrase, "Revenge is a dish best served cold" is actually an old Pashto saying. Apparently tribal people have gone as far as Los Angeles to avenge an inter-family quarrel with an honor-killing. Being related to another Afridi appears to offer no protection either, as cousins routinely quarrel over women and money with frightening regularity. Sarah continues to cheerily point out that in Pashto, the words for "cousin" and "enemy" are exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cousin/enemy trope is useful because it highlights a stereotypical characteristic of &lt;a href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/anthropology/tutor/descent/unilineal/segments.html"&gt;segmentary lineage systems&lt;/a&gt;, which I have often heard illustrated by a proverb that goes something like &amp;quot;I against my brother; my brother and I against our cousin; my cousin and I against a stranger&amp;quot;. From a Somali language consultant, I heard a version of this that broke things down into five or six concentric layers of potential inter-segment warfare; and I&amp;#39;ve heard similar sayings attributed to the Bedouin, to highland Scots — and to the Pashtun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bernt Glatzer, "&lt;a href="http://www.ag-afghanistan.de/files/tribal_system.pdf"&gt;The Pashtun Tribal System&lt;/a&gt;" (2002):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Pashtuns are said to having developed the world's largest tribal society, and in local thinking the tribal system even encompasses all humanity, as Barakhan, one of my informants, an Atsakzay nomad of Badghis, Northwest Afghanistan, has put it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:50px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"When God created the animals and humans he first created one ant and his spouse, then one buck and his goat, one ram and his sheep … finally one man and his wife, and from these ancestors sprang the tribes (&lt;em&gt;qawm&lt;/em&gt;) of the ants, of the goats, of the sheep and finally the tribe of Adam. The offspring of the first ant became the grandfathers (&lt;em&gt;nikagan&lt;/em&gt;) of the various tribes (&lt;em&gt;qawm&lt;/em&gt;) and subtribes (&lt;em&gt;qawm&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;khel&lt;/em&gt;) of ants …, as Adam's sons became the &lt;em&gt;nikagan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;qawm&lt;/em&gt;), and their sons the &lt;em&gt;nikagan&lt;/em&gt; of the tribes (&lt;em&gt;qawm&lt;/em&gt;) within these peoples. One of Adam's sons or grandsons was Ibrahim, the &lt;em&gt;nika&lt;/em&gt; of all nomads."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;An equation of animal and human society is what one might expect from a pastoral nomad, but the main structural elements in this statement are shared by pastoral, agricultural and other Pashtuns: the notion that the divine tribal order unifies and divides all human beings or even all creatures. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There is a dilemma in tribal societies: the very tool which enables tribal leaders to establish powerful political entities, the charter of segmentary solidarity, is also instrumental for segmentary division. Once a charismatic leader who masters the instrument of segmentary alliance looses influence or dies the divisive character of the segmentary tribal system will gain the upper hand. Tribal systems do not usually develop institutionalised political power which could tolerate fluctuations in the abilities of individual rulers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The Pashtun ideal of equality is based on the tribal system. The idea is that all Pashtuns are born equal, and are children of one common ancestor; social and economic inequality, which of course exists, is not given by nature or birth but is achieved individually, and is threatened and open to change at any time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Whereas the tribal order discourages social hierarchy, it defines social nearness and distance. Pashtuns use their tribal order to mark lines of conflict and solidarity. If I see two men fighting I am supposed to side with the one who is “closer” to me, i.e. the one with whom I share the nearest common patrilineal ancestor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0907.bergen.html"&gt;Peter Bergen article&lt;/a&gt; that started this off, we find that he follows the cousin/enemy meme with a contrary argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But the level of violence in Afghanistan is actually far lower than most Americans believe. In 2008 more than 2,000 Afghan civilians died at the hands of the Taliban or coalition forces; this is too many, but it is also less than a quarter of the deaths last year in Iraq, a country that is both more sparsely populated and often assumed to be easier to govern. (At the height of the violence in Iraq, 3,200 civilians were dying every month, making the country around twenty times more violent than Afghanistan is today.) Not only are Afghan civilians much safer under American occupation than Iraqis, they are also statistically less likely to be killed in the war than anyone living in the United States during the early 1990s, when the U.S. murder rate peaked at more than 24,000 killings a year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that this is less contrary to the norms of Pukhtunwali than Bergen seems to think. Back to &lt;a href="http://www.bepress.com/context/gruterclassics/article/1036/viewcontent/"&gt;Mahdi&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The most commonly practiced form of punishment, and the cornerstone of Pukhtunwali, is badal. The term is particularly applied to "revenge killing." Badal is an action taken to avenge death, or when the honor of a woman has been involved. When it is a matter to be resolved by badal, the right to avenge by death is the prerogative of the individual immediately concerned, but that right also resides in the family, section, clan, or tribe. Further, badal need not be restricted to action against the culprit, but can be taken against any member of his kinship group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As a tool of social control, badal is an adaptive punishment and an effective deterrent. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Since the obligation of badal devolves upon a kinship group and the target of badal also can be any member of a kinship group, there is pressure on the individual by the group to refrain from letting a situation develop to a point at which it becomes a problem for the other members of the group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;For the above-enumerated reasons, badal acts as a powerful curb on wanton killing. Given the Pathan trait of being quick to anger, the ubiquity of weapons and the facility with which they are resorted to in a quarrel, were it not for the principle of badal, tribal life would degenerate into a Hobbesian state of anarchy and war. It is thus interesting to compare Pukhtunwali to the Social Contract theory of Hobbes and Locke, English political theorists who regarded the state as the inevitable outcome of the desire to end a pre-state condition of anarchy and insecurity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247752872400"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/how_do_can_one_know.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1b245961e6ca8a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism/critical thinking"/><title type="html">How can one know?</title><published>2009-07-16T14:00:17Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T14:00:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/QC89xhDoD34/how_do_can_one_know.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/how_do_can_one_know.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there was one thing about going to TAM7 last week, it was the opportunity to contemplate among a thousand fellow skeptics just what critical thinking and reason mean. If there's one thing about woo, pseudoscience, and conspiracy theories in all their forms, it's not just a lack of critical thinking and a plethora of logical fallacies. More importantly, it's the question, "How do we know what we know?" Certainly science is the primary means by which we explore the natural world and make conclusions about how it works, however imperfect they may be, but not everyone uses science, reason, and critical thinking. Arguments over what is and is not true can be cutthroat enough when it's scientists arguing over science- and evidence-based viewpoints, but what happens when the arguments are not science- and evidence-based?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hilarity, that's what. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/burned_out_on_the_bickering_am.php"&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt; pointed me to &lt;a href="http://www.twincities.com/newsletter-morning/ci_12823168?nclick_check=1"&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; that shows just how hilarious arguments between woo-meisters can be. What do I mean? Simple. The story is about a new editor of a New Age magazine who decided that he couldn't abide by real woo, if you know what I mean. What? You don't? Suffice it to say that he somehow thought he could impose some reason--such as it is--on the wild and wooly world of New Age as reported in his magazine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the editor, Miejan has become a New Age gatekeeper, deciding which legitimate beliefs get into the magazine and which are too far out to be included.

&lt;p&gt;It's not an easy job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chiropractors want out of the New Age movement. Channelers wonder if they belong at all, and pagans feel jilted. Organic farmers don't want to be near pet psychics. And no one knows what to do with the witches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a movement based on peace, love and understanding, New Age looks like a battleground.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally, special thanks to Randy and Sally-Christine for all of their wonderful oceans work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are both lifelong boaters.  What we have learned from sailing across the Pacific over the past 6 years, and especially from scientists focused on marine conservation, is startling.  Whether you spend time on the water or not, Ocean Acidification affects all of us and is something we believe you will want to know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you knew that many species of fish and other marine life in the ocean will be gone within 30 years if levels of C02 continue increasing at their present rate? We believe you would take action to stop this from happening, because informed people make informed choices. This letter is about what we can and must do together now to help solve a very serious but little-known problem, Ocean Acidification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean Acidification is primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels.  When carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ends up in the ocean it changes the pH, making the sea acidic and less hospitable to life. Over time, C02 reduces calcium carbonate, which prevents creatures from forming shells and building reefs. In fact, existing shells will start to dissolve. Oysters and mussels will not be able to build shells.  Crabs and lobsters?  Your great-grandchildren may wonder what they tasted like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide concentrated in the oceans is making seawater acidic.  Many of the zooplankton, small animals at the base of the food web, have skeletons that won’t form in these conditions, and sea-life further up the food chain – fish, mammals and seabirds that rely on zooplankton for food will also perish. No food – no life.  One billion people rely on seafood for their primary source of protein.  Many scientific reports document that worldwide, humans are already consuming more food than is being produced.  The implications are obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of Ocean Acidification is causing irreversible loss to species and habitats, and acidification trends are happening up to ten times faster than projected.  We want you to know what this means, how it affects all of us, and what we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the atmospheric concentration of C02 is about 387 parts per million (ppm) and increasing at 2 ppm per year.  If left unaddressed, by 2040 it is projected to be over 450 ppm, and marine scientists believe the collapse of many ocean ecosystems will be irreversible. Acidification has other physiological effects on marine life as well, including changes in reproduction, growth rates, and even respiration in fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropical and coldwater corals are among the oldest and largest living structures on earth; the richest in terms of biodiversity, they provide spawning areas, nursery habitat and feeding grounds for a quarter of all species in the sea. Coral reefs are at risk!  As C02 concentrations increase, corals, shellfish and other species that make shells will not be able to build their skeletons and will likely become extinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is we can fix this problem. But, as you guessed, it will be difficult.  Ocean Acidification is caused by increased C02 in the atmosphere.  Solving one will solve the other.  The House of Representatives has acted, passing HR 2454, the Waxman-Markey “American Clean Energy and Security Act”, but it was severely weakened.  Now the Senate has announced that it will move similar legislation this fall.  We need the Senate to join the House in its leadership, but to demand far greater emissions reductions than were able to pass the House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that in order to stabilize C02 in the atmosphere at 350 ppm by 2050, global carbon emissions need to be cut 85% below 2000 levels.”That’s a very tall order! And the way our political system works (or doesn’t) makes its tougher.  It will take all of us to step up and take responsibility to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what you can do: Contact your Senator now using ont of these techniques listed in order of effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Visit your Senator at their local office. It is easy to make an appointment. Tell them your concerns about C02 and the oceans, and to move strong climate legislation immediately that will reduce our greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that will not threaten our oceans. The experience is rewarding. (Alternatively, drop a letter off at their local office.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Call your Senator and leave a message urging action be taken to reduce C02 , address Ocean Acidification, and move strong climate legislation immediately that will reduce our greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that will not threaten our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Click on this link to send an email, which will go directly to your Senator based on your address: &lt;a href="http://www.oceana.org/acid"&gt;http://www.oceana.org/acid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may use the letter provided, but it is more effective to edit it, and in your own words urge them to move strong climate legislation immediately that will reduce our greenhouse gas concentrations to levels that will not threaten our oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean Acidification is an issue we can do something about.  We need a groundswell of informed citizens to get Congress to have the backbone to stand up to the entrenched interests of coal, oil, and gas and not compromise on the reduction of C02.  We also need real leadership to aggressively create jobs using sustainable technologies. The choice is ours.  We can solve this or not.  What we do know is that the future facing our children, grandchildren and indeed all of humankind depends on our decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join us in sharing this letter with others.  We appreciate your taking the time to contact your Senators; it is easy to do and effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your support.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Moncrieff takes a stand against drug therapy for psychiatric conditions. While there are certainly legitimate points to be made about the misuse or overuse of psychotropic drugs, I did not find Moncrieff article compelling or well reasoned. She creates a bit of a straw man regarding what she perceives to be a bias toward pharmacotherapy for depression and other mental disorders, and then attempts to replace it not with a more neutral or scientific view, but with her own biases against pharmacotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with schizophrenia and other conditions are frequently told that they need to take psychiatric medication for the rest of their lives to stabilise their brain chemicals, just like a diabetic needs to take insulin. The trouble is there is little justification for this view of psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Views about psychiatric drugs changed over the course of the 1950s and 1960s.  They gradually came to be seen as being specific treatments for specific diseases, or “magic bullets”, and their psychoactive effects were forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Moncrieff makes two main points about the current attitudes toward mental illness – that they are conceived as imbalances in brain chemicals, and as specific diseases that can be cured with a specific treatment. In my opinion, both of these contentions are exaggerated to the point of being wrong – they are straw men.The “chemical imbalance” notion is often used as a shorthand explanation that physicians give patients, but it is an acknowledged oversimplification, not a working model. There is also sufficient truth to it to make it not unreasonable – but it is only part of the picture. Mental disorders, in some cases, result from underlying brain function, which is determined by the pattern of neuronal connections in the relevant brain regions and their level of activity. The level of activity is in turn determined by many factors, including the amount of neurotransmitter release, how quickly it is inactivated, and the sensitivity of various receptors.  In the last couple of decades we have also gained a deeper appreciation for the role of astrocytes (support cells) in modifying and regulating neuronal function.Of course it is an oversimplification to summarize all of this as a “chemical imbalance” but patient encounters often do not allow for an in-depth discussion of the latest neuroscience.
&lt;p&gt;Moncrieff also implies that there is little or no evidence for the “chemical imbalance” view. I think this claim is misleading – “chemical imbalance” is an oversimplification, but it is not wrong. There is copious evidence for altered activity in various regions of the brain in many identified psychiatric syndromes – and this includes differing levels of neurotransmitter (chemical) activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also disagree with Moncrieff’s use of the term “disease”. Frankly, this is a tactic I have seen from mental-illness deniers for years. Mental illnesses are not “diseases” in that there is no cellular pathology that can be identified. But this is irrelevant since that is not the model for most mental illness in any case. Brain function is determined by the pattern of neuronal connections and their neurotransmitter activity. If you change these patterns, you change mental function. If mental function is far enough outside of adaptive and healthy parameters, what you have is a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental disorders are often not discrete entities – because the brain is so complex, and each subsystem in the brain interacts with all the other subsystems and then the environment to create a complex net result. This leads to fuzzy classification systems based upon clinical signs and symptoms. However, it is the false continuum logical fallacy to claim that therefore these mental disorders do not exist. Schizophrenia is perhaps the worst example Moncrieff could have used since it is the most clear cut mental disorder, in my opinion, with strong evidence for altered brain function, specifically in the frontal dopamine regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having slain her straw men, Moncrieff goes on to create her own equally biased and misleading view of  drug treatment for mental illness. She writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is frequently overlooked that drugs used in psychiatry are psychoactive drugs, like alcohol and cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychoactive drugs make people feel different; they put people into an altered mental and physical state. They affect everyone, regardless of whether they have a mental disorder or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim that drugs used for psychiatric conditions are not seen as psychoactive drugs seems extraordinary to me, and is certainly at odds with my own experience. I often refer to the various classes of drugs that affect brain function explicitly as psychotropic drugs. Perhaps I am perceiving the difference between the experience of a neurologist and that of a psychiatrist, but I doubt that explains everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that such drugs affect everyone is also completely irrelevant. So does insulin – so do all drugs. Oddly stating this obvious fact implies that there is the belief that psychotropic drugs only affect the mentally ill – another straw man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wants to replace the “chemical imbalance” view of mental illness and psychiatric drugs with the “altered states” view. However, this view is as biased against rational pharmacotherapy as her straw man of “chemical imbalance” is in favor – and she entirely neglects the more nuanced and reasonable view in the middle that I described above  (therefore she creates a false dichotomy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my view it remains more plausible that they “work” by producing drug-induced states which suppress or mask emotional problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the scare quotes around “work.”  She is implying that psychiatric drugs put patients into an abnormal brain state that masks their real problems. While she acknowledges that such treatments may be useful in some cases in the short term, she implies it is not a real solution. She wants better informed consent from patients, but it seems that what she really wants is to scare patients off of pharmacotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I think this reasoning goes wrong is in the failure to recognize that we are all always in a “brain state.” Our brains are always in some state or another – wakefulness, drowsiness, sleep, arousal, panic, depression, etc. Being in a brain state is not an abnormal condition. Some people are in brain states that they find unpleasant and dysfunctional (or that others find dysfunctional – sometimes people lack insight into their own brain state). If someone is in a constantly depressed state to the point that they cannot function or enjoy life it is reasonable to alter their state if we can. If this can be accomplished with therapy, great. If not and pharmacology can work, that is a reasonable approach also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moncrieff wants to stigmatize psychotropic drugs as causing an abnormal brain state. But they just cause a different brain state, no more “normal” or “abnormal” than any other, although admittedly a pharmacologically forced brain state. The rational clinical approach is to give patients treatment trials  – if they like their brain state on a certain dose of a specific medication better than their brain state unmedicated, and they tolerate the side effects, use is appropriate and should not be stigmatized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also many severe conditions like schizophrenia where some individuals do not have the ability to distinguish between reality and their paranoid fears. In this state they may become completely dysfunctional, even to the point of being catatonic in extreme cases. Tweaking their brain chemistry can make them functional, even if they do not recognize their own disorder, especially when in a psychotic state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that current pharmacological treatment for mental disorders is crude. We are hitting the entire brain with a chemical sledgehammer, when the patient may need a precise scalpel. That is just the current limitation of our technology.  We have made some incremental progress, targeting neurotransmitter subtypes, for example, but I consider our current best treatments to still be frustratingly crude. They can still be extremely useful, however, even life saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational middle in between Moncrieff’s false dichotomy, with her straw men characterization of psychiatry on one side and her anti-pharmacotherapy stigmatizing approach on the other, is to recognize the complexity of the brain and of mental disorders, to recognize that disorders are just that, and not discrete diseases, and to use pharmacotherapy judiciously and thoughtfully. The best practitioners do this, while of course there are those who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think we will make further incremental advances in pharmacotherapy, the paradigm is inherently limited. We have a limited ability to target specific brain functions, because evolution left us with a messy system. Different brain regions and functions use the same or similar neurotransmitters and receptors – therefore we cannot affect one without affecting the other, producing unwanted effects. Also, as I stated, brain chemistry is only part of the picture – the pattern of neuronal connections is another, and is most cases is probably the dominant factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are looking forward to new paradigms of treating brain disorders. We are already developing drug delivery systems that target specific brain regions. We may be able to affect brain structure and function directly with stem cells and genetic engineering. And we are rapidly developing the ability to interface computer chips and brain tissue. We will likely one day be able to actually change the pattern of neuronal connections in the brain, not just compensate for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile rational pharmacotherapy is a reasonable option that should not be stigmatized. To do so is likely to cause unnecessary suffering and dysfunction among those with mental disorders that can be helped with the right drug treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

In 1996 he created the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/about-the-foundation.html"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (JREF) designed to expose the fraudulent claims made by psychics, faith healers, and snake oil salesmen. The ultimate goal of the JREF is to create a new generation of critical thinkers – people who will not be hoodwinked by the aforementioned hucksters.I had the good fortune of interviewing Mr. Randi briefly at the recent conference known as “&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;The Amazing Meeting&lt;/a&gt;.” I was eager to pick his brain about human behavior and magical thinking. This is what I learned…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randi identified certain groups of people who seem to be more susceptible to magical thinking and/or belief in the paranormal. According to him, the top two are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;News reporters&lt;/strong&gt;. Although at first I wasn’t sure if Randi meant that reporters like a good story versus they &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; a good story – he told me that in his experience, they were some of the most gullible people on earth. In fact, they were more interested in implausible stories than true ones – and Randi said that the more fantastical his explanation for phenomena, the more likely they were to believe it and write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Academics&lt;/strong&gt;. This surprised me since I assumed that this group would actually be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; susceptible. Randi suggested that they are more likely to be taken in because they are single-minded about phenomena. They are over confident in their ability to understand how things work, and when something cannot be explained in their framework, they’re willing to attribute it to the paranormal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are the least susceptible? Children. Why? Because they are simple thinkers, and harder to distract. The art of magic is in distraction of the sophisticated mind. Children tend to be very concrete, so they don’t expect things to happen with hand-waving and flourishes. They keep their eye on the coin (or other item being transferred from hand to hand), and are more likely to know where it is at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up our short interview, I asked Randi if he could explain why people believe in magic, fantasy, and the paranormal? He responded plainly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it’s not about intelligence or lack thereof. It’s about people not wanting to accept that life is random, suffering is inevitable, and there is no good reason for bad things happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you make of Randi’s observations?&lt;/p&gt;

A group is lobbying to slap a bunch of religious phrases on the US Capitol Visitor's Center, and their rationale is inane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engravings will cost less than $100,000 of the center's total $621 million price tag. Fighting this silly lawsuit will probably cost more than the engravings themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred thousand dollars isn&amp;#39;t peanuts, and the argument that nobody should oppose them because it will cost even more money is ridiculous — if economy is a concern, then &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; vandalize the building in the first place! No engraving costs, no legal expenses, we're all happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this guy hasn't quite hit his stride yet. Let's bring on the tired old "freedom of religion, not freedom from religion" argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's start by pointing out the First Amendment doesn't grant freedom "from" religion, just freedom "of" religion. It doesn't ban religion, it provides freedom for all so that one denomination doesn't dominate or become the official state religion. Whether you practice a religion or not is up to people's preferences.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No one is forced to worship because they saw the motto on a $20 bill. Or because they recited the Pledge of Allegiance. It's pretty innocuous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All right, I say this fellow needs to put his money where his mouth is. Let&amp;#39;s add &amp;quot;Praise be unto Allah&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;No gods, no masters&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Hail, Xenu!&amp;quot; to the center and to our money — think he&amp;#39;ll argue that it is all innocuous then? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that he has convinced you of the quality of his arguments, go vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/todaysbuzz/thursday/sfl-atheist-religion-capitol-buzz-fins-m071609,0,7520979.story"&gt;Should the national motto, "In God We Trust," be engraved on the Capitol Visitor Center or other government buildings?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes: Our motto reflects America's religious heritage and should be displayed.

 &lt;p&gt;A nice &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19487823?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVLinkOut"&gt;new study published in a recent issue of JOSPT&lt;/a&gt; assessed the efficacy of these devices in a group of 52 subjects with lateral epicondylitis.  The study examined the amount of pain-free grip strength and maximum grip strength is subjects with a variety of tennis elbow straps, including a placebo strap.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;How Do Tennis Elbow Straps Work?&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;margin:0px 0px 0px 15px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_BsgqbRhgCnQ/Sl5swH6KS2I/AAAAAAAAAnM/ZDqkTj195cQ/image20.png?imgmax=800" width="181" height="228"&gt; The theory behind counter-force bracing is similar to the mechanics of a guitar.  When a finger is placed on a string along the neck of the guitar, it reduces tension on the string distal to the fret where your fingers are located.  A counter-force tennis elbow strap can be thought of as your fingers on the neck of the guitar (your forearm) and the extensor muscles, especially the extensor carpi radialis brevis, would be the guitar string, thus reducing tension of the muscles as they attach to the lateral epicondyle.  The authors of the study review this concept well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;Counter-force Bracing is Effective&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Results indicate that strapping was effective in allowing subjects to produce significantly more pain-free force.  Subjects were able to produce 16% more strength without pain using a strap.  There was no difference between two of the devices they used (a strap vs. a sleeve with a built in strap), indicating the strap itself is likely the significant factor.  The image below on the left is just the strap and the image on the right is the sleeve with a built in strap:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_BsgqbRhgCnQ/Sl5swmVNoeI/AAAAAAAAAnQ/4G7X0Y0H0NE/image23.png?imgmax=800" width="222" height="260"&gt; &lt;img style="border-right-width:0px;display:inline;border-top-width:0px;border-bottom-width:0px;border-left-width:0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_BsgqbRhgCnQ/Sl5sxK8KSBI/AAAAAAAAAnU/ZK6n3T145iw/image22.png?imgmax=800" width="253" height="259"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of my original concerns with the study involved the rest time between repetitions of grip strength.  As anyone that routinely assesses grip strength knows, the amount of force produced can drop significantly if the rest time between repetitions is not adequate.  However, the study design used a mean of 4 repetitions for each device and allowed 5 minutes of rest between testing sessions.  This was adequate for me and I was happy to see this methodology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;Clinical Implications&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;I like this study because bracing is simple, cheap, and effective.  People can go to any CVS or Target and get a nice tennis elbow strap these days. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Counter-force tennis elbow straps are effective at allowing patients with lateral epicondylitis to produce more grip strength with less pain. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The strap should be placed around 2.5 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;While it is unclear if the size of the strap is important, the study used straps that were between 5-8cm in width.  Considering there is some conflicting results in the literature, I would recommend you try to replicate the width of the strap.  There are some straps on the market that are very skinny. &lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Straps can be an effective way to allow people with lateral epicondyltis to return to athletics or weight lifting when painful gripping can severely limit activities. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;

Jack and Beverly Wilgus originally thought the image was of a whaler, but after posting the picture on Flick-r, they soon learned from expert whaling commenters that this was not the case (it was not a harpoon that he was holding), and they followed up on an alternative suggestion that perhaps the image was of Gage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By carefully comparing the photograph with a life mask taken of Gage's head when he was alive, and the actual tamping iron, both of which are at the &lt;a href="https://www.countway.harvard.edu/menuNavigation/historicalResources/warrenAnatomicalMuseum.html"&gt;Warren Anatomical Museum&lt;/a&gt;, the Wilgus's confirmed that the photo is indeed of Gage. For example, an inscription on the real-life tamping iron is visible in the photograph, and scars visible on Gage's life mask perfectly match up with the scars shown in the photograph.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new photo is bound to intensify the &lt;a href="http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=21&amp;amp;editionID=164&amp;amp;ArticleID=1399"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; over the effects of Gage's injuries on his personality and behaviour. "One theory about Gage — that his personality might have changed because his appearance was made grotesque by the accident (e.g., &lt;a href="http://hhs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/20/1/115"&gt;Kotowicz, 2007&lt;/a&gt;) — no longer seems credible to us," the Wilgus's said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The article is not yet publicly available but is due for imminent publication at the &lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t713658018~db=all"&gt;Journal of the History of Neurosciences&lt;/a&gt;.

Really? The BBC news team seem to think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8153168.stm"&gt;Penguin Murders Prompt Sniper Aid&lt;/a&gt;, proclaims the headline. I don’t generally enjoy falling back on dictionary definitions of things, but as my own understanding of the word murder generally involves human beings, I had to go see what consensus says. Consensus agrees. The unlawful killing of one human by another, especially with premeditated malice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike anthropomorphism, but I understand why it happens. What really puzzled me about this story, though, was this sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main suspects are dogs and foxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? We’re treating penguins as murder victims and dogs and foxes as &lt;em&gt;suspects&lt;/em&gt;? The national park has deployed snipers (that’s humans with guns) to shoot on sight any of the serial killers. I can only assume that penguins are cuter than dogs and foxes and not as numerous, and therefore not as disposable. I have no issue with interfering in the ‘natural order’ of things, but I do have an issue with painting dogs and foxes as some sort of evil-doers when they’re just doing what dogs and foxes do. As this is all taking place in Australia, I’m looking forward to the kangaroo court.&lt;/p&gt;

A scenario would be posed by the doctor leading the group, and we’d discuss possible ways of handling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, we’d get a case where religion clashed with medicine.  The classic example: A patient comes into the emergency room after having been in a bad car accident.  The patient needs a blood transfusion.  But wait!  The patient is also a Jehovah’s Witness and the religion prohibits such actions.  So what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other students around me would ask if there were any known alternative procedures… or if there were any loopholes in the religion to allow for the transfusion to occur…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to empathize.  But all I could think was that the hypothetical patient was just being ridiculous.  If they needed the transfusion, it was my job to give it to them.  If they refused it, then they would (should?) die, and so be it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t dare say that out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I admit that’s really cold and harsh.  It got worse when the hypothetical patient was the &lt;em&gt;child&lt;/em&gt; of Jehovah’s Witness parents… and they refused to let their child get a transfusion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, that’s abuse.  At that point, I don’t care about their faith at all.  My interest is in protecting the child.  And I’m not going to let someone’s absurd beliefs get in my way.  To hell with any alternatives — let’s just go with what we know works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because of an article I read in yesterday’s &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-jehovahs-witness-sw-zone-15jul15,0,6267636.story"&gt;doctors who cater to the whims of Jehovah’s Witness patients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… “A lot of [doctors] don’t want to touch Jehovah’s Witness patients because [they fear] they’ll get sued. I saw that these patients are sincere. They have a right to decide. I think they should be treated with the same respect” as anyone else making a medical choice [said Dr. Michael Tuchek.] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods used on Witness patients can create potentially harmful side effects, Tuchek said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Make the blood too thick, it can clot and cause a heart attack or stroke,” he said. “On the flip side, if you don’t give [Witnesses] the bone marrow boosting, they’re anemic and have low hemoglobin. They’re pale, they can’t breathe well, can’t exercise, they’re short of breath.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and scientists are trying to come up with new alternatives to blood transfusions, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece also mentions when Jehovah’s Witness’ children need help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“If they’re under 18, the hospitals have the right to take custody and transfuse a child, and we understand that,” [Jehovah&amp;#39;s Witness Hospital Liaison Committee chairman T.J.] Bullock said. “What the [committee] recommends is that we locate a pediatric doctor who has a good record of cooperation to maximize our position. … &lt;strong&gt;What we’re looking for is someone who is willing to push the envelope and do everything they can [to avoid a transfusion]. We try to make sure the court understands it’s not a negligent parent, it’s just a blood issue.&lt;/strong&gt;”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I’m all for progress and searching for the alternatives to blood transfusions.  That’s great if doctors and scientists can find them.  And I’m honestly happy that the doctors in the piece can care for the Jehovah’s Witness patients while still adhering to their beliefs.  And it’s nice that there’s a committee in place to help those patients whose religious beliefs require them to undergo special procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why did this piece make me mad the whole time I read it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Amway/Quixtar and MLMs: the "legal pyramid scheme," winners and losers, real businesses vs. fake businesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summary of the panel. Main thesis. Various reminders and pithy motivational quotes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the panel is finished, we&amp;#39;ll have our &amp;quot;Stump the Skeptics Q&amp;amp;A,&amp;quot; and see if the audience has some really good woo that we&amp;#39;ve never heard of before. We also plan to have a handout to give each audience member with a summary of our sources and a list of books and websites where they can find more info.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We really hope that this will go halfway well; when Magus and I went over the outline last night, he said that he sees future years where we always give an overview panel similar to this one as well as at least one specific topic panel, maybe to really unpack alternative medicine, or look in-depth at different kinds of financial scams. I'm right there with him on this. If this is even partway not crap, I want to do it again and then some.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we're really lucky, we'll get to the point that Derek from &lt;a href="http://skepticality.com"&gt;Skepticality&lt;/a&gt; did at Dragon*Con and have our own little corner of the con replete with skeptical guests and speakers from across the country, but it's best not to set our hope too high, too soon. As of now, we've only sold 8 tickets out of 100.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Stackpole, if you ever read this, get in touch! We know you'll be at Gen Con and we want to hook up with you before the panel! Send an e-mail to o[dot]kakodaimon[at]gmail[dot]com!

&lt;p&gt;Some readers may be familiar with the “Coso Artifact”, a 1920-era Champion spark plug found inside a chunk of rock. Young Earth Creationists have pointed to this as evidence against evolution. Skeptics, however, find no such proof in the artifact. When ferrous metals are buried in earth, they often rapidly form iron oxide concretions incorporating the surrounding sediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a chunk of pipe that my son found in Port Townsend, Washington last week. I presume it’s steel. Note how parts of it are completely eaten away, while other parts have ballooned to the point of filling the center of the pipe completely with just such a concretion.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber cool… it’s like our very own Coso Artifact. As it’s from Port Townsend, I’m calling it the “PoTo” Artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quickie visual inspection by me does not spot any obvious marine shells or fossils embedded within the concretion, as were said to be found in the Coso Artifact (the actual artifact is lost to time and its owner long dead). However, such items are certainly found in the much about Port Townsend, and I would have every expectation of finding them if a thorough examination were done under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, the Creationist claim to the Coso Artifact as evidence against evolution is not what you’d expect. I figured the reason was that it proves mineral formations can form in only a few decades, thus everything we see on Earth is consistent with a young age. But no, that’s not what was said at all. The Institute for Creation Research’s Donald Chittick mischaracterized it as a geode, then went on to say that the Coso Artifact proves ancient civilizations had advanced technology, which is inconsistent with “evolution”.&lt;/p&gt;

This approach has propagated a misconception that the brain has to be prodded into action. But the reality is that the brain constantly beavers away and guzzles just as much energy when we're resting doing nothing, as when we're engaged in an externally focused task. In fact, there's a default network that actually ramps up its activity levels during rest compared with when we're outwardly engaged. Such findings have prompted speculation about what all this resting brain activity is for. Possibilities include preparing for the future and mind-wandering. A new study, however, provides evidence that resting brain activity is involved in motor learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://list-albert.com/nba/nba.htm"&gt;Neil Albert&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues scanned the brains of 24 participants twice: when they were resting before a joystick task and then again resting afterwards. Crucially, half the participants performed the tracking task with a dodgy joystick that became progressively disconnected from its cursor. These participants had to adapt continuously to the changing de-synchronisation between joystick and cursor. The remaining control participants used a normal joystick. All participants also performed an irrelevant four-minute visual task prior to the final resting brain scan. This was to rule out any effects on the second resting scan that my have been caused by the participants still thinking about that dodgy joystick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initial scan of the participants at rest revealed a number of resting state networks: suites of inter-connected brain regions pulsing away in unison. In the brains of the participants who had to adapt to the dodgy joystick, but not the control participants, the strength of one of these - a fronto-parietal network - was greater in the second resting scan, as if it was still particularly busy consolidating the earlier motor learning. A second resting network, incorporating the cauliflower-like cerebellum at the back of the brain, also grew in strength in the brains of the participants who had to adapt to the dodgy joystick, whereas this network wasn't even present in the control participants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These findings suggest that it was specifically learning to control the dodgy joystick, not joystick use per se, that led to increased activity in two resting state networks. "We have shown that motor learning, but not motor performance, can modulate particular resting state networks," the researchers said. "Our results add a new dimension to our understanding of the resting brain and potentially provide a powerful new technique to examine the neuronal machinery of off-line processing," they concluded.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/25_rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Current+Biology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.cub.2009.04.028&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=The+Resting+Human+Brain+and+Motor+Learning&amp;amp;rft.issn=09609822&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=19&amp;amp;rft.issue=12&amp;amp;rft.spage=1023&amp;amp;rft.epage=1027&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982209010264&amp;amp;rft.au=Albert%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Robertson%2C+E.&amp;amp;rft.au=Miall%2C+R.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CNeuroscience%2CCognitive+Neuroscience"&gt;Albert, N., Robertson, E., &amp;amp; Miall, R.

To say that Jim and I "rarely" go out to the movies is a bit of an understatement. The last film we saw at the cinema was &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0327056/"&gt;Mystic River&lt;/a&gt;; before that, it was &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118147/"&gt;When We Were Kings&lt;/a&gt; (the latter I particularly recommend, and I am no fan of boxing). Thanks to DVDs, Netflix, and YouTube, we manage to get some movie-watching in though, to be sure, there is nothing like seeing a film in an actual theater with the smell of the popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all apologies to Sacha Baron Cohen, &lt;a href="http://www.thebrunomovie.com/"&gt;Brüno&lt;/a&gt;---the mock documentary about a gay Austrian fashion journalist seeking fame and notoriety in the US---is not the movie that we would be seeing if we were to see one. Nonetheless, I have been reading &lt;a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/movies/10bruno.html"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/film_reviews/article6674663.ece"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; which (call me squeamish) have further given me reason to feel this film would not be my choice for a movie date with Jim, although Jim and I did get into a conversation about &lt;a href="http://www.thebrunomovie.com/"&gt;Brüno&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also about Bruno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; Bruno. You know who I mean, all you autism folk out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://unstrange.com/bettelheim.html"&gt;Bruno Bettelheim&lt;/a&gt;, the "self-styled expert on child development" who stated that autism is caused by "bad," emotionally "frigid" parents who wish that their child did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides sharing a moniker, there's some other coincidinks between  &lt;a href="http://www.thebrunomovie.com/"&gt;Brüno&lt;/a&gt; and Bruno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Austrians. (And here are two more: &lt;a href="http://unstrange.com/asperger.html"&gt;Hans Asperger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://unstrange.com/kanner.html"&gt;Leo Kanner&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Was gibt mit dieser? Ich weiss nicht, aber.....&lt;/i&gt;... dunno, but....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The basic premise of the movie," according to the &lt;a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/blockbuster_buzz/2009/07/br%C3%BCno-the-buzz-review.html"&gt;Times Online&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/blockbuster_buzz/2009/07/br%C3%BCno-the-buzz-review.html"&gt;Blockbuster Buzz&lt;/a&gt; blog,  is this: "Naive overseas visitor exposes the not-so-secret craziness of assorted American stereotypes with a cavalcade of crude, daft and from some perspectives offensive gags." &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Naive overseas visitor?" Bettelheim (Bruno #2) was the son of a lumber merchant trained in art history who came to the US in the 1940s and procured a position at Rockford College in Illinois; he was a professor of education and of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Chicago for most of his career. He did not have formal training in medicine or in child psychiatry. He did, though, "expose" the "craziness" of some American parents who (these crazy Americans) had caused their young children to become withdrawn emotionally and otherwise---to be autistic----and who had therefore to be taken away from their parents and treated by "experts" (Bettelheim). While the protocols used at his Orthogenic School in Chicago were not "gags," when one reads of the school (see &lt;a href="http://www.richardpollak.com/the_creation_of_dr__b__a_biography_of_bruno_bettelheim__i__27132.htm"&gt;Richard Pollak's The Creation of Dr. B.&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.unstrange.com"&gt;Roy Richard Grinker's Unstrange Minds&lt;/a&gt;), one wants to gag, for its crudity, daftness, and simple offensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipe for "treating" autistic, disabled children is to take them away from their parents and put them in an unfamiliar environment or facility with therapists who (compared to parents) are strangers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People say all the time, how horrible. People say, how could anyone believe that? People say, we know better now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But oh no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just recently, we heard someone say to us that we needed to do what is "best for our family" as far as Charlie. As far as his education. As far as his placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what do you think it feels like to have someone else tell you, the parents of a disabled child, that your child might, would, be better off away from you, in a "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hard_hard_questions_residential_placement"&gt;temporary residential placement&lt;/a&gt;"? Shouldn't the family members make those judgements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sure know what &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/refrigeratormothers/"&gt;these mothers&lt;/a&gt; felt, is what I have to say. And that, maybe my experience is a lot closer to theirs than I would like to think. Sure we don't have doctors telling us that, to do what is "best" for the family, our child needs to be taken away from us. It seems that others &lt;i&gt;[fill in the blank]&lt;/i&gt; have taken up the baton of parent blame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like, maybe there is more of Bruno in &lt;a href="http://www.thebrunomovie.com/"&gt;Brüno&lt;/a&gt; than might be at all apparent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Self-styled expert on child development." Self-promoting, self-humiliating, expert (of sorts) of getting us to see (and chortle) at the basic, elemental, atavistic, &lt;i&gt;childish&lt;/i&gt;, ignorant preconceptions that we still hold in ourselves at gut level (and which we like to think we are "beyond"), who is of course the cousin of for reals autism expert &lt;a href="http://www.autismresearchcentre.com/arc/staff_member.asp?id=33"&gt;Simon Baron Cohen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;i&gt;autism&lt;/i&gt;---it's a word from the ancient Greek word &lt;i&gt;autos&lt;/i&gt; which means self (and "same," and some other things). And are Baron Cohen's films not all about one character, one &lt;i&gt;self&lt;/i&gt;, alone and up against the world seeking to make that world see how wrong and deluded it is, how subject to stereotypes and mis- and perceptions about other people, and how stupid people, we, us, really are; oh how doth the stupid burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what &lt;a href="http://www.thebrunomovie.com/"&gt;Brüno&lt;/a&gt; exposes and what Bruno, the other Bruno, sought to show to parents of autistic children, parents who were unable to see that they, and they alone, were the sole cause of their child's withdrawal, problems, and disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Bruno was so very very wrong and yet his ideas have had a strangely lasting effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Baron Cohen, if I may, I think there may be a topic for a new project here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do pursue it, please do not spare your satire and your send-ups. And as for the box office, well, I can at least almost guarantee you that this is a myth about autism that everyone (of whatever beliefs about what causes autism, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/aba_and_neurodiversity_not_so_strange_bedfellows"&gt;neurodiversity&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole lot more that is thought &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/division_revisited"&gt;divisive&lt;/a&gt;) would like to see ground down into the ground and exposed, and lampooned, and stood on its head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brüno, please meet &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQY2oB3Rqdg"&gt;Bruno&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

This is the critical thinking conference hosted by the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;James Randi Educational Foundation&lt;/a&gt; held annually in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also revived our SF Bay Area Skeptics lecture series. This commenced with "Are We Alone?", a fascinating talk by &lt;strong&gt;Dan Werthimer&lt;/strong&gt;, Chief Scientist of the &lt;a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/"&gt;SETI@home&lt;/a&gt; project at the University of California, Berkeley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also been holding regular &lt;strong&gt;Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/strong&gt; events throughout the Bay Area; including a night with Skeptics' Guide to the Universe's &lt;strong&gt;Jay Novella&lt;/strong&gt;, and Skeptical Inquirer's &lt;strong&gt;Ben Radford&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Their answer? Yes. (Come to think of it, why didn’t they just ask me? The reader comments below the story are worth reading. They seem like a roundup of common feelings and fears.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tara Parker-Pope ran a Q&lt;a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/for-mothers-the-stress-of-autism/?apage=1#comments"&gt;&amp;amp;A &lt;/a&gt;with Annette Estes, the center’s associate director, to discuss the findings. No bolts of lightening here, at least for me.  What was interesting was their inability to track down the source of the stress. Estes said it was not the extra work itself of parenting a child with autism — assisting with daily living skills and so on — but something they couldn’t quite pinpoint. Hopelessness, fear of the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad someone is examining the emotions and feelings of parents like me and Jeff. I know we all respond to things differently, and some people do not experience the same fears and anxiety we do, but I also that plenty of other parents are miserable and afraid and sad. I guess I often feel sad concerning Alex, and the very fact that I feel sad makes me sad, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8127000/8127519.stm"&gt;A single mega-colony of ants has successfully taken over the world&lt;/a&gt;. It’s finally happened! The Earth has been taken over–’conquered’, if you will, by a master race of ants. It’s difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive earth men or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain, there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Argentine ants living in vast numbers across Europe, the US and Japan belong to the same inter-related colony, and will refuse to fight one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colony may be the largest of its type ever known for any insect species, and could rival humans in the scale of its world domination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, people are unwittingly helping the mega-colony stick together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argentine ants (&lt;em&gt;Linepithema humile&lt;/em&gt;) were once native to South America. But people have unintentionally introduced the ants to all continents except Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Europe, one vast colony of Argentine ants is thought to stretch for 6,000km (3,700 miles) along the Mediterranean coast, while another in the US, known as the “Californian large”, extends over 900km (560 miles) along the coast of California. A third huge colony exists on the west coast of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ants are usually highly territorial, those living within each super-colony are tolerant of one another, even if they live tens or hundreds of kilometres apart. Each super-colony, however, was thought to be quite distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it now appears that billions of Argentine ants around the world all actually belong to one single global mega-colony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords. I’d like to remind them that I can be helpful in rounding up others to…toil in their underground sugar caves.&lt;/p&gt;

The National Health Service office in Sheffield, England has taken a very interesting approach to sex education. &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/5806691/NHS-tells-school-children-of-their-right-to-an-orgasm-a-day.html"&gt;They’ve begun distributing a leaflet entitled “Pleasure” in school sex education classes&lt;/a&gt; that talks about the health benefits of a happy sex life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaflet carries the slogan “an orgasm a day keeps the doctor away”. It also says: “Health promotion experts advocate five portions of fruit and veg a day and 30 minutes’ physical activity three times a week. What about sex or masturbation twice a week?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Slack, the director of the Centre for HIV and Sexual Health at NHS Sheffield, who is one of the leaflet’s authors, says that instead of promoting teenage sex, it could encourage young people to delay losing their virginity until they are certain they will enjoy the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Slack believes that if teenagers are fully informed about sex and are making their decisions of their own will in a loving relationship, they have an equal right as an adult to an enjoyable sex life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony Seldon, the headmaster of Wellington College, which recently introduced classes in emotional wellbeing, said the leaflets were “deplorable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the company admitted no wrongdoing, under the settlement, Airborne Health Inc. will discontinue any claims about the “health benefit, performance, efficacy or safety” of its supplements in preventing and treating colds and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/5314744/500000-in-consumer-refunds-from-rite-aid-after-false-cold-remedy-advertising-suit"&gt;Well, now there’s a new Airborne falling out of the sky, Germ Defense&lt;/a&gt;. Germ Defense is another &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; cold “remedy” like Airborne (and right next to it on the shelves) sold at Rite Aid, which now must pay $500,000 in refunds to customers who bought this product that doesn’t actually do anything. . . unless we change the definition of “anything” to include nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer of Germ Defense, &lt;a href="http://www.herbalremedies.com/improvita.html"&gt;Improvita&lt;/a&gt;, has also been charged with &lt;a title="Click here to read more posts tagged FALSE ADVERTISING" href="http://consumerist.com/tag/false-advertising/"&gt;false advertising&lt;/a&gt;. If you bought Germ Defense tablets or lozenges, you’re eligible for a refund of the value of up to six packages of the supplement. From the FTC’s &lt;a href="http://www2.ftc.gov/opa/2009/07/riteaide.shtm"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Airborne Health, Inc., which settled deceptive advertising charges with the FTC last&lt;br&gt;
year for marketing its effervescent tablets as a cold prevention and treatment remedy, Rite Aid will settle similar charges for selling a purported cold-and-flu remedy under its private label. Rite Aid will pay $500,000 for consumer redress under the agreed-upon final order. The company is required to post a refund notice, along with postage-pre-paid refund request forms, in a clear and conspicuous location in the cold-and-flu aisle at each of its stores for 60 days beginning on October 1, 2009. Consumers will have until December 31, 2009 to submit refund requests for up to six packages of Germ Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also under the settlement agreement, Rite Aid may not claim that any Rite-Aid-label version of Airborne, or any Rite-Aid-label food, drug, or dietary supplement can reduce the risk of or prevent colds or flu, reduce the severity or duration of colds, or boost the immune system unless the claims are truthful, not misleading, and substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rite Aid and Improvita marketed several flavors of Germ Defense lozenges and tablets as&lt;br&gt;
dietary supplements that contained vitamins C and E, zinc, and echinacea. They claimed the products could reduce the risk of or prevent colds and flu; protect against or fight germs; reduce the severity or duration of a cold; protect against colds and flu in crowded places; and boost the immune system, according to the complaints. The FTC charged that there is inadequate evidence to support these claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again though, the government is failing to really do its job. Ultimately this product is still going to be on shelves with only slightly different wording on the same shelf by the REAL cold medicine. The packaging will say some vague bullshit instead that can’t be legally fought like “Promotes healing” or “Improves immune system,” etc. So other than taking a little cash from them, these assholes will continue to sell their nonsense to those who assume their pharmacy isn’t selling them junk and who won’t have any idea that it doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It blows my mind that the federal government time and time again refuses to take any real action and shut down these criminal operations.&lt;/p&gt;

And you’d think that those who believe the Earth is doomed anyway, that there is no such thing as death because we all have an eternal soul, and that those god deems worthy of eternal torture in the afterlife will get there eventually anyway would be a little more patient. What’s your hurry, buddy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; getting your father to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Osteen#Biography"&gt;bequeath&lt;/a&gt; you his megachurch
&lt;li&gt; getting your father to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garner_Ted_Armstrong"&gt;bequeath&lt;/a&gt; you his radio ministry
&lt;li&gt; getting your father to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Graham"&gt;bequeath&lt;/a&gt; you his evangelistic association
&lt;li&gt; getting your father to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Schuller"&gt;bequeath&lt;/a&gt; you his crystal cathedral
&lt;li&gt; getting your father to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jones,_Jr."&gt;bequeath&lt;/a&gt; you his fundamentalist college
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly less popular career trajectories include &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Warren#Career"&gt;skipping school&lt;/a&gt; to hear W.A. Criswell preach, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carman_%28singer%29#Early_life"&gt;experiencing&lt;/a&gt; an “Andrae Crouch” concert, and dropping out of college to become a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Roberts#Early_life"&gt;traveling faith healer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when all else fails, you can always try &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/440/story/1326704.html"&gt;driving from Alabama to Washington to have sex with a teenage runaway you met playing “World of Warcraft”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jones pleaded guilty in April to a federal charge of interstate travel for illicit sexual conduct. He apologized to the victim and her family on Tuesday and said he hoped to find a career as a minister after serving his prison term.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there are many things to link. We’re starting to do radio interviews about the book, for instance, and a good one just went up with “Word of Mouth,” a show on New Hampshire Public Radio hosted by Virginia Prescott. You can &lt;a href="http://www.nhpr.org/node/26031"&gt;listen here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/07/hold-of-holdren-again/"&gt;latest Science Progress column&lt;/a&gt; also just went up–it’s another defense of Obama science adviser John Holdren, now being attacked for positions he didn’t hold thirty years ago due to misreadings of a book on which he was the third author. In other words, typical right wing attacks, all smoke no fire, and an utter distraction from what’s important for the country. You can read my defense &lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/07/hold-of-holdren-again/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/todaysbuzz/thursday/sfl-atheist-religion-capitol-buzz-fins-m071609,0,7520979.story"&gt;ran an absurd letter&lt;/a&gt; today by &lt;strong&gt;Antonio Fins&lt;/strong&gt;, a man who wants to see the words engraved into the CVC and who doesn’t even understand the irony of his own comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let’s start by pointing out the First Amendment doesn’t grant freedom “from” religion, just freedom “of” religion. It doesn’t ban religion, &lt;strong&gt;it provides freedom for all so that one denomination doesn’t dominate or become the official state religion…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one is forced to worship because they saw the motto on a $20 bill. Or because they recited the Pledge of Allegiance. It’s pretty innocuous.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s just too much ignorance in those sentences to dissect it all right now.  Needless to say, Fin would be saying something completely different if, each day, he had to recite that we’re “One Nation, Under Many Gods”… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the newspaper has a poll up asking your thoughts on the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/todaysbuzz/thursday/sfl-atheist-religion-capitol-buzz-fins-m071609,0,7520979.story"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/CVC.JPG" alt="CVC" title="CVC" width="208" height="266"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the results are going in the wrong direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/todaysbuzz/thursday/sfl-atheist-religion-capitol-buzz-fins-m071609,0,7520979.story"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/CVCResponse.JPG" alt="CVCResponse" title="CVCResponse" width="575" height="178"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s &lt;a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/opinion/todaysbuzz/thursday/sfl-atheist-religion-capitol-buzz-fins-m071609,0,7520979.story"&gt;Pharyngulate that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… just remind yourself that things have been crawling on top of each other and madly humping away for &lt;em&gt;850 million years&lt;/em&gt;. Sex came first, then humanity (200,000ish years ago), then religion came along tens of thousands of years after that. Which may explain why religion, when pitted against sex (really old) and human nature (pretty old), always loses. &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" width="50"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Date&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" width="200"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" width="200"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1776&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;Writes the Declaration of Independence&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1809&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ends his term as President of the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;born&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1823&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" width="200"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writes the quote Stephen Meyer will find so appealing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hold (without appeal to revelation) that when we take a view of the Universe, in its parts general or particular, it is impossible for the human mind not to perceive and feel a conviction of design, consummate skill, and indefinite power in every atom of its composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;14 years old.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;


&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;1826&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;Darwin is a student at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1831&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voyage of the Beagle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1859&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publishes the &lt;i&gt;Origin&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1882&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still very dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" style="padding:8px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darwin dies, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do overlap a bit in time, but Jefferson was 33 years in the grave before Darwin got around to explaining how we don't need a designer to explain the living universe. I rather suspect that no ship was dispatched from Virginia to Shropshire to get young Charlie Darwin's rebuttal of the 1823 claim, either. It's even less likely that Jefferson's zombie rose up in 1859 to take a quick gander at these new ideas spreading through biology and decided, nah, he likes intelligent design better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could be wrong. Maybe the Biologic Institute has been holding seances and has received Jefferson&amp;#39;s imprimatur — I wouldn&amp;#39;t put it past them. Otherwise, though, Meyer is making a ludicrously stupid argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, even if the DI had Jefferson's revivified head in a jar, and it was making anti-evolutionary pronouncements, it wouldn't make a bit of difference to evolutionary biologists. Doctors might be excited, though.&lt;/p&gt;

Protesters blockaded the governor's office for The People's Day of Reckoning, and refused to leave, resulting in 15 citations.  While not popular with the governor, several legislators cheered on the protesters, and let them know their concerns were important and they were not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. history book chapter "Civil Rights Movements You've Never Heard Of," is the note that the disability rights movement has not been shy about using civil disobedience to make its point.  From the &lt;a href="http://www.independentliving.org/docs4/ervin1986.html"&gt;mass sit-ins&lt;/a&gt; that lead to the signing of the 504 back in the 70's to the recent &lt;a href="http://corzinewatch2.wordpress.com/"&gt;New Jersey protests&lt;/a&gt; that preserved funding for Independent Living Centers, making an enormous, unavoidable, messy scene is sometimes what it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's hoping that there are some agreeable (to the protesters) resolutions in California soon.&lt;/p&gt;

When reading about alternative medicine, you'll often encounter charismatic leaders, faith in the unknowable, and conversion experiences.  &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-patricia-fitzgerald/what-inspired-a-scientist_b_228356.html"&gt;A fine example of the latter&lt;/a&gt; is currently up at the Huffington Post.  It's written by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/who_is_patricia_fitzgerald_and.php"&gt;"Dr" Patricia Fitzgerald,&lt;/a&gt; HuffPo's "wellness editor".  Just to remind you of her credentials, she is a "Licensed Acupuncturist, Cert. Clinical Nutritionist, Homeopath, [and] Author."  In other words, she's not a doctor in any well-recognized sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her reasonably interesting interview is of Susan Smalley (who could rightly be called "Dr", having a legitimate PhD).  Smalley is a former scientist who had a typical conversion experience parroted credulously by Fitzgerald.  Unlike actual medical knowledge, Smalley's knowledge is "received" rather than rationally developed. It is faith, not science.  That's just fine, except that UCLA is actually paying good money to sponsor this new religion under the guise of science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/medicine_and_belief_part_n1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/medicine_and_belief_part_n1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/p9UNog6-E-8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247700183702"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/anthro_blog_carnival_48.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/73652f60f0f3f915</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Anthro Blog carnival</title><published>2009-07-15T22:00:15Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T22:00:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/DMQY0ojaDAE/anthro_blog_carnival_48.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/anthro_blog_carnival_48.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The seventy-first &lt;a href="http://fourstonehearth.net/"&gt;Four Stone Hearth&lt;/a&gt; blog carnival is on-line at &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://neuroanthropology.net/2009/07/15/four-stone-hearth-71-australiana-edition/"&gt;Neuroanthropology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;But now, a Christian Right group is &lt;a href="http://www.familiesunitedmission.com/?q=news/families-united-statement-aclu-joining-military-funeral-protest-ban"&gt;attacking the ACLU&lt;/a&gt; for supporting… another Christian Right group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merrilee Carlson&lt;/strong&gt;, the President of Families United For Our Troops and Their Mission (I don’t think they mean &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; families, though, you heathen scum), &lt;a href="http://www.familiesunitedmission.com/?q=news/families-united-statement-aclu-joining-military-funeral-protest-ban"&gt;sent out a press release&lt;/a&gt; because the ACLU was defending &lt;strong&gt;Fred Phelps&lt;/strong&gt; and the Westboro Baptist Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there’s a Christian out there thinking, “WBC?  They’re not real Christians; they’re a hate group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hate group, yes.  But no doubt they believe they’re accurately following the Bible.  They’re just not &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; kind of Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And perhaps unfortunately, Phelps’ clan has the same rights as everyone else — including free speech and the right to peacefully protest.  That’s what the ACLU is defending.  They’re not supporting what the WBC is doing, simply their right to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the same reason the Ku Klux Klan would receive similar protection from the ACLU, the same reason pro-lifers who wanted to peacefully protest in front of an abortion clinic would be defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACLU doesn’t take on cases just because they support some progressive agenda; they’re here to protect civil liberties for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;.  Free speech is protected even if it’s vile and abhorrent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why attack them?  &lt;a href="http://www.familiesunitedmission.com/?q=news/families-united-statement-aclu-joining-military-funeral-protest-ban"&gt;Carlson says this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“My son died in Iraq fighting to protect the Constitutional rights and liberties that the ACLU is now trying to exploit. This lawsuit proves the ACLU will stop at nothing to drive an agenda that disrespects and degrades our fallen heroes and their families…”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right… the ACLU hates the troops.  That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And talk about exploitation, at the &lt;a href="http://www.familiesunitedmission.com/?q=news/families-united-statement-aclu-joining-military-funeral-protest-ban"&gt;bottom of the note&lt;/a&gt; is a message that Carlson’s son was killed in Iraq in 2005 — the same note that is on several press releases — as if that gives Carlson the right to make ludicrous statements.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post, I focus on their discussion of the mainstream media and of the blogosphere.  You might guess, given that I'm a member of the science blogosphere, that I have some pretty strong views about what blogs might accomplish in terms of helping the public engage with science.  You would be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fair portion of &lt;a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780465013050"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America:  How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/book_review_unscientific_ameri.php"&gt;reviewed here&lt;/a&gt;) explores conditions of American life that make it harder for the public meaningfully to engage in science -- or easier for them to disengage.  Prominently featured here are the changes that newspapers and television have experienced in recent decades.  Mooney and Kirshenbaum write:&lt;br&gt;

You can check out what the greatest discoveries were (in my opinion) from the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1919_einste.php"&gt;1910s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1929_hubble.php"&gt;1920s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_the_1930s_a.php"&gt;1930s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1948_gamow.php"&gt;1940s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1950s_the_t.php"&gt;1950s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1969_and_th.php"&gt;1960s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be.php"&gt;1970s&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe.php"&gt;1980s&lt;/a&gt;.  By this point, we understood the origin of the Universe as well as we understand it today, knew about dark matter and normal matter, and were trying to figure out what the fate of the Universe was.  It started with a bang (of course), with a supremely hot (~10^20 degrees), dense, and rapidly expanding state (image courtesy of &lt;a href="http://www.outsideinthemovie.com/"&gt;Stephen van Vuuren&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/06/makin/big-bang.jpg" width="512" alt="bigbang"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that there were (and are) two things going on, fighting each other for supremacy.  On one hand, everything -- each single particle -- in the young Universe had a tremendous amount of energy.  Each particle was flying apart from every other particle as fast as they possibly could.  On the other hand, you have gravity, fighting to pull everything back together, and trying to recollapse matter.  It's pretty easy to see that on (relatively) small scales, gravity can win, as gravitational collapse has led to the formation of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies we observe today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/galaxy-cluster-abell1689-desk-1280.jpg" width="512" alt="galaxy-cluster-abell1689-desk-1280.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens on the largest scale?  What happens on the scale of the &lt;b&gt;entire Universe&lt;/b&gt;?  You've got this rapidly expanding Universe, and gravity fighting the expansion.  As we saw it, there were three options.
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;On one extreme, perhaps gravity can do it.  Perhaps it's so powerful that it can take this expanding Universe and pull it back together, causing it to recollapse and end in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch"&gt;big crunch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other far extreme, perhaps the expansion is just too powerful.  Perhaps gravity can slow the expansion, but never stop it, and certainly never reverse it.  In this case, the Universe &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe"&gt;freezes to death&lt;/a&gt;, and simply coasts off into infinity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And there's the "Goldilocks" situation.  The first option gets too hot, the second option gets too cold, but maybe the Universe is balanced &lt;i&gt;just right&lt;/i&gt;.  Perhaps gravity can slow the expansion rate down towards zero, but will never cause it to recollapse.  This borderline case, on the cusp between coasting forever and recollapsing, is called &lt;a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/ChristinaCheng.shtml"&gt;a critical Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
Illustrated, the three possibilities look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/3classicalcases.jpg" width="344" height="338" alt="3classicalcases.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time that scientists were considering these three options, technology had improved to the point where we -- for the first time -- could seriously consider answering this question.  The dawn of the 1990s brought us to the launch of the first high-quality &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/"&gt;space telescope&lt;/a&gt;, Hubble:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/hstorbitx.jpg" width="512" alt="hstorbitx.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could now see farther and clearer than ever before, and through a brilliant trick, we could finally hope to measure the entire expansion history of the Universe.  Learning what the Universe did in the past would allow us to figure out what it was &lt;i&gt;going&lt;/i&gt; to do in the future.  So how do we figure it out, and what's the answer?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a 100 Watt light bulb.  You know how &lt;i&gt;intrinsically&lt;/i&gt; bright it is, right?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/_45355523_-17.jpg" width="512" alt="_45355523_-17.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also know that the farther away it is, the dimmer it appears.  In fact, all you have to do is measure its &lt;i&gt;observed&lt;/i&gt; brightness and you can figure out how far away it has to be!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there aren't 100 Watt bulbs in space, but there is something close enough that operates under the same principle: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova"&gt;Type Ia supernovae&lt;/a&gt;.  All you need is a white dwarf star that orbits another, larger star:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/binary_sml.jpg" width="500" alt="binary_sml.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white dwarf starts to steal mass from the larger star.  When the white dwarf reaches a certain mass -- about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit"&gt;1.4 times the mass of our Sun&lt;/a&gt; -- the white dwarf becomes unstable, collapses, and then explodes!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/picture-16.png" width="512" alt="picture-16.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is common enough that it happens all over the Universe, producing a Type Ia supernova.  These are also &lt;i&gt;standard&lt;/i&gt; enough that we can use these to measure distances the same way we would measure the distance to a 100 Watt light bulb by measuring its brightness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By also measuring the speed that the supernova is moving away from us (remember &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1929_hubble.php"&gt;Hubble's Law and the expanding Universe&lt;/a&gt;?), we then know &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; how far away it is &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; how fast it's moving.  Combine those two pieces of information for enough supernovae, and you learn the expansion history of the Universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what was it doing?  Was it going to recollapse?  Was it going to coast off into infinity?  Was it right on the edge?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/adamsaul.jpg" width="500" alt="adamsaul.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To &lt;i&gt;everyone's&lt;/i&gt; surprise, it was doing &lt;b&gt;none of those things&lt;/b&gt;.  In 1998, two separate teams -- one led by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Perlmutter"&gt;Saul Perlmutter&lt;/a&gt; and the other by &lt;a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~ariess/"&gt;Adam Riess&lt;/a&gt; -- announced that the Universe looked like it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a critical Universe, and then all of a sudden, the expansion rate refused to slow down anymore.  Instead of recollapsing, coasting, or riding on the brink of both, the Universe &lt;b&gt;was and is accelerating!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th/Universe_fate.jpg" width="500" alt="Universe_fate.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, this was the greatest discovery of the 1990s, and one of the most revolutionary discoveries of the entire 20th century.  The Universe won't end with a crunch nor with a coast, but with an expansion rate that continues to push things away from us farther and faster.  If we lived another 100 billion years, we would find that -- after we merged with Andromeda -- every other galaxy in the Universe was gone from our sight, pushed away by this accelerated expansion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early 1998 results were, of course, questioned, but they have held up, and subsequent data overwhelmingly supports an accelerating Universe.  Enjoy the night sky while we have it, because someday everything beyond our own galaxy will be hopelessly out of reach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1998_and_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247695627671"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3175">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f1b13d0c78bb041b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="fiction"/><title type="html">Recommended reading: fiction</title><published>2009-07-15T21:16:03Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T21:16:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/recommended-reading-fiction/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, it’s not science, but I’ve been meaning for a while to put up a short list of fiction that I’ve enjoyed and want to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raj-Quartet-Scorpion-Everymans-Library/dp/0307263967"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Raj Quartet&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(1966-1975) by Paul Scott.  This, I think, is the greatest semi-obscure work of English-language fiction of the 20th century.  It’s a series of four novels, and a sequel (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Staying-Phoenix-Fiction-Paul-Scott/dp/0226743497"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staying On&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 1977), about the end of the British occupation of India.  Like &lt;em&gt;A Passage to India&lt;/em&gt;, its centerpiece is a purported case of rape, limning the ambiguous and difficult relationship between India and Britain. You may have seen the BBC television adaptation, &lt;em&gt;The Jewel in the Crown&lt;/em&gt; (also the title of one of the novels). If you’re a fan of luscious Fitzgeraldian prose and finely-woven plot, this is for you.   &lt;em&gt;Staying On&lt;/em&gt; won the 1977 Booker Prize. This is a great book to take on a long trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Pi-Yann-Martel/dp/0156027321"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life of Pi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;(2001) by Yann Martel.  Another Booker winner (2002), it’s a must-read if you love animals, biology, and fiction.  I can’t say too much about this one because I’m recommending it as summer reading in an upcoming issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.

When you open a McCarthy book, you are immediately thrust into a unique and mesmerising world that you’ll either love or hate.  McCarthy’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Border-Trilogy-Crossing-Everymans-Library/dp/0375407936/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1247692325&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Border Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, three novels written later (and also set in Texas/Mexico), are nearly but not quite as good as &lt;em&gt;Blood Meridian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Dyer"&gt;Geoff Dyer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a writer whom I recently discovered. Dyer is a fantastic writer with an amazing range. His jazz/fact/fiction novel,&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/But-Beautiful-Book-about-Jazz/dp/0865475083/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1247692362&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;But Beautiful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is a must if you love jazz, and his small collection of reviews and other nonfiction, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anglo-English-Attitudes-Geoff-Dyer/dp/0349111952/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1247692465&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Anglo-English Attitudes: Essays, Reviews, Misadventures&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is a good introduction to his breadth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not really — my title is a bit of a sensationalistic exploitation of the thesis of a paper by Peterson, Dietrich, and McPeek, but I can buy into their idea that microRNAs (miRNAs) may have contributed to the pattern of metazoan phylogenies we see now. It&amp;#39;s actually a thought-provoking concept, especially to someone who favors the evo-devo view of animal evolution. And actually, the question it answers is why we haven&amp;#39;t had thousands of Cambrian explosions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you haven't been keeping up, miRNAs are a hot topic in molecular genetics: they are short (21-23 nucleotides) pieces of single stranded RNA that are not translated into protein, but have their effect by binding to other strands of messenger RNA (mRNA) to which they complement, effectively down-regulating expression of that messenger. They play an important role in regulating the levels of expression of other genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One role for miRNAs seems to be to act as a kind of biological buffer, working to limit the range of effective message that can be operating in the cell at any one time. Some experiments that have knocked out specific miRNAs have had a very interesting effect: the &lt;i&gt;range&lt;/i&gt; of expressed phenotypes for the targeted message gene increases. The presence or absence of miRNA doesn&amp;#39;t actually generate a novel phenotype, it simply fine-tunes what other genes do — and without miRNA, some genes become sloppy in their expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk of buffering expression immediately swivels a developmental biologist&amp;#39;s mind to another term: canalization. Canalization is a process that leads organisms to produce similar phenotypes despite variations in genotype or the environment (within limits, of course). Development is a fairly robust process that overcomes genetic variations and external events to yield a moderately consistent outcome — I can raise fish embryos at 20°C or at 30°C, and despite differences in the overall rate of growth, the resultant adult fish are indistinguishable. This is also true of populations in evolution: stasis is the norm, morphologies don&amp;#39;t swing too widely generation after generation, but still, we can get some rapid (geologically speaking) shifts, as if forms are switching between a couple of stable nodes of attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the Cambrian comes into this is that it is the greatest example of a flowering of new forms, which then all began diverging down different evolutionary tracks. The curious thing isn&amp;#39;t their appearance — there is evidence of a diversity of forms before the Cambrian, bacteria had been flourishing for a few billion years, etc., and what happened 500 million years ago is that the forms became visible in the fossil record with the evolution of hard body parts — but that these phyla established body plans that they were then locked into, to varying degrees, right up to the modern day. What the authors are proposing is that miRNAs might be part of the explanation for why these lineages were subsequently channeled into discrete morphological pathways, each distinct from the other as chordates and arthropods and echinoderms and molluscs.&lt;/p&gt;

It has become so long that I have decided to break it up into several parts. Today is Part I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, I am not a medical professional. I am a PhD, not an MD, so this is not medical advice. And in fact, I am quite sure there are anthropologists out there who do not share my opinion, so this is not even anthropological advice. This is just one person’s perspective on a medication so pervasive few people even think of it as the serious prescription that it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hormonal birth control has been around for many decades, and has seen many improvements, reductions in dosage, and different ways of accessing the medication, from a shot, to a patch, a ring or a pill. Hormonal birth control is used off-label for mood stabilization and acne, and increasingly these contraceptives are also approved for these non-contraceptive purposes. You’ve probably seen the ads of skinny-armed women punching at “irritability” and “bloating” in bubble letters before them with a girly rendition of “We’re not gonna take it” in the background. You’ve seen the slightly more “empowered” ads that have cropped up recently regarding the hormonal contraception that you can take continuously to avoid your period, where far stronger women are staring right into the camera and daring you to doubt their decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With my feminist mindset, these ads are pretty much enough to make me think that these drugs are harmful to women, because they are 1) focusing on the non-birth control aspects of the drug in order to increase the number of consumers and 2) trying to frame the debate about contraception with a watery version of "choice" feminism. However, and this is a big however, how one feels about a commercial is not a good enough reason to dismiss a medication used by, I am guessing, a majority of reproductively aged women in this country. I was recently annoyed by a Tylenol ad, but you better believe I gave my daughter acetaminophen last week when she had a temperature of 104. I am able to get off my high horse, folks, and I’d like to do that today to discuss some recent evidence around hormonal contraception that suggests it is not the cure-all we want it to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contraindications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let’s just get these out of the way first. If you read the packaging and/or you have a doctor worth his/her salt, you know if you have high blood pressure, a history of blood clots or liver dysfunction, you should not take hormonal contraception. End of story, and don’t try to get around it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But do you know that if your BMI is over 25 you are at an increased risk of unintended pregnancies? The dosage for hormonal contraception was designed for average to low-average weight women from developed countries. Brunner Huber and Hogue (2005) found that contracepting overweight and obese women had twice the odds of an unintended pregnancy compared to normal weight women. Burkman et al (2009) recently found similar results, but the relationship was not quite statistically significant. The results do seem to vary somewhat with which contraceptive is being tested. But with the average American woman’s BMI at 28, it seems as though today’s oral contraceptives may not be effective for a majority of our country’s population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomorrow, I’ll discuss what it means to have a “normal” menstrual cycle, and how this relates to the prevalence of hormonal contraceptives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Maternal+and+Child+Health+Journal&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=The+association+between+body+weight%2C+unintended+pregnancy+resulting+in+a+livebirth%2C+and+contraception+at+the+time+of+conception&amp;amp;rft.issn=&amp;amp;rft.date=2005&amp;amp;rft.volume=9&amp;amp;rft.issue=4&amp;amp;rft.spage=413&amp;amp;rft.epage=420&amp;amp;rft.artnum=&amp;amp;rft.au=Brunner+Huber+LR&amp;amp;rft.au=Hogue+CJ&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Anthropology%2CHealth%2CBiological+Anthropology%2C+Medicine"&gt;Brunner Huber LR, &amp;amp; Hogue CJ (2005).

When it undergoes &lt;strong&gt;antigenic shift&lt;/strong&gt;, as the novel H1N1 ("swine") flu did, it efficiently evades most people's immune systems.  Non-novel flu strains are bad enough, but antigenically novel strains can have a ridiculously high attack rate.  &lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2009/07/flubook.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="flubook.jpg"&gt; John Barry's book, The Great Influenza, is a (usually*) terrific read, and describes very clearly what can happen when a novel influenza virus encounters a naive population. In the case of the 1918 pandemic, the circulating virus had not only a very high attack rate, but was also violently virulent, killing a large percentage of those infected (at least after the first wave).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the new flu has had the attack rate, but not the virulence.  That isn't to say it's the equivalent of the common cold; it's not.  Influenza is a potentially serious disease, so the more people it afflicts, the more (in raw numbers) will become seriously ill or die.  Still, we've been lucky so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But our we lucky or good?  So far, I vote for luck.  Our luck is due mostly to the virus's lack of virulence, not to medical or public health breakthroughs.  The pandemic has not been contained.  Influenza likes crowds, and military bases and summer camps are crowded.  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/us/15flu.html"&gt;The Air Force is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that a large number of cadets at their Academy have H1N1 flu, a number likely to grow larger.  But at least it's a containable environment, right?  Military recruits have to follow orders, after all.  During World War I, containment and control of the epidemic failed at least in part to military orders, or lack of them.  In the frenzy to fight, our military and government allowed soldiers who were ill or at risk to travel the world, leading to events such as the Death Train from Camp Grant in Illinois, which, while en route to another camp in Georgia, spread the flu from town to town, and arrived at its destination with up to ten percent of it's passengers dead or soon to be dead.  But we've learned from our experiences, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[An academy spokesman] said it was nearly impossible to determine the source of the outbreak because some cadets had fanned out across the world for various Air Force-related programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been very lucky so far, in that H1N1 is not more virulent than other influenza viruses.  This luck may or may not continue.  If we continue a "business as usual" approach to containment, we will be lucky if all we have to deal with is some mild suffering and days lost at work.  I don't like to contemplate what will happen if our luck runs out.  But someone had better.&lt;/p&gt;

Scale bar is 10um in #2, for size comparison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trichonympha is this giant and utterly adorable wood-eating gut endosymbiont of early-branching dictyoptera (cockroaches and termites). Sadly, it's anaerobic and thereby difficult to play with unless you have a steady supply of termites going on in your lab, like those guys do. As for the wood roach from which these particular critters come from, it has to be ordered. This roach also has the amazing &lt;a href="http://skepticwonder.blogspot.com/2008/11/sunday-protist-saccinobaculus.html"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Saccinobaculus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;...Trichonympha can also be found in basal termites; we're lucky to have some native ones here in Vancouver (alas, devoid of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Saccinobaculus&lt;/span&gt; =( )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like cockroaches and termites formed endosymbiotic relationships with the protists before the two diverged - both groups have endosymbionts in their basal lineages, and lose them later on. The protistan endosymbiont diversity is wonderful: you have the aforementioned and much beloved 'snake-in-a-bag' (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Saccinobaculus&lt;/span&gt;; can you tell I'm obsessed yet?) and fellow oxymonad companions like &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Streblomastix&lt;/span&gt; - a long cell with 'docking' for even longer episymbiont bacteria on it; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Trichomitopsis&lt;/span&gt; and its protruding axostyle when it curls up into a ball; accompanied by loads of symbiont and parasitic bacteria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wood-eating dictyoptera require endosymbionts to digest cellulose, since we metazoans suck at it. The more derived termites can get by with bacteria it seems; but interestingly the protists are actually doing the digesting themselves in the basal termites - killing off the gut bacteria does not prevent the termite from being able to digest the wood, if I recall correctly from class... (was a while ago since we sliced up some termites and cockroaches). Either way, you end up with this complex society with protists of all sorts with bacterial endo- and episymbionts, as well as free-living forms. I find it amazing how this system survived locked inside the termite/roach guts for millions of years; it would not survive without them!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the protists are anaerobic and lack conventional mitochondria, instead carrying highly reduced relics as mitosomes or hydrogenosomes; the latter produce hydrogen gas as a byproduct of their metabolic pathways. It was once thought those organisms were primarily amitochondriate, thus shoving them to the base of the eukaryotic tree, also known as the&lt;br&gt;Archezoan Hypothesis, put forth by Tom Cavalier-Smith; later this hypothesis was rejected as relics of ancient mitochondrial gene transfers were found in some of the host nuclei and the evidence accumulating for one of the prime archaezoans, microsporidia, being found to branch smack in the middle of fungi (beginnings of demise of Archaezoa discussed in &lt;a href="http://www.botany.ubc.ca/keeling/PDF/98King.pdf"&gt;Keeling 1998 BioEssays&lt;/a&gt;; free access).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's 4am and I should stop procrastinating with my assignment... but here ya go.

&lt;p&gt;But don’t do it &lt;a href="http://www.christianpost.com/blogs/books/2009/07/what-is-atheism-a-note-to-my-atheist-friends-14/"&gt;the way Christian theology professor &lt;strong&gt;Randal Rauser&lt;/strong&gt; does it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some advice to him is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #1) Don’t begin a note to atheists like this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I must say that as a general rule I like the atheists I meet. Oh sure, there is the odd mean fundamentalist atheist out there, just like in every other belief system. But most atheists I talk with are intelligent and thoughtful, if at times overly defensive.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to like Christians I meet, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except the ones who believe in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the rest of them are intelligent and thoughtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(What is a “mean atheist fundamentalist” exactly?  He never explains.  I’d like to know…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #2) Explain the problem at hand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sadly, I have found that atheists often misunderstand both the nature of atheism and of Christianity…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a good start.  Put the blame on the other side.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you do that, don’t imply that Christians know better especially when you yourself misunderstand the nature of atheism (see Tip #3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #3) Don’t you yourself misunderstand the nature of atheism:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The problem here, in short, is that atheists often are not clear either on what atheism is or on what its rational defense requires…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Problems begin when atheists confuse atheism with agnosticism (a confusion which in my experience happens quite often). Atheism is the affirmation of the proposition (1) “there is no God”…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*sigh*  No, that’s completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, Rauser goes against his own definition in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Okay, here is the single definition provided in Merriam-Websters: “one who believes that there is no deity”. And here is the Longman dictionary’s single definition: “the belief that God does not exist.”…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear on this: Atheists &lt;em&gt;don’t believe&lt;/em&gt; a god exists.  That’s very different from claiming that one absolutely, positively doesn’t exist.  I don’t believe in a god for the same reasons I don’t believe in unicorns, Santa Claus, and ugly-looking-Swedish-people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Might they exist?  Maybe.  Do I think they do?  Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #4) Don’t try to converse with atheists and then call them agnostics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Agnosticism is the stance where one affirms neither (1) “there is no God” or its negation, (2) “there is a God”. Agnosticism is a respectable position. One may very well believe there is inadequate evidence either way to settle the question. But I have encountered a number of people who took the agnostic position, and yet persisted in calling themselves atheists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not agnostics.  We are not in the “middle” when it comes to god’s existence.  We’re clearly leaning in one direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I’m not a fan of people who call themselves agnostics.  It’s the more politically correct position, perhaps, since atheist has a stigma attached to it, but it’s weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the popular example goes (work with me here), we can’t say that the Flying Spaghetti Monster exists nor can we say He doesn’t.  Are we agnostic about the FSM?  No.  We’re atheists regarding Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip #5) Stop the attempt at conversation until you can stop digging the hole you’re already in:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good try.  It’s a worthwhile thing to do.  But this is a bad start.  Maybe some other time.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible, I say, for the human mind not to believe that there is, in all this, design, cause and effect, up to an ultimate cause, a fabricator of all things from matter and motion.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I’d love to see that quote in context.)  The authority argument is combined with the same tired old assertions about how natural selection could never have produced the “digital information” represented by the DNA code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery has made acute a longstanding scientific mystery that Darwin never addressed or solved: the mystery of how the very first life on earth arose. To date no theory of undirected chemical evolution has explained the origin of the digital information in DNA needed to build the first living cell on earth. Yet modern scientists who argue for intelligent design do not do so merely because natural processes have failed to explain the origin of the information in cells. Instead, they argue for design because systems possessing these features invariably arise from intelligent causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA functions like a software program. We know that software comes from programmers. Information – whether inscribed in hieroglyphics, written in a book, or encoded in a radio signal – always arises from an intelligent source. So the discovery of digital code in DNA provides a strong scientific reason for concluding that the information in DNA also had an intelligent source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design is an inference from biological data, not a deduction from religious authority. Jefferson said just that, and based his political thinking on it. The evidence for what he presciently called “Nature’s God’’ is stronger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a 6,000-year-old Earth also an “inference from geological data”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This God-of-the-gaps argument for DNA has been addressed by evolutionists many, many times.  See, for example, Dawkins’s most recent books or Ken Miller’s &lt;em&gt;Only a Theory&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing, really, that a paper with the gravitas of the &lt;em&gt;Globe&lt;/em&gt; would publish such a piece of tripe.  First of all, the argument is wrong.  Second, it’s not new.  Surely someone at the Globe must recognize that the &lt;em&gt;appearance&lt;/em&gt; of design does not demonstrate the &lt;em&gt;occurrence&lt;/em&gt; of design.  Then again, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: I stand corrected–Stephen Meyer is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a young earth creationist. I was thinking of his Discovery Institute colleague &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nelson_%28creationist%29"&gt;Paul Nelson&lt;/a&gt;, whom I debated a while back.  My apologies to Mr. Meyer for attributing to him a lunatic idea of his colleague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary data indicates that the RazakSAT, equipped with a high resolution Medium-Sized Aperture Camera (MAC), achieved the intended Near-Equatorial Low Earth Orbit (NEqO) at 685 km altitude and a 9 degree inclination. The payload is expected to provide high resolution images of Malaysia that can be applied to land management, resource development and conservation, forestry and fish migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool! I’m glad to see them doing so well. &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/multimedia/videos.php?id=40&amp;amp;cat=recent"&gt;They have a video of the launch online&lt;/a&gt;, which is absolutely worth a few minutes of your time. My favorite part is how you can see the Kestrel second stage engine nozzle get red hot; it’s designed to cool off radiatively — that is, literally glow with heat — and that is very evident in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SpaceX is supposed to launch their much larger and more capable Falcon 9 later this year, the start of a series of tests to get the rocket ready &lt;a href="http://spacex.com/dragon.php"&gt;to take humans into space&lt;/a&gt;. I’m hoping they can begin doing this around the time the Space Shuttle is retired. NASA screwed up bigtime here, allowing a four to five year gap in their ability to put people in space, and they’ll have to rely on others to do it for them in the meantime.

I would still jump at the chance to go into space. I also recognize that human space exploration may be the height of exciting adventure, but that is about all it is. The best science we will ever do, and the most exciting knowledge we will ever gain, will involve unmanned space vehicles, robotic devices, and a lot less money than the $200 billion we are going to spend getting Americans back on the Moon 50 years after they left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This past year also saw the 40th anniversary of another space event, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/"&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/"&gt;Stanley Kubrick&lt;/a&gt;’s remarkably realistically rendered version of Arthur C. Clarke’s vision of a future in which humans would travel throughout the solar system with abandon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The movie now reminds me of a &lt;a href="http://www.johnprine.net/"&gt;John Prine&lt;/a&gt; song, Living in the Future, where he jokingly argues that by now, based on reading the newspapers 15 years earlier, “We're all driving rocket ships, and talking with our minds.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While no one might have guessed we would leave the moon in 1969 and not return again ‘til perhaps 2020, we should have guessed that the real world in 2001 would not resemble Clarke’s vision. What we have learned in the last 40 years is that human space exploration is inordinately costly and far more dangerous than we were led to believe by the successes of the Apollo program.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, the limitations on human space travel are far more mundane than science fiction on television or in the movies suggests. We are not held back for lack of a warp drive, although real fuel costs are another reason why it is so much cheaper to send unmanned missions into space. Rather, the chief obstacle against human travel to Mars is simply cosmic radiation. During the 18 months or so to do the round trip journey a lethal dose of radiation is likely to be received.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Television and movies have built on our innate human desire to explore the universe by inventing fictitious ways that we can tool around the galaxy. I have no problem with this, especially if it gets people thinking about what might be possible without giving them the misimpression that fiction and reality are the same thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And none of this suggests to me that we shouldn’t go into space. Rather, we should do it realistically; recognizing that if we are to continue doing science we need to separate science from the manned space program, and also not waste huge amounts of money on things like the International Space Station under the guise that anything useful will be learned there outside of how humans can live 200 miles above Earth’s surface for extended periods. And, finally, we should come to grips with the limitations that physics and biology put on human space travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frankly, I have always thought that one of the things that makes human space travel so exciting for people is the possibility that the astronauts may die in the process. It is, in a sense, the ultimate reality show, where the odds are life and death. So maybe there is room for a movie in which the NASA of the future requires astronauts who want to go to Mars to make it a one-way trip, focusing on the wrenching choices they would have to make in order to live out their dreams. That would certainly be less disconnected with reality than the gap between 2001: A Space Odyssey and the space program circa 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/uU4TQ1NTo50%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/1vXdRUIZ_EM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-1335302053479465811?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Luckily, this takes little to no effort because I already wrote about it here for Skepchick Magazine, the monthly e-zine that we produced before focusing entirely on the blog. Last night, I dug up my archived copy of that article and recreated it as a blog post, which &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8177"&gt;you can find here&lt;/a&gt;. All the photos are the same, and the captions are now hover text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this now is pretty amusing for me, since a lot has changed in just a few years. I mention a poker-playing, whiskey-drinking roommate, who you all may know today as Sam Ogden, aka the one and only boy on Skepchick. Fellow Skepchick Evelyn is also mentioned as giving us a tour of Red Rocks. A grand total of four current Skepchick writers appear in the photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why I bring it up now, though, is for two references to someone I met at TAM 4. The first, under the Saturday overview, is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I left, by the way, at around 1 am when the party was still raging. Also, I was wearing UK skeptic Sid Rodrigues’ Chuck Taylors — yet another example of a charitable skeptic, this time helping out a girl with cold feet who couldn’t stand to wear her pink high heels a second longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walked into the darkened lounge. It was after midnight and they were closing down, but in Vegas apparently you can just go wherever you want no matter what. As I walked past the bar to the tables in the back next to the giant glass doors that overlooked the pool, I saw that there was one other person there. Sid, who had so graciously given me his shoes a few nights ago, sat alone smoking a cigarette and enjoying a beer. At this point, as I settled in next to him to just be quiet and stare out the windows, I realized my favorite aspect of TAM. Somehow, wherever you go, you’re not alone. In a vast world that seems so fraught with misinformation and superstition, we collect in this basin of sin and false promises and we make it our own. We overrun the bars and the elevators and the poker tables and pretend for a weekend that we live in a world of logic and intellect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sid and I talked a while, and decided that we should get married next year in Vegas, at TAM 5. He folded me an engagement ring out of a ten dollar bill and told me he didn’t mind if I hocked it the next morning for some breakfast (I was bluffing, I wouldn’t dare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’re interested, you’re all invited to the wedding. I was thinking we’d have Randi perform it, maybe in an Elvis get-up. I haven’t run this past Randi yet, but I think it’s right up his alley. After all, what else are we going to do to top this year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="My now-husband and I" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_1190.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="216"&gt;(And the caption under the photo [at right] was “My sort of fiance and I.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as many of you now know, Sid and I didn’t get married at TAM 5 but we &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8100"&gt;did just get married at TAM 7&lt;/a&gt;, and Randi didn’t perform it but he did witness it. I can’t think of a better way to celebrate our bizarre, improbable love than to surprise the 1,000 attendees of the skeptic conference where we first met. Luckily, the attendees (and those watching the live stream online) seemed to get a huge kick out of it. Also, a lot of people seemed curious as to what actually went down, what work went into it, and whether it was for real. I was going to allow the mystery to persist, but I really wanted to publicly thank those who made this very public event a success. So, here are my thank yous, which should spell out a little of the backstory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3710572411/in/set-72157621301815892/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2565/3710572411_aaa1b92f0f_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Skepchick Team&lt;/strong&gt;. When I mentioned to them last month that Sid and I were thinking of getting hitched, the email-version of “squeeeeeeeeee” was launched. They all made a serious effort to get there, with Tracy flying from London, Amanda from Maine, Jen taking a late-night plane on Friday just to wake up early the next day, and Karen enthusiastically joining in even though she’s one of our newest Skepchicks. A tore her way through red tape to fast-track a license to marry us, Maria got in touch with my mom, Elyse contacted Surly Amy to get special wedding necklaces made, Jill designed and drew gorgeous/hilarious post-wedding invitations to hand out to the crowd, Carrie cooked us all breakfast at the villa. They teamed up to brainstorm new ideas, they worked with my cousin to buy and create bouquets for everyone, they threw me a bachelorette party (with, yes, a stripper), and there was probably a crap-ton of behind-the-scenes stuff I didn’t even see. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3717947114/in/set-72157621399492562/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2627/3717947114_4a6aa2b44a_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;They coordinated their black outfits and red shoes, and even the Skepchicks (and SkepSam) who couldn’t make it helped out where they could. I know that Bug Girl, Sam, Chelsea, and Stacey would have been there if they could have. They all made me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. Also: let’s include the official Skepchick husbands, Tim and Christian, who were in the villa all weekend and were massively helpful at driving places (like to get marriage licenses) and keeping Sid entertained while I was subjected to a stripper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surly Amy&lt;/strong&gt;, official jeweler of Skepchick. I met her for the first time at TAM7, and she was every bit as dynamic and smart as I suspected. Her husband Johnny was equally rad. I’ll stop there, because I’ll be writing more about Amy in another post . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3707319853/in/set-72157621239858734/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3707319853_65d1be7fc9_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The SGU&lt;/strong&gt;, my fellow podcasters. Steve, Evan, Jay, and Bob were so up for anything it took to make the wedding as fun as possible. We first batted around the idea of having it take place during the Q&amp;amp;A while we recorded a show last month, and I was blown away by how happy they were to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The JREF staff&lt;/strong&gt;, who not only pulled off a nearly flawless conference (from an audience’s and speaker’s perspective), but also went above and beyond to accommodate our ridiculous plan. My long-time friend Phil Plait was in on the wedding plans from the start and was so helpful. Bart Farkas put up with tons of lip from me, Sean McCabe is just about the smoothest mofo out there, Jeff Wagg and Rich Montalvo let us stream the show live on Saturday AND archived it so that people could watch later for free, Karl and Linda Shallenberger were a joy to see even when they were running around doing a thousand things at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3717917458/in/set-72157621399492562/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2556/3717917458_463f51e445_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;George Hrab&lt;/strong&gt;, who I asked to participate in vague terms since at the start I had no idea how all this would go. He enthusiastically agreed and made spot-on suggestions for music he might play and what might be the funniest way for him to appear on stage. He played one of my favorite songs for our first dance (the Beach Boys’ &lt;em&gt;God Only Knows&lt;/em&gt;) and then convinced nearly the entire TAM audience to get up and dance along, before 9am. Seriously. He is talented and charming and lovely in every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3710269617/in/set-72157621296954626/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2584/3710269617_4647668703_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;TV’s Adam Savage&lt;/strong&gt;, who I ran into the day prior and spontaneously asked if he’d like to be in the wedding. He didn’t even hesitate. “But it’s going to be really early. Like, 8am.” “I’ll be there!” Not only did he show up and play his part beautifully, but he hung out afterward, taking photos with everyone and even signing an autograph for my cousin’s daughter. I’ve rarely met anyone so awesome and yet so down-to-earth and completely full of joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3710260509/in/set-72157621296954626/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2456/3710260509_ba248c82d3_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hal Bidlack&lt;/strong&gt;, who emceed the conference and ran the Q&amp;amp;A sessions for the SGU shows, which means that he was in on everything. He was uncharacteristically funny (just kidding), sweet, and supportive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maggie McFee&lt;/strong&gt;, who became our go-to wedding photographer. She’s so talented, as you can see by browsing her Flickr sets &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/sets/72157621296954626/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/sets/72157621301815892/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/sets/72157621399492562/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and without her we’d have no perfectly-composed pictures of nearly naked people at the Skepchick party/wedding reception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tony Monje&lt;/strong&gt;, owner of Ultimate Cupcakes in Texas. Tony didn’t know about the wedding but sent cupcakes to Vegas anyway, just because he’s awesome. We got them Friday night and shared them during the Skepchick party/reception Saturday night, adding to my mom’s cakes to equal the appropriate amount of wedding reception cake. And the reviews were totally positive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3724364108/"&gt;&lt;img title="My brother" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3418/3724364108_8670dc7cee_m.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;My family.&lt;/strong&gt; Not only did my parents, brothers, sister-in-law, and cousins all fly out to Vegas on short notice, but they made the whole wedding so much cooler. My mom made a tiered wedding cake, among other things, and my cousin Pam was some kind of wedding-prep machine. All of them got along wonderfully with my friends and managed to roll with the punches on an incredibly bizarre trip. I love them, and the event was a thousand times better with them there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3710576067/in/set-72157621301815892/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2585/3710576067_08f9324ced_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;James Randi&lt;/strong&gt;, who both Sid and I love and admire, and who we’re proud to call a friend. Obviously, if it weren’t for Randi, Sid and I never would have met and the world would be a darker place (for other reasons, as well). Randi’s energy and commitment are inspiring, and I hope to one day raise a glass with him at our 10th anniversary (at TAM 17?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tankgrrl/3708140746/in/set-72157621239858734/"&gt;&lt;img title="Photo by Maggie McFee" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2533/3708140746_9dfc466414_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;. Sid delivered a toast at the Skepchick party/reception Saturday night in which he mentioned how wonderful it was to celebrate with so many people who feel like a second family to us. There were the people we already knew, like Josh and Blake who flew out from Boston. There were all our friends from TAMs past like Kristoff, Kitty, Chip, Glenn and Lola, the Hursts, Scott Romanowski, Twylla, Simon, Paul A, the Marquis, Winslow, Mike Feldman, Tim Farley, DC, Scrut, Jonas and Mary Alice, at least three Matts, Evelyn, Jackie, Aaron, Sarah, and so many more, too many to list here and too many to even have had much time with—but just seeing them all and getting hugs was enough. And there were the people we had only just met, some of whom actually got us wedding presents, and tons of whom gave us hugs, well wishes, words of wisdom, and an incredibly satisfying feeling that if just one casino in the whole world was so full of sweet, kind people, then maybe humanity has a chance after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/192749618/"&gt;&lt;img title="Sid &amp;amp; I in London" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/75/192749618_71aa659b26_m.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“Everyone” also includes all of you who didn’t make it, but who watched online or saw the pics or just heard it through the grapevine and sent us kind messages via email, Twitter, Facebook, smoke signals, telegraph, or psychic communication. And especially my friends Liz, Lauren, and Jared, who were watching at my apartment with Captain Infinity. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My husband&lt;/strong&gt;. Oh, right, I should really thank him as well. He makes my heart pound, he makes me laugh, he makes me lasagna, and he makes me a better person. I love him and I can’t wait to finally live on the same continent as him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247680168672"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13826">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/722512ce1a05e809</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Texas “Experts” Suggest Pro-Christian History Curriculum</title><published>2009-07-15T17:12:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T17:12:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/15/texas-experts-suggest-pro-christian-history-curriculum/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We already know conservative Christians are attacking Science curriculums across the country.  Now &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124753078523935615.html"&gt;they’re trying to revise History classes&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh.  It’s Texas.  I get it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the three &lt;a href="http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/teks/social/experts.html"&gt;reviewers&lt;/a&gt; proposing pro-Christian revisionist history are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Barton, founder of WallBuilders, a group that promotes America’s Christian heritage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rev. Peter Marshall, who preaches that Watergate, the Vietnam War and Hurricane Katrina were God’s judgments on the nation’s sexual immorality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In early recommendations from outside experts appointed by the board, a divide has opened over how central religious theology should be to the teaching of history…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three reviewers, appointed by social conservatives, have recommended revamping the K-12 curriculum to emphasize the roles of the Bible, the Christian faith and the civic virtue of religion in the study of American history. &lt;/strong&gt;Two of them want to remove or de-emphasize references to several historical figures who have become liberal icons, such as César Chávez and Thurgood Marshall.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;De-emphasize&lt;/em&gt; Thurgood Marshall?  The first African-American appointed to the Supreme Court?  The person who argued for the winning side in &lt;em&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/em&gt;?  A person who presided over some of the most important civil rights cases in U.S. history?  We don’t do him enough justice in our schools as is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing how these people want to praise &lt;strong&gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christians also want to include &lt;strong&gt;Billy Graham&lt;/strong&gt; on the list of “transformational leaders of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How should social studies teachers explain the system of checks and balances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The conservative reviewers say… the separation of powers set forth in the Constitution stems from a scriptural understanding of man’s fall and inherent sinfulness, or “radical depravity,” which means he can be governed only by an intricate system of checks and balances.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, there’s my favorite change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Replace references to America’s “democratic” values with “republican” values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviewer David Barton suggests swapping out “republican” for “democratic” in teaching materials. As he explains: “We don’t pledge allegiance to the flag and the democracy for which it stands.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why does all this matter when each state has its own standards?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas is such a large market that textbook-makers would cater their books to adapt to Texas’ (soon-to-be-lower?) standards, books which can also then be used in other states.  Not only that, some publishers “[adopt] the majority’s editing suggestions nearly verbatim.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not an isolated incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this has been adopted yet, of course.  It’s just a possibility.  But so was unnecessary criticism of evolution at one time… now, that criticism is part of Texas’ new science standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois just made some &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/07/some-social-service-agencies-in.html"&gt;pretty severe cuts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, he [Dale Morrissey CEO of &lt;a href="http://www.dsc-illinois.org/"&gt;Developmental Services Center&lt;/a&gt;] added, in three decades on the job he's never seen a state budget mess have this severe an effect on social-service funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've never seen it this bad and I've never seen it go this far," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs and programs being cut by one or the other of the two local agencies allow parents of developmentally disabled clients to leave their homes and earn a living. They keep people with disabilities in homes and employed. They help the homeless and keep those with mental health issues out of emergency rooms and police squad cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here's the thing--without the services, a number of people are no longer able to work or avoid crisis situations.  Because they are no longer working, they are no longer paying taxes.  Because they are no longer paying taxes, they are no longer contributing to the funding that would provide them with the services to enable them work, and pay taxes, and support themselves.  Without the services, people are more likely to enter crisis situations and use significantly more costly services such as emergency housing assistance and hospital emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we end up with people who have no jobs, people who are in costly crisis situations, and because of these two things even less chance of economic recovery (not to mention anything resembling quality of life).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to say anything conclusive of the financial and health and safety impact a real analysis would have to be undertaken, but the potential for a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle"&gt;vicious cycle&lt;/a&gt; that quickly becomes very hard to break is pretty clear.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has such an analysis happened?  Or are these types of decisions merely panic reactions?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247677890387"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3888298588879086159">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6997d7a83ebdd7f1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Andrew Coyne on Conservative Values</title><published>2009-07-15T16:48:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T17:00:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/andrew-coyne-on-conservative-values.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3888298588879086159/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3888298588879086159" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html">We don&amp;#39;t really have a (small &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;) conservative party in Canada.

The public perception of a skeptic, I think it’s fair to say, is of a cold person who tries to deny their emotions, a party-pooper whose existence is simply to rain on everyone else’s parade, someone who categorizes everything into tightly constrained boxes with rigid definitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of over 1000 people who attended TAM 7 last week who might disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can think of two in particular: my friends and colleagues Rebecca Watson and Sid Rodrigues, who got married right there at TAM! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had planned this out in advance, and set it up carefully. Rebecca is one of &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;the Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; podcasters, and they record a show live in front of the TAM audience every year before the regular TAM session starts. This year, during the Q&amp;amp;A part, Sid stood up… and, well, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yi2KTaieDs"&gt;watch for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/_Yi2KTaieDs%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awe. Some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFZgNKZN1Qs"&gt;the JREF released footage of the wedding&lt;/a&gt; as well, taken from a different angle.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3721465941/in/set-72157621344864649"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/3721465941_1bf6684380_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to people’s reactions in the video, too. Note the laughter, the smiles, the surprise, the support, the love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, skeptics are a cold bunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note how giving of their time they are. There might even be an appearance of My Close Personal Friend™ during the wedding, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on this, including a video taken from another angle, check out &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8100"&gt;Bug Girl’s skepchick post&lt;/a&gt;. I imagine more video will be popping up soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sincere and whole-hearted congrats to the happy couple. It was a perfect wedding: funny, warm, silly, and the two betrothed surrounded by friends and family… with the line between the two very much blurred. Sometimes, that’s just the way we skeptics like it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247676338210"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14219">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40b2fe72c681767f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="family"/><category term="prison"/><title type="html">Sentencing Discounts for Parents?

It has been true for quite some time (many tens of millions of years) that terrestrial plants do not move around while animal herbivores do (though I've got friends from Texas who claim that there is a Texan tree that will move from one side of your yard to the other if it is pleased to do so).  Generally speaking, a plant can not avoid being consumed by the herbivores by running away.  So, it must have a defensive strategy or two that work in situ, and most likely these strategies evolved in relation to the also-evolving strategies of the mobile herbivores.  The complex interconnected dynamics of herbivore-plant co-evolution provides much of the fabric for the ecology of any given terrestrial biome. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_poison_in_the_leaf_macro_e_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_poison_in_the_leaf_macro_e_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/4Ix9B94LYGA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247675625417"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/qdragon_pwns_discovery_institu.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4fea84a481cb349</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Qdragon pwns Discovery Institute</title><published>2009-07-15T16:12:35Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T16:12:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/pWrD4lslN5s/qdragon_pwns_discovery_institu.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/qdragon_pwns_discovery_institu.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Y-K_VY6VZZw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=560&amp;amp;height=340" width="560" height="340"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Lars and I spent a lot of time together at the Lindau Nobel meeting where Lars interviewed me and I asked Lars to provide a guest-post for my blog about the main 'take-home' message he got from the conference:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Feynman was 29 when he finally published his works on quantum electrodynamics. At the age of 22, Charles Darwin first set foot on the Beagle, and Gerhard Ertl started his groundbreaking works on surface catalysis when he was a PhD student. The Nobel laureates I met in Lindau may have been somewhat elderly, but they never hesitated to make clear that age and experience are no prerequisites to great discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite the contrary. One of the main messages that nearly all laureates emphasized in their lectures and discussions was that the real source of innovation in science are young academics. Martin Chalfie, for example, talked at length about the role his PhD students and postdocs played in alerting him to the possibilities of Green Fluorescent Proteins, which eventually earned him a Nobel prize. It was, however, Sir Harold Kroto who said it best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Theory of Relativity wasn't invented &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Albert_Einstein_Head.jpg" title=""&gt;by him&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Einstein old.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Einstein%20old.jpg" width="336" height="438" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein_patentoffice.jpg" title=""&gt;by him&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Einstein young.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Einstein%20young.jpg" width="336" height="439" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobel prizes are rarely ever the result of meticulous planning, but usually result from spontaneous ideas, new perspectives and novel approaches. Most came out of left field. That's why Richard Ernst recommended that researchers should develop an interest outside of science - to develop new perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young academics should have the right to fail now and then and develop the courage to risk failure in their research. Trail-blazing research doesn't happen by playing it safe. Research, says Aaron Ciechanover, is full of risk, as is life. A message that especially funding agencies should take to heart. Also, authority isn't always right. Sometimes his/her own curiosity leads a researcher to places where established scientists don't see anything worthwhile. Following such unlikely leads may pay off, according to Gerhard Ertl. It's well worth remembering that young Max Planck was - in what turned out to be the biggest misjudgment in the history of science - once told that there was nothing left to discover in physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In practice, science is only limited by the imaginary power of mankind", says Ryoji Noyori. "I am really losing the power of imagination, because of my age. However, our young successors are full of curiosity, passion and persistence." The most interesting people in Lindau really weren't the Nobel laureates, but the young academics that listened intently to their lectures. They will cause scientific revolutions undreamed of, and their achievements will determine how - and if - we all will live in the future. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/nobel_laureates_on_being_young.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Wq2offyKF88" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247673790131"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/15/what-questions-can-science-answer/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/274b7d35d853773b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Philosophy"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">What Questions Can Science Answer?</title><published>2009-07-15T15:01:05Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T15:01:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/07/15/what-questions-can-science-answer/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One frustrating aspect of our &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/06/23/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible/"&gt;discussion about the compatibility of science and religion&lt;/a&gt; was the amount of effort expended arguing about definitions, rather than substance.  When I use words like “God” or “religion,” I try to use them in senses that are consistent with how they have been understood (at least in the Western world) through history, by the large majority of contemporary believers, and according to definitions as you would encounter them in a dictionary.  It seems clear to me that, by those standards, religious belief typically involves various claims about &lt;em&gt;things that happen in the world&lt;/em&gt; — for example, the virgin birth or ultimate resurrection of Jesus.  Those claims can be judged by science, and are found wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people would prefer to define “religion” so that religious beliefs entail nothing whatsoever about what happens in the world.  And that’s fine; definitions are not correct or incorrect, they are simply useful or useless, where usefulness is judged by the clarity of one’s attempts at communication.  Personally, I think using “religion” in that way is not very clear.  Most Christians would disagree with the claim that Jesus came about because Joseph and Mary had sex and his sperm fertilized her ovum and things proceeded conventionally from there, or that Jesus didn’t really rise from the dead, or that God did not create the universe.  The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_for_the_Causes_of_Saints"&gt;Congregation for the Causes of Saints&lt;/a&gt;, whose job it is to judge whether a candidate for canonization has really performed the required number of miracles and so forth, would probably not agree that miracles don’t occur.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Collins_%28geneticist%29"&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/a&gt;, recently nominated to direct the NIH, argues that some sort of God hypothesis helps explain the values of the fundamental constants of nature, just like a good Grand Unified Theory would.  These views are by no means outliers, even without delving into the more extreme varieties of Biblical literalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if a religious person really did believe that nothing ever happened in the world that couldn’t be perfectly well explained by ordinary non-religious means, I would think they would expend their argument-energy engaging with the many millions of people who believe that the virgin birth and the resurrection and the promise of an eternal afterlife and the efficacy of intercessory prayer are all actually literally true, rather than with a handful of atheist bloggers with whom they agree about everything that happens in the world.  But it’s a free country, and people are welcome to define words as they like, and argue with whom they wish.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was also a more interesting and substantive issue lurking below the surface.  I focused in that post on the meaning of “religion,” but did allude to the fact that defenders of Non-Overlapping Magisteria often misrepresent “science” as well.  And this, I think, is not just a matter of definitions:  we can more or less agree on what “science” means, and still disagree on what questions it has the power to answer.  So that’s an issue worth examining more carefully:  what does science actually have the power to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of one popular but very bad strategy for answering this question:  first, attempt to distill the essence of “science” down to some punchy motto, and then ask what questions fall under the purview of that motto.  At various points throughout history, popular mottos of choice might have been “the Baconian scientific method” or “logical positivism” or “Popperian falsificationism” or “methodological naturalism.”  But this tactic always leads to trouble.  Science is a messy human endeavor, notoriously hard to boil down to cut-and-dried procedures.  A much better strategy, I think, is to consider specific examples, figure out what kinds of questions science can reasonably address, and compare those to the questions in which we’re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my favorite example question.  Alpha Centauri A is a G-type star a little over four light years away.  Now pick some very particular moment one billion years ago, and zoom in to the precise center of the star.  Protons and electrons are colliding with each other all the time.  Consider the collision of two electrons nearest to that exact time and that precise point in space.  Now let’s ask:  was momentum conserved in that collision?  Or, to make it slightly more empirical, was the magnitude of the total momentum after the collision within one percent of the magnitude of the total momentum before the collision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t supposed to be a trick question; I don’t have any special knowledge or theories about the interior of Alpha Centauri that you don’t have.  The scientific answer to this question is:  of course, the momentum was conserved.  Conservation of momentum is a principle of science that has been tested to very high accuracy by all sorts of experiments, we have every reason to believe it held true in that particular collision, and absolutely no reason to doubt it; therefore, it’s perfectly reasonable to say that momentum was conserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stickler might argue, well, you shouldn’t be so sure.  You didn’t observe &lt;em&gt;that particular&lt;/em&gt; event, after all, and more importantly there’s no conceivable way that you could collect data at the present time that would answer the question one way or the other.  Science is an empirical endeavor, and should remain silent about things for which no empirical adjudication is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

This is the fourth and final post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. &lt;strong&gt;Bigotry&lt;/strong&gt;. At the end of his review, Myers says something astonishing. He claims that our “bigotry blinds [us] to a range of approaches offered by the ‘New Atheists’…a group that is not so closed to the wide range of necessarily differing tactics that such a deep problem requires as Mooney and Kirshenbaum are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a baseless accusation. Chris is an atheist, and he is not bigoted against himself, his mother (an outspoken secular humanist), or any other atheists. Sheril is Jewish an agnostic, and not bigoted against Chris or any other atheists, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myers provides no evidence of our supposed biogtry. He just makes an inflammatory accusation, one not at all conducive to rational or calm discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is precisely this kind of rhetoric that led us to address Myers so directly in &lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;The Trouble With PZ Myers. &lt;/strong&gt;In his review, Myers doesn’t address our criticisms of him–of his public writings and actions. But we will end by elaborating upon why, in the wake of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php"&gt;communion wafer desecration&lt;/a&gt;, we decided we had to speak out about Myers in a way that would really be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we have not said so until now, Myers is among the central reasons we left ScienceBlogs. There were many factors involved, of course, but one was our shock at what he calls “Crackergate.” We describe the full incident &lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/"&gt;in the book&lt;/a&gt;, but let us quote from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php#comment-1010788"&gt;Myers’ words&lt;/a&gt; when he closed off comments (there had been over 2,000) after posting his picture of the defiled eucharist with a rusty nail driven through it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What effort I put into [the desecration] was not in response to the reality of your silly deity, but in response to the reality of your dangerous delusions. Those are real, all right, and they need to be belittled and weakened. But don’t confuse the fact that I find &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; and your church petty, foolish, twisted, and hateful to be a testimonial to the existence of your petty, foolish, twisted, hateful god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m afraid I’m going to have to close this thread. Its purpose has been well served: the fanatical Catholics and their crazy beliefs have been fully exposed. Over 2300 comments on this subject in 20 hours is quite enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching all of this, we were appalled. We could not see what this act could possibly have to do with promoting science and reason. It contributed nothing to the public understanding or appreciation of science, and everything to a nasty, ugly culture war that hurts and divides us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize that Myers writes entertainingly and sometimes hilariously; we know he’s kind and soft-spoken in person; and we realize he describes science accurately and insightfully. And we understand he’s a very good teacher as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in his online persona–and nowhere more than with the wafer desecration–we believe he cultivates a climate of extremism, incivility and, indeed, unreason (the opposite of calm and respectful debate and exchange) at ScienceBlogs. And it is past time that someone spoke out about that, as we did in &lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/"&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For too long, people in the science blogosphere have tiptoed around Myers. After all, he can send a lot of angry commenters your way. And he, and they, are unrelenting in their criticisms, their attacks, and so on. Just read our threads over the last week–it’s all there, the vast majority from people who have not read our book and do not seem inclined to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re not afraid of Myers or his commenters. They can leave hundreds of posts on our blog–we readily allow it–but our book will be read by a different and far more open-minded audience. It’s already happening. And that audience will largely agree that Myers’ communion wafer desecration was offensive and counterproductive, and that more generally, he epitomizes the current problems with the communication of science on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know how many others agree with us, because we have heard from them. We also know the standards of intellectual decency, fairness, and so on that we’ve learned from years of journalism and in academia. And if, as our book proposes, we are going to be training young science communicators, they must learn at least two basic lessons they will not be getting from Myers: &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;civility&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;tolerance&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our core concern, though, isn’t really about Myers or his blog. What worries us is what they say about the world of American science as it appears on the Internet. For Myers is, as we all know, the most popular blogger on the most popular science blogging site–and has a horde of loyal followers who see themselves as the disciples of reason, and swear by “science” (when they’re not just swearing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is his most famous performance: Desecrating a communion wafer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t just say something unflattering about Myers–it says something devastating about all of us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>the intersection</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247673265760"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1579">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02aefa9c3b64c711</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">American English pronunciation of Uyghur proper nouns</title><published>2009-07-15T15:34:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T15:34:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1579" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V1a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="48484"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V1b.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="41796"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V1c.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="40125"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V2a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="48066"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V2b.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="94877"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V2c.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="89026"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V3a.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="40960"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Uyghur/V3b.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="41796"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The discussion following my original post ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1576"&gt;A Little Primer of Xinjiang Proper Nouns&lt;/a&gt;", 7/13/2009) has proven quite edifying, at  least to me.  One thing that I realized from the lively comments   is that I forgot to give an indication of how the name Xinjiang itself  should be pronounced.  There's also the question of what sort of  "pronouncers" or "respellings" to provide for speakers of American  English who need to pronounce these names but cannot be expected to  render them exactly the way a native speaker of Uyghur would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must preface the following remarks by stating that I'm probably not  the best person to offer standard American English readings of these  names because I'm a fluent speaker of Mandarin and know a bit of  Uyghur. Consequently, when I want to say these words as an American  would, I'm afraid that my Mandarin and my Uyghur get in the way. Still,  I will make an honest effort to separate the three modes and offer  useful guides for speakers of American English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xin1jiang1 新疆 The Uyghur pronunciation of this Mandarin term is  Shinjang شىنجاڭ.   I think that it's all right for an American simply to  say the name Xinjiang about the way the Uyghurs do: SHIN-jahng (I put  the "h" in there to lengthen the "a"). Being acculturated to Mandarin,  I find it hard to avoid saying something like SHIN-jeeahng, even when I'm trying  to speak as an American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recordings of &lt;em&gt;Xinjiang&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mandarin    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. American English&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. unmodified &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. modified &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sinkiang", the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Postal_Map_Romanization"&gt;Postal Map Romanization&lt;/a&gt; of the name, represents a time / place / dialect (Shanghai, 1906)  before the palatalization of the velars (compare Peking and Beijing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how the Uyghurs themselves refer to Xinjiang (Eastern Central  Asia to me), depending upon what part of it they come from or the  circumstances in which they are speaking, they will call it variously  Uyghur Eli (country of the Uyghurs), Uyghur Diyari (Uyghur land),  Uyghur Rayoni (Uyghur Region), Sherki Türkistan (Eastern Türkistan), or  Uyghuristan, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;We've gone over the variant spellings of Uyghur in my earlier post, so now we have  to confront the diverse pronunciations that have been applied to this  name. First of all, I don't see how anyone can get "weewer" out of what  the Uyghur speaker twice says very clearly in the recording. Due to  severe tinnitus, my ears are very bad, but I can distinctly hear a  guttural "gh" sound at the beginning of the second syllable. Now, it is  very difficult for an American to pronounce this sound the way the  Uyghurs do, and I don't think it's necessary for someone speaking  English to attempt it. On the other hand, we needn't resort to  something like "wigger" either. I think wee-GOOR / WEE-goor and WEE-gur  are both fine for American English. Most people I know do say WEE-gur,  as the NYT had it, and that seems quite natural, although wee-GOOR /  WEE-goor more nearly approximates the Turkic sounds. Now, when I'm in  the presence of Turkic speakers, even in America, I usually aspirate the 'g', so it would be something like wee-GHOOR /  WEE-ghoor or WEE-ghur, even though I know that's a pretty pathetic  approximation of the sound the Uyghurs make at the beginning of the  second syllable.
&lt;p&gt;American English pronunciations of &lt;em&gt;Uyghur&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. unmodified:   or &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. modified: &lt;br&gt;
Finally, the name of the capital of the region, Urumchi (and numerous  other spellings), has a broadly accepted pronunciation in English as  oo-ROOM-chee. Again, when I'm in the presence of cognoscenti, I'll put  umlauts on the "u's".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;American English pronunciations of &lt;em&gt;Urumchi&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;p&gt;a. unmodified:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. modified:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, for the standard American renderings of these three names, I  recommend the unmodified pronunciations: SHIN-jahng, WEE-gur or  WEE-goor / wee-GOOR (emphasis on the first syllable is preferred), and  oo-ROOM-chee.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247672221079"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6ea6e676716071e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Shifty Powers</title><published>2011-03-10T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2011-03-10T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/shiftypowers.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Message commemorates the passing of Darrell "Shifty" Powers (of Band of Brothers fame).</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247670444115"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14889">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa57bd8ab10d562d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="recycling"/><category term="Technology"/><title type="html">Cash for Cells</title><published>2009-07-15T14:45:36Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T14:45:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/EGPgzMgdA5g/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/cash-for-cells/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Raise your hand if you have a drawer filled with old cell phones just waiting to be responsibly recycled.

That 1962 news conference is  widely known as the "You won't have Nixon to kick around any more" speech, and I referred to it that way. But I also linked to an &lt;a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/mp3clips/politicalspeeches/richardnixonconcession3242343432.mp3"&gt;mp3 file of the speech&lt;/a&gt;, and in a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1574#comments"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt;, Tim pointed out that Nixon actually says "You don't have Nixon to kick around any more".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;On the web, Google has &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22you+won%27t+have+Nixon+to+kick+around+anymore%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;won't&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ahead of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q="&gt;don't&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 915 to 393 — Bing scores it &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=%22you+won%27t+have+Nixon+to+kick+around+any+more%22&amp;amp;go=&amp;amp;form=QBLH&amp;amp;qs=n"&gt;297&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q="&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;. (Either way, Arnold Zwicky's 7/27/2007 LL post on "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004762.html"&gt;Illeism and its relatives&lt;/a&gt;" is one of those that get it right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the only mistake in the New York Times' version  ("&lt;a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C17F93454157B93CAA9178AD95F468685F9&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;sq=Nixon+news+conference+transcript&amp;amp;st=p"&gt;Transcript of Nixon's News Conference on His Defeat by Brown in Race for Governor&lt;/a&gt;", NYT, 11/8/1962, p. 18), which describes itself as "the transcript of Richard M. Nixon's news conference yesterday in Los Angeles, as recorded by The New York Times through th efacilities of the A.B.C. radio network". Aside from normal editing, there's another interesting mistake in the same passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio, and my transcription:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Last point.&lt;br&gt;
I leave you gentlemen now&lt;br&gt;
and uh  you will now write it, you will interpret it, that's your right.&lt;br&gt;
but as I leave you&lt;br&gt;
uh I want you to know&lt;br&gt;
just think how much you're going to be missing&lt;br&gt;
you don't have Nixon to kick around any more&lt;br&gt;
because gentlemen  this is my last press conference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT transcription &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NixonConcessionLastPoint0.png"&gt;(image of passage as printed)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The last play. I leave you gentlemen now and you will now write it. You will interpret it. That's your right. But as I leave you I want you to know- just think how much you're going to be missing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;You won't have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Let me note again, in passing, President Nixon&amp;#39;s tendency to end phrases on a rising pitch. More on this in a later post…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two omitted uh's are normal editing, and the choices about punctuation and paragraphing are reasonable ones.  But turning "The last point" into "the last play" is a more interesting and meaningful emendation. &lt;em&gt;Play&lt;/em&gt; is more dramatic than &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt;, and it might have been a better choice for Nixon to make, especially because it follows three other passages that he similarly introduces as "One last thing":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NixonLastThings.png"&gt;&lt;img title="Click to embiggen" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NixonLastThings.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a man who was finding it hard to leave the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's another, larger, difference between the archival audio and the NYT transcript, one that I find much harder to understand. Here's how the NYT starts out (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NixonConcessionStart.png"&gt;click for image of passage as printed&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Good morning, gentlemen. Now that Mr. Klein has made his statement, and now that all the members of the press are so delighted that I have lost, I'd like to make a statement of my own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I appreciate the press coverage in this campaign. I think each of you covered it the way you saw it. You had to write it in the way according to your belief on how it would go. I don't believe publishers should tell reporters to write one way or another. I want them all to be free. I don't believe the F.C.C. [Federal Communications Commission] or anybody else should silence [word lost in transmission].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I have no complaints about the press coverage. I think each of you was writing it as you believed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I congratulate Governor Brown, as Herb Klein has already indicated, for his victory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare the audio and my transcript, from the beginning of &lt;a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/mp3clips/politicalspeeches/richardnixonconcession3242343432.mp3"&gt;the mp3 version at American Rhetoric:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I have no complaints about the press coverage&lt;br&gt;
I will never complain about it&lt;br&gt;
I think that each of you were- was writing it as you believed it&lt;br&gt;
and uh I want that always to be the case in America.&lt;br&gt;
Now.&lt;br&gt;
The other thing I want to say is this. I-&lt;br&gt;
I congratulate Governor Brown,&lt;br&gt;
as uh Herb Klein has already indicated, for his victory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[There are those final rises again…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a side-by-side comparison:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the press coverage in this campaign. I think each of you covered it the way you saw it. You had to write it in the way according to your belief on how it would go. I don't believe publishers should tell reporters to write one way or another. I want them all to be free. I don't believe the F.C.C. [Federal Communications Commission] or anybody else should silence [word lost in transmission].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Before start of audio recording?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I have no complaints about the press coverage.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I have no complaints about the press coverage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Missing from NYT transcript?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I will never complain about it&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think each of you was writing it as you believed it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I think that each of you were- was writing it as you believed it&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Missing from NYT transcript?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;and uh I want that always to be the case in America.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Missing from NYT transcript?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Now.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Missing from NYT transcript?]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The other thing I want to say is this.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I congratulate Governor Brown, as Herb Klein has already indicated, for his victory.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I congratulate Governor Brown, as uh Herb Klein has already indicated, for his victory;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the phrase &amp;quot;I have no complaints about the press coverage&amp;quot;, a passage is apparently missing from the audio recording — this is too bad, but it&amp;#39;s a plausible thing to happen. But of the next seven breath-groups in the recording, numbers one, three, and seven are rendered more-or-less normally in the NYT transcript, while two, four, five, and six are entirely missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the stenographer drop her pencil? Has the recording at American Rhetoric been edited to interpolate passages from another speech? I'm genuinely puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the strangeness at the start,  the quality of this 1962 transcript  is better than what I'm used to seeing in the newspapers recently. And nothing very  important depends on the details of this case. But perhaps someone familiar with the methods used to create transcripts in the news business, a half a century ago, can suggest a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[One last thing :-)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Nixon closes with a pathetic plea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;unlike some people&lt;br&gt;
I have never cancelled a subscription to a paper&lt;br&gt;
and also&lt;br&gt;
I never will&lt;br&gt;
I believe in reading&lt;br&gt;
what my opponents say&lt;br&gt;
and I hope that&lt;br&gt;
what I have said today&lt;br&gt;
will at least&lt;br&gt;
make television, radio, the press&lt;br&gt;
first&lt;br&gt;
recognize the great responsibility they have&lt;br&gt;
to report all the news&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and second&lt;br&gt;
recognize&lt;br&gt;
that they have a right and a responsibility if they're against a candidate&lt;br&gt;
to give him the shaft&lt;br&gt;
but also recognize if they give him the shaft&lt;br&gt;
to put one lonely reporter on the campaign&lt;br&gt;
who will report what the candidate says now and then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here, 47 years later, is my &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/NixonConcession.txt"&gt;transcript of his news conference&lt;/a&gt; — or at least the only part of it for which I could find a recording.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;People seem to have started contributing actively to the blog again so I thought it was my turn to try again. And this is an achievement, as facing any science, in particular anything written by me about it, would have been impossible a month ago.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I decided to keep things simple for this one and just give a short introduction on the theme of non-B DNA structures and how they influence disease, the topic of my open essay.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;When we think about DNA, we think about its B-DNA structure, the one that Watson and Crick described in that famous Nature paper more than 50 years ago, i.e. a right-handed double helix, 20Å diameter, in which the base pairs are almost perpendicular to the axis of the helix, 10.5bps per turn. Although most DNA will be in this structure, it can also form other structures, the so called non-B DNA structures. Some of these are shown in the figure. These alternative structures have a few common characteristics: firstly, whether or not a structure is formed, and which specific structure, seems to be sequence dependent, as it often involves formation of new pairings of bases. Secondly, most of these structures are in higher energetic state than normal B-DNA, for example, because they require the separation and reformation of hydrogen bonds. Overall, therefore, DNA with a favourable sequence tends to remain in its B-DNA form, requiring events such as DNA replication, transcription or protein binding to be transiently converted to these unusual structures. Sequences with propensity to form unusual structures are quite common in the human genome, and it seems that in some cases they are necessary for the normal functioning of the cell. However, they have also been implicated in disease, and this is what I’ll be focusing till the end of this post.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_CeUPv27y3nk/Sl3QaJ3gs9I/AAAAAAAAADo/jqn_2YQ2gZw/s1600-h/non-B+DNA+structures.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:283px;height:320px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_CeUPv27y3nk/Sl3QaJ3gs9I/AAAAAAAAADo/jqn_2YQ2gZw/s320/non-B+DNA+structures.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:justify"&gt;There is a considerable list of diseases thought to involve, as part of their pathology, the formation of non-B DNA structures, but the mechanisms by which this is though to happen can vary. For example, certain sequences/structures have been thought to cause genomic instability, e.g. by causing chromosomal rearrangements due to the propensity of these structures to promote double strand breaks. Another interesting form of genomic instability associated with these unusual structures is repeat expansion, implicated in motor diseases such as Huntington’s disease. Non-B DNA structures, namely Z-DNA, have also been associated with viral infections.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Now, there isn’t really enough space here to talk about everything, so I’m going to give one examples of a situation in which a non-B DNA structure is though to be involved in disease. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a disease caused by the expansion of GAA•TTC tracts in intron 1 of a gene encoding the protein frataxin, essential for mitochondrial function. In this disease, repeat expansion is associated with loss of protein expression.  One of the current models by which frataxin production is thought to be reduced in expanded GAA•TTC repeats is based on their ability to form triplexes (an alternative model suggests that epigenetic changes may also be important). Duplex opening within the repeated region, due to the passage of RNA polymerase, is thought to allow one of the separated single strands to form Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds with the purine strand of a B-DNA duplex within the same repeated sequence. This leads to the formation of a 3-stranded helix. Its formation on the non-template GAA strand in frataxin probably interferes with RNA polymerase progression. The free template strand is then thought to base pair with the newly synthesised RNA transcript, forming stable RNA/DNA dimers and preventing further transcription.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Now, this is only a model, for a specific type of structure within the context of a specific disease. And although different sequences have been shown to form these unusual structures, and these structures to be somehow associated with specific diseases, to neatly demonstrate how exactly one influences the other seems to be quite hard. This is particularly difficult because different groups often use different model organisms or protocols, leading to sometimes contradictory results. Overall, although I liked writing about this topic, since I had never considered how the structure of DNA could have an impact on disease, I got the feeling that a lot of work still needs to be done before convincing evidence is given for how exactly these structures impact on our wellbeing, and what sort of therapeutics can be developed from this knowledge.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early May (I was &amp;lt;this&amp;gt; close to capitalising &amp;quot;Early&amp;quot; because I write about archaeological periods all the time.) metal detectorists on Bornholm, Denmark, &lt;a href="http://www.bornholmsmuseum.dk/arkeologi/nyefund8.htm"&gt;rediscovered&lt;/a&gt; one of the earliest-documented find spots of &lt;i&gt;guldgubbar&lt;/i&gt;. These are tiny embossed gold foils depicting people: usually a single man, sometimes an embracing man and woman, less frequently a single woman. They are a diagnostic artefact type of the Vendel Period's elite manor sites (AD 530-790). A cool thing about the new find is that is contains gold bracteates as well, which suggests that we are dealing with one of the last goldsmith sites of the Migration Period as well as one of the Vendel Period's first. And there is even one of the Migration Period's rare little round-sculpture figurines, famous among Swedish archaeologists since the find of &lt;a href="http://fornvannen.se/pdf/2000talet/2003_124.pdf"&gt;three such at Lunda in Strängnäs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The identification of the old find spot is plausible both from the scant information in the early publication and through the similar and rare artefact types found. A thorough rescue excavation has now been done to clean the site of gold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/07/newold_6th_century_find_on_bor/bornholmgummor.jpg" width="500" height="555" alt="bornholmgummor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends of the &lt;a href="http://fornvannen.se/pdf/2000talet/2007_119.pdf"&gt;Kaga lady&lt;/a&gt; will recognise two such images of high-born wives™ in the new find: one smaller mounted on an iron plaque and one larger, folded over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/upload/2009/07/newold_6th_century_find_on_bor/bornholmbrakt.jpg" width="500" height="372" alt="bornholmbrakt.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gold bracteates in the find are weird, having an unusually stylised and small central motif engraved on a square die, when they are almost always larger and round. This is because the goldsmith has used a punch intended for the concentric rows of decorative punch marks on a large bracteate's rim zone instead of a real bracteate die. This too suggests an unusual bracteate production milieu, arguably a very late one. The find of May 2009 will figure largely in future discussions of these things.&lt;/p&gt;

Dear Richard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a member of many online forums and LiveJournal communities. Whenever the subject of things such as ghosts, religion, astrology, homeopathy and other bizarre things come up, I often feel the need to make the lone dissenting comment. For example, occasionally the question of  “Do you believe in Ghosts?!” comes up, and my standard response is “I prefer to live in a reality-based world.” I understand this probably isn’t the most unconfrontational approach, but on one level I rather enjoy starting the debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a good way to go about this without being a jerk? Does anyone ever “win” these types of conversations? Should I even be commenting on these posts when I’m just going to get laughed at and told that “Science can’t explain everything”? I feel as though when I walk away from these types of conversations without contributing at least a token skeptical or Atheist viewpoint, I lose an opportunity to show the world that other sides exist. I want to be an Out Atheist, but perhaps I need to scale it back a bit so as not to get overwhelmed, or simply come across as a jerk?  Any advice on this would be helpful! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to be an Out Atheist
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Trying,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you have some new attitudes mixed with some old habits.  I agree with you that it is important to offer dissenting opinions, especially if they are reality-based.  Superstitious or rumor-based ideas left unchallenged tend to grow into destructive monstrosities.  Sometimes they can become so hurtful that the skeptics among us become angry and then react with that anger to even the smallest bit of woo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can help to keep your overall desired outcome in mind, and steer toward that goal.  Ask yourself if you’d like the woo-believing person to begin to question things critically, or if you’d rather enjoy the sadistic pleasure of humiliating and ridiculing them in a public forum, even though that will most likely not change their way of thinking about woo, and will only make them hate all people with your point of view.   I’m not saying that you do that, but I used to.  I could be very hurtful of the person as well as their argument, and I am not proud of that. The fact that you want to avoid being a jerk shows that you have a good heart, and so all you need are some new habits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help someone to see more clearly, don’t start off by poking them in the eye.  Before you say something, listen to the implied statement that often is inside an overt statement. For instance, replying to the question about believing in ghosts with  “I prefer to live in a reality-based world” sounds like you’re saying,  “I live in a better world than yours, and you are inferior.”  Now, you might even candidly think that, but saying it is the poke in his eye that will not help him to see clearly. All he will be aware of is his hurt feelings and his resentment of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, try “I prefer to withhold belief in things until I see convincing evidence, and so far, I have never seen convincing evidence of ghosts.”  That expresses your basic skeptical stance, and introduces the concept of evidence to him.  It does not insult or belittle him, and it even subtly challenges him to find some evidence to offer.  You don’t have to respect what he believes, you don’t have to respect what he does with those beliefs, &lt;em&gt;but you can still speak to him respectfully.&lt;/em&gt;  Your dignity gives your words as much power as does your logic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the effect that the tone and implications of your remarks will have on the other person’s emotions. This doesn’t mean that you pussyfoot around and avoid confrontation of any kind, it means that you can be the dissenting voice for reality by stating your view of the &lt;em&gt;issue&lt;/em&gt; rather than your view of their &lt;em&gt;worth.&lt;/em&gt;  Try to imagine yourself in their shoes, and ask yourself how would you react if you were on the receiving end of what you’re about to say.  Would a half-hidden insult really cause you to question your superstitious thinking?  Perhaps a respectful offer of a different method of thinking would subtly coax you toward rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Does anyone ever “win” these types of conversations?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think so.  What exactly would “winning” mean? That the person says, “Oh my goodness, you’ve shown me the light. I hereby abandon all my woo belief forever!”? That’s not likely. After thousands of such discussions I’ve never seen that.   Or would “winning” be that your insults are clearly more clever and stinging than his?  How sad and ugly a waste of your creativity that would be.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as planting seeds.  The seeds of reason and skepticism grow best when planted gently, just under the surface, not when stomped into the ground with the heel of a boot.  For most people, giving up superstitious thinking is a gradual process.  You might never see the final germination of the seeds you plant, and so you’ll not be able to say you “won.” Many other skeptics will be adding their encouragement before the person embraces reason.  The real winner is the person who matures to become more reasonable, and all those who benefit from his improved thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I even be commenting on these posts when I’m just going to get laughed at and told that “Science can’t explain everything”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unkind laughter doesn’t change your way of thinking, it only makes you hurt.  So it can help you to remember to not use the same counter-productive method on others.  If it gets to be too hurtful, it’s perfectly okay to say “Ouch! That hurt my feelings even though it did not even dent my argument,” and then take a break to cool down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To “Science can’t explain everything” I have responded with something like this: There will always be mystery and wonder, there will always be the unexplained. That is because mystery and wonder come from the human mind, rather than from the world about which we wonder; and things will be unexplained because the human mind will always be asking even more demanding questions as soon as things become explained.  What science can explain, it can explain well, in terms that almost anyone can understand, if they have the patience to listen and learn.  Many things that were once unexplained are now the stuff of grade school.  To assume that any particular thing will remain unexplained forever is probably foolish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep trying, Trying.  Being an “out” atheist who is not a jerk simply takes patience, empathy, honesty, self respect and practice.  I have the impression that you are capable of all of those in abundance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, I was really, really tempted to blog this over the weekend, even though I was at The Amazing Meeting and even though I had promised myself that I would not blog during the meeting. It was that tempting. Now it's a few days after I first learned about it, and I wondered it it was still worth blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story begins with, seemingly innocently enough, a &lt;a href="http://www.lymphomas.org.uk/news/news.asp?newsid=60"&gt;press release by the Lymphoma Association&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are delighted to announce the appointment of our new Chief Executive, Sally Penrose.

&lt;p&gt;Sally joined us at the beginning of July.  She brings with her a wealth of experience as a communications specialist from the private and third sectors; including 8 years as Chief Executive of the British Homeopathic Association and Faculty of Homeopathy, where she worked closely with both patients and the medical profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I read that right? The &lt;a href="http://www.trusthomeopathy.org"&gt;British Homeopathic Associatio&lt;/a&gt;n and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faculty_of_Homeopathy"&gt;Faculty of Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat that one more time: the British Homeopathic Association and Faculty of Homeopathy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/a_homeopathy_apologist_takes_over_the_ly.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/a_homeopathy_apologist_takes_over_the_ly.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/2p8zoS1EEc4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247666198580"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=576">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/198a3f2e16cd570d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution"/><title type="html">Texas Update</title><published>2009-07-15T13:55:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T13:55:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=576" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have been following the saga is Texas for a few years now – Texas is one of the major battlegrounds between science and ideology in education. The Texas board of education has been roughly evenly split between those dedicated to science and those dedicated to promoting their religious views through public education, specifically by attacking the teaching of evolution and cosmology and trying to sneak in creationist arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently we heard the good news that the Chairman of the Texas BOE, Don (”someone has to stand up to those experts”) McLeroy, was removed as Chairman.  This was nice, but I did not get too excited – governor Rick Perry, who appointed McLeroy in the first place, is still in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief time he seemed to be considering Cynthia Dunbar, perhaps the most anti-evolution member of the Texas BOE, for the post. The Teach them Science website &lt;a href="http://www.teachthemscience.org/texas/sboe#dunbar"&gt;reports about Dunbar&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her book, One Nation Under God (Onward, 2008), Dunbar (on p. 100) calls public education a “subtly deceptive tool of perversion.” She charges that the establishment of public schools is unconstitutional and even “tyrannical” because it threatens the authority of families, granted by God through Scripture, to direct the instruction of their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a collective sigh of relief when we heard that Dunbar would not be appointed. But keep in mind, she is still on the BOE – someone who thinks public education is a “tool of perversion.”  But again the relief was short lived -Rick Perry has picked instead &lt;a href="http://www.teachthemscience.org/texas/sboe#lowe"&gt;Gail Lowe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe is also a creationist, and though not as rabid as Dunbar, favors the “strengths and weaknesses” approach to sneaking in creationist arguments and watering down the teaching of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others have pointed out that she seems to be impressed by the “polystrate fossils” creationist argument. The blog &lt;a href="http://halfempth.blogspot.com/2009/01/sboe-member-gail-lowe-life-of-smug.html"&gt;Half Empty&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of exposing this bit of creationist idiocy.  Essentially, it is based on a view of geology and paleontology that is oversimplified to the point of being wrong. She assumes that uniformitarianism (not the religion), the notion that changes over geological time result from present day forces extrapolated over millions of years, is always true and explains all of geology. The modern view, based upon the evidence, is that there are uniform processes in nature that shape geology, but these are punctuated by regular catastrophies – meteor impact, volcanic eruptions, mud slides, etc. Therefore, animals and plants are sometimes buried before they fossilize, sometimes in feet of mud or ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “polystrate” fossil argument of creationists is that uniformitarianism cannot explain how millions of years of sediments could form around a large fossil, a tree trunk for example,which spans many layers of sediment. This is true but irrelevant, since modern geology allows for catastrophic events also. Once again, in attempting to argue against evolution creationists only expose their own ignorance of evolution and related sciences, like geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This woman, Lowe, is now the Chairperson of the Texas BOE. I don’t expect every BOE member to be an expert in every field taught by the public school system, but I do expect them not to substitute their own opinions for the knowledge of actual experts. I wonder if Lowe shares McLeroy’s disdain for experts. Of course, dismissing expert opinion is convenient when your own opinions run contrary to logic and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247665832964"><id gr:original-id="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/?p=3164">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/115a5dabfa3d6545</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><title type="html">Unscientific America etc. etc.</title><published>2009-07-15T13:28:23Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T13:28:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/unscientific-america-etc-etc/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a note: I’ll post a full review of &lt;em&gt;UA&lt;/em&gt; in early August, as exigent circumstances require me to hold off on posting about this for a while.   In the interim, don’t burn yourself out!&lt;/p&gt;

Two people who had walked out of a local store and did not see the accident came over and yelled at me.

&lt;p&gt;I won’t even be briefer and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/08/a-ghouls-q-what-do-you-call-psychic-mediums/"&gt;call them &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; ghouls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But golly, you have to wonder, just a little bit, about some of them who are just so freakin’ bad at it. Take James van Praagh. He claims he can talk to the dead, but they never seem to give him any information he can actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt;. Or maybe they just tease him, constantly changing what they say, giving him ambiguous clues, only supplying the first letter in someone’s name, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why take my word for it? My friend, the skeptic Jose Alvarez, put together &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uesL1lAX-Jc"&gt;this intreresting video about van Praagh&lt;/a&gt;, which he showed me at TAM 7. I suggest not eating anything while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/uesL1lAX-Jc%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a technique, called cold reading, where you basically just start making guesses about what someone is thinking. You then use their body language, their responses, to narrow down your guesses until you get close enough to what they’re thinking that they actually think you’re correct. I’ve seen it done, and someone who is even mildly talented at it can hone in on an &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; in just a few seconds. I suppose van Praagh might be an unusually inept cold reader, or perhaps he is just being toyed with by capricious spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it’s that latter case, then &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; would be the victim, and I’m having a hard time buying that. It looks to me that the real victim is on the other side of the guesswork, the grieving people who are just looking desperately for some closure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arm yourself with skepticism because, sadly, not all ghouls are fictional. As long as people are emotionally vulnerable and not thinking critically, cold readers will never be out of work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247665078814"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8205">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b1880c20317e1006</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 7.15</title><published>2009-07-15T13:00:07Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T13:00:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8205" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Hayre Fellowship in Public Outreach&lt;/a&gt;, designed to inspire and motivate the next generation of research advocates.  From the AMP press release:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The importance of animal research to medical progress will be highlighted in projects by three graduate students selected as Michael D. Hayre Fellows in Public Outreach, Americans for Medical Progress announced today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gillian Branden-Weiss and Breanna Caltagarone, students the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine, and Megan Wyeth of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, will inform and engage the public as advocates for biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braden-Weiss and Caltagarone will create a "Thank a Mouse" interactive campaign for private practice veterinarians and their clients.  Through the development of a website and other interactive materials, they will focus on the many contributions of animal research to veterinary treatments that help pets, livestock and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyeth, a graduate student who conducts epilepsy research at UCLA, will expand the advocacy group Pro-Test for Science on the UCLA campus and create a model for similar student organizations throughout America.  This April, Wyeth was a leader of an historic rally by Pro-Test that drew over 800 to stand in support of scientists targeted by animal rights extremists. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/americans_for_medical_progress.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/americans_for_medical_progress.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/wSX5HVrXTA0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247664976801"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/there_is_a_family_resemblance.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b186fda26b23ccda</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Fossils"/><title type="html">There is a family resemblance</title><published>2009-07-15T13:10:21Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T13:10:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/pfXElTKw9bQ/there_is_a_family_resemblance.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/there_is_a_family_resemblance.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's an interesting use of tweening: take 5 fossil skulls, use the computer to interpolate between them, and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcqA8wEljPM"&gt;animate the results&lt;/a&gt;. 3.5 million years just fly by in 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

The Federal Trade Commission is looking closely at "product placement" on blogs and online more generally. Eager to get the word out, companies are only too glad to send out samples of their products to bloggers. As yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/13/technology/internet/13blog.html?ref=business"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of paid sponsorships online has not been without controversy. Some in the online world deride the actions as kickbacks. Others also question the legitimacy of bloggers’ opinions, even when the commercial relationships are clearly outlined to readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Federal Trade Commission is taking a hard look at such practices and may soon require online media to comply with disclosure rules under its truth-in-advertising guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2008/11/P034520endorsementguides.pdf"&gt;draft of the new rules&lt;/a&gt; [a &lt;a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2008/11/P034520endorsementguides.pdf"&gt;PDF file&lt;/a&gt; of these is &lt;a href="http://www.ftc.gov/os/2008/11/P034520endorsementguides.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;] was posted for public comments this year and the staff is to make a formal recommendation to be presented to the commissioners for a vote, perhaps by early fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting when I was blogging on Autism Vox, I've received emails to get autism-related "stuff" from devices to help a child sleep to supplements. I've only said yes to books, many from &lt;a href="http://www.jkp.com/"&gt;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&lt;/a&gt;, which produces a number of titles about autism. I try to write briefly about most, while not always able to do full reviews. On my list to complete before the summer is over are: A more complete review of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_horse_father"&gt;The Horse Boy&lt;/a&gt; and also a review of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_story_of_noah_greenfeld"&gt;Boy Alone&lt;/a&gt;. I also have a copy of the revised &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Engaging-Autism-Children-Communicate-Floortime/dp/0738210285"&gt;Engaging Autism&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Stanley Greenspan on my table, as I'm curious about what's been changed since the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/engaging-floortime-2-greenspan-on-how-autism-develops/"&gt;first edition&lt;/a&gt;. (Actually, there's a part of me that just wants to write reviews of books about autism.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also did request and receive a copy of the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/can_a_dvd_teach_emotions"&gt;Transporters DVD&lt;/a&gt; and appreciated being able to show it to Charlie to see what he thought about it. (He wasn't interested at all.) I don't think I would have been able to have said anything beyond speculation without seeing how Charlie responded to the DVD. It's been no to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;other stuff&lt;/a&gt;. Also (so you know), I get a regular supply of emails about autism conferences, autism videos, studies about autism, studies about various health topics (obesity, for one), and usually say "thank you, I prefer not" to writing about most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am getting a little on my ethical high horse here. But what I really wish to note is that, as Dora put it, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_device_is_just_a_device"&gt;a device is just a device&lt;/a&gt;. There's so many &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;things&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; that get touted as "helping autistic kids"; the best thing that anyone any gave Charlie was their free time, their compassion, their regard; their patience to really get to know him not based on preconceived notions of autism, but based on actual experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to joke that not only did we choose the toys to give to Charlie as Christmas and birthday presents; it often felt that we were choosing the toys for ourselves, as we had to teach Charlie to play with them and, indeed to be, interested in them. In twelve years of parenting Charlie, one lesson finally learned is that he pretty much chooses what he wants, based on what is around him, and his preference has never been for any neat new techno-dohicky. Lately the thing he first asks and reaches for has been a strand of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/worry_beads"&gt;olive green worry beads&lt;/a&gt;. Charlie's often just been asking me for "green"; we quickly supply the noun so his request is a bit more precise. And those &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/worry_beads"&gt;worry beads&lt;/a&gt; were mom-and-dad-supplied (meant to be gifts for friends at work; they didn't mind that Charlie claimed them). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, not planning to go into any kind of business marketing those as the latest "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/more_stress_on_stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;-reducer" for kids on the spectrum. Just glad to have stumbled upon something that Charlie likes!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247663566951"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_14_interpreting_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/472d77faab7e5a92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">Clock Tutorial #14:  Interpreting The Phase Response Curve</title><published>2009-07-15T11:45:16Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T11:45:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/sOxvt5VJf_Y/clock_tutorial_14_interpreting_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_14_interpreting_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://circadiana.blogspot.com/2005/04/interpreting-phase-response-curve.html" title="Clock Tutorial #14:  Interpreting The Phase Response Curve"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clock Tutorial #14:  Interpreting The Phase Response Curve" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the sixth post in a series about mechanism of entrainment, running all day today on this blog.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done some interviews about this, and been asked about it endlessly: will the LRO’s incredibly high-resolution images of the lunar surface, including, eventually, the Apollo landing sites, finally quell the lunacy of the Moon Hoax believers?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That would be nice, but obviously it won’t. If they don’t believe the thousands of pictures and video taken from the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts themselves, why would they believe further NASA evidence? And besides, these true believers don’t live in an evidence-based world. They live in fantasy; it’s the only way they can be shown &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/foxapollo.html"&gt;solid proof their claims are wrong&lt;/a&gt; and yet still cleave to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go into details, but happily &lt;a href="http://cumbriansky.wordpress.com/2009/07/05/lro-and-the-apollo-hoax-believers/"&gt;the Cumbrian Sky blog&lt;/a&gt; already makes these points pretty well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me, I will be happy to sit back and reminisce about Apollo, look over the new LRO imagery, and think about the future of space exploration with some optimism (and fight for the progress to be done rationally!), all the while ignoring the ignorant bleatings of the Apollo deniers. Sixty years from now, when people are celebrating the centenary of the first human to set foot on another world, I think the Hoax will be so long dead and gone that they won’t even know enough to ask, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/sibrel.html"&gt;Sibrel&lt;/a&gt; who?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a future I can look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247661436668"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/nasa_really_did_find_lost_tape.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1d9fddad92be692a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cosmos"/><title type="html">NASA Really Did Find Lost Tapes That Don't Exist ...</title><published>2009-07-15T12:51:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T12:51:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/0qeWd-FevTc/nasa_really_did_find_lost_tape.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/nasa_really_did_find_lost_tape.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;... Maybe ....  Sorta.... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/06/lost_moon_tapes_found_in_perth.php"&gt;We've been burned by this one before. &lt;/a&gt;  As you will recall, the claim was made that the visuals we all saw of the first steps on the moon by humans were a black and white compressed image sent from Australia, shown on a TV at Mission Control (or someplace) and then shot with an old fashioned TV camera (they only had the "old fashioned" ones back in those days, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, we were told, high quality color videos were taken at the same time but then lost right away.  Then, we were told, they were found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we were told by other people who seemed to know what they were talking about that these higher quality tapes did not exist, could not have existed, because the camera needed to make them was not sent to the moon on that first trip. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now we have something directly fro NASA:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/nasa_really_did_find_lost_tape.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/nasa_really_did_find_lost_tape.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/0qeWd-FevTc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247660710518"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=560">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b38b863f5fa1124f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Report from the SBM Conference</title><published>2009-07-15T12:13:18Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T12:13:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=560" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On July 9th we held our first Science Based Medicine conference in Las Vegas. The event was definitely a success – we filled our room to capacity (150 attendees) and almost everyone stayed until the end. It also appeared that most attendees were actually awake, a rarity for a full-day medical conference. The Q&amp;amp;A session at the end was lively and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimball Atwood and I covered the history of science-based medicine and explored the differences between EBM and SBM. David Gorski discussed cancer quackery, including specific cases to illustrate the potential harm of pursuing worthless therapies for serious diseases. Harriet Hall gave us an overview of the the pseudoscience endemic in chiropractic. Mark Crislip discussed the chronic Lyme disease controversy. And Val Jones discussed health information online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based upon the feedback from those attending the conference, as well as the general enthusiasm, it seems that there is a hunger for this type of information. The audience was split about even between health care professionals and interested lay public. Many people asked if we plan on giving the conference again, and the answer is definitely yes. We have no plans set as of yet, and will certainly announce any future conferences here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of editors and authors at SBM is deep and growing, so we have more than enough speakers to draw from. Also, the list of potential topics to cover is likewise long – we barely scratched the surface at this conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two broad themes in the questions we were asked, both during the Q&amp;amp;A and after the conference. The first is if we plan to make the content of the conference available for wider distribution. The answer to that question is definitely yes. We, of course, all have our slide presentations and written descriptions of each lecture. But also the entire conference was recorded on video, which gives us the option of releasing it in either DVD or podcast format. We have not yet decided which and how many of these formats we will use, and of course will make any announcements here. We are also exploring the possibility of attaching CME to the content if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other type of question we received was how to get involved in promoting SBM. There were many excellent suggestions, most of which were things we have already considered but simply lack the resources to put into effect. For example, several people suggested that we add new kinds of content to the SBM site – such as a page dedicated to each major topic with a description and list of resources. We have, in fact, already started to write an index of our SBM posts by topic, but this is a great deal of work and we all are most limited in our most precious resource – time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments of this post can also serve as a place to share with us your suggestions as to what kinds of resources would be most useful – where should we focus our efforts? But I also made the point that we need volunteers as well as suggestions. While we are all dedicated to working toward improving and expanding this site, new projects require new resources. So if you have a suggestion, be prepared to be asked to chip in. Many people did step up and volunteer their help, which is greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways people can help promote quality science-based medicine. In addition to submitting guest entries for this blog, you can stay alert to political activity in your state. Is someone trying to pass a bill to water down the standard of care? Let us know, and also make your voice heard by writing to your representatives and governor. If you has a skill you think might be useful, let us know and we will discuss how you can help. And any new projects we take on will certainly go faster if the workload is spread out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example – indexing all the posts at SBM by topic, and collecting relevant links and references. Many people asked if there was one place they could go to learn everything they need to know about the vaccine autism controversy. What a wonderful resource that would be, and we could host it right here at SBM – all it takes is time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the SBM conference taught me is that there is a growing network of people who are concerned about the quality of science in medicine. SBM and the standard of care have been systematically attacked over the last two decades and significant damage has been done at every level – political, academic, institutional, and regulatory. SBM is more than a blog – it is a rallying call. We need to re-dedicate the medical profession to quality science, and put an end to tolerating pseudoscience simply because it is called by a pleasant euphamism.&lt;/p&gt;

It can survive in frozen soils and stomach acid. It can can build intricate tails which it can then spin hundreds of times a second in order to swim. It can navigate away from the bad and towards the good. It can protect itself from overheating by making just enough protective proteins it needs, with thermostat-like precision. It can survive starvation by folding its DNA into a crystalline sandwich and powering down for months, even years in some cases. It can build microbial cities out of goo, and even commit suicide to help its fellow &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I may have underestimated the brainless intelligence of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. It may even be able to  predict the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; has 4000-odd genes, which it can use in various combinations to meet the many challenges it faces. But it does not use all those genes to make proteins and RNA molecules all at once. That would not only be a spectacular waste of energy. Instead,&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;  turns some genes on and keeps others turned off, a bit like playing the keys of a piano. Proteins can clamp onto stretches of DNA near certain genes, for example, making it impossible for the microbe to read them and make the corresponding proteins. When those proteins fall off, or are pried away, the genes can be switched on. (Likewise, other proteins can clamp onto other stretches of DNA and speed up the reading of genes as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1965/press.html"&gt;One of the most important chapters in the history of modern biology&lt;/a&gt; was the discovery of these switches in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. In later years, scientists discovered this basic on-off strategy at work (with lots of variations, of course) in the DNA of all living things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way in which &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;’s genes switch on and off is well-suited to its particular kind of life. For example, &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;can make proteins that allow it to feed on lactose, the sugar in milk. But most of the time, it keeps the genes for those proteins shut down. If it should encounter lactose, however, the sugar molecule can pull away the repressing proteins, initiating a series of events that leads to &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; producing a lot of lactose-digesting proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a case like this, &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;is responding to something that’s already present in its environment. So-called “higher” species, like us, can also respond to signals of things to come. In fact, thanks to our brains, we can learn new signals. (Think of Pavlov’s dogs, drooling at the sound of the dinner bell.) That led scientists at Princeton to wonder whether &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; can see into the future as well. It may not have a brain made up of billions of cells, but it does have a complex network of genes that might be able to use information to make predictions about things to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Princeton scientists started by considering &lt;em&gt;E. coli’&lt;/em&gt;s natural history. You get regularly infected with new &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; carried from your hands to your mouth. (Fortunately, the vast majority of these bacteria are totally harmless. Just remember, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/06/microcosm-week-theres-evolution-in-my-cookie-dough/"&gt;don’t eat raw cookie dough&lt;/a&gt;!) For the &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that’s just arrived in your mouth, the world begins to change. It immediately gets a lot warmer, for one thing. Later, as it moves from your mouth down through your gut, the level of oxygen in its environment will drop to near zero. In order to survive,  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; has to shut down the network of genes it uses to metabolize sugar with the help of oxygen, and then switch on hundreds of other genes for feeding without oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sudden rise in temperature is a reliable signal that oxygen will start to drop over the next few hours. The Princeton scientists wondered if  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; might use it as a cue to start to prepare for the change. To find out, they experimented on some  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, keeping careful track of which genes were turned on and off when they tweaked the temperature and oxygen levels. It turns out that when  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; gets warm, it not only switches on heat-defense genes, but also starts making the switch to low-oxygen genes. This switch is remarkable when you consider that it can happen while  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; is bathing in a broth rich in oxygen. Unless the oxygen is going to drop soon, this would be a disastrous decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was possible, though, that  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; has to switch to a low-oxygen program whenever it defends itself against high temperatures. To test that possibility, the scientists turned  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;’s world upside-down. They periodically raised and lowered both the oxygen levels and the temperature in flasks of  &lt;em&gt;E. coli. &lt;/em&gt;But now a rise in temperature was followed 40 minutes later by a &lt;em&gt;rise&lt;/em&gt; in oxygen, not a drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists allowed the bacteria to grow and reproduce for hundreds of generations in this bizarro world. Mutations arose, and beneficial ones spread through the population thanks to natural selection. The scientists then took a look at the bacteria after they had adapted to the new pattern of temperature and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a rise in temperature prompted a far weaker response from the genes  &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; uses to survive at low-oxygen levels. The bacteria with mutations that allowed them to continue using oxygen outcompeted the ones that automatically made the switch when the temperature rose. Their experiment suggests that the programs the bacteria use to survive high temperatures and different levels of oxygen are not inextricably linked. The link must be an adaptation, the scientists argue. At some point in the past, the ancestors of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; evolved the microbial wisdom that a rise in temperature foreshadows a drop in oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Princeton scientists &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/320/5881/1313"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the details of their experiment a year ago. Now, in the current issue of &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, a team of Israeli scientists offer evidence that &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; predicts the future &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7252/abs/nature08112.html"&gt;in another way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli scientists noted another reliable clue &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; gets on its journy from mouth to gut. Thanks to the chemistry of our intestines, the upper part of the digestive tract has lactose on offer, but further down in the gut, another sugar called maltose is available. The Israeli scientists wondered &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; “know” that if it encountered lactose, maltose would be coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they looked at which genes switched on when they fed &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;different kinds of sugar. Feeding it maltose caused it to make a lot of proteins for digesting maltose. But feeding it lactose caused it not just to make lactose-digesting proteins, but low levels of proteins for digesting maltose too. The effect did not go in the other direction, though. Feeding &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;maltose does not cause it to make a lot of lactose-digesting proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli scientists then ran an experiment to see if there was any advantage to &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; making the maltose proteins in response to lactose. There is indeed. Bacteria that are first exposed to lactose actually grow faster &lt;em&gt;on maltose&lt;/em&gt; than bacteria that feed on maltose alone. Other sugars can’t give &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; this priming advantage. Nor does the advantage work in reverse. Exposing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; to maltose does not speed up its growth on lactose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Israeli scientists ran an evolution experiment of their own. They fed &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;high levels of lactose without any maltose. Under these conditions, making maltose-digesting proteins in response to lactose is a waste of energy. After 500 generations, the scientists found, the bacteria stopped making maltose proteins in response to lactose (although they could still make them in response to maltose itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; does not actually learn to make associations the way Pavlov’s dogs learned. The neurons in the brains of the dogs altered their connections. &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; evolves new connections between its genes over the course of hundreds of generations, as mutations offer up new arrangements, and natural selection favors the ones that speed up the bacteria’s growth. But these experiments do illuminate some of the interesting ways in which evolution resembles learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentary that accompanies the new paper has the clever headline, “Microbes exploit groundhog day.” In the movie &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;, you may recall, Bill Murray &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_yDWQsrajA"&gt;wakes up day after day only to find that it’s still February 2&lt;/a&gt;. After a while, he starts to look clairvoyant to the people around him, because he can anticipate everything that’s going to happen. In some respects, life is a lot like &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;. Things repeat themselves in a predictable order. Perhaps body temperature and low oxygen are like &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps lactose and maltose are too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, a lot of life is not like&lt;em&gt; Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;. In many cases we can’t predict the future, and so we can’t know exactly what to do now to be best prepared. The same goes for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. So what does &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It pretends that it’s betting on horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to find out how it does that particular trick, you’ll have to read about it in  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307276864?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0307276864"&gt;Microcosm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the glimmer of imagination and possibility that can give rise to years of research and fascinating advances in our knowledge of the world.  But it is still just the preliminary stage - when people say something is "just a theory", they are thinking of the colloquial meaning which is more analogous to hypothesis.  It's a weak form of knowledge, little better than conjecture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the power of the hypothetical goes beyond that.  In philosophy, hypothetical scenarios are often (or indeed exhaustively) used to examine arguments, beliefs, and assumptions - of which the subject is sometimes previously unaware of using / having / making.  I'm currently leafing through a book full of such hypotheticals - called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pig-That-Wants-Eaten-Experiments/dp/0452287448"&gt;The Pig That Wants To Be Eaten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  The title is perfectly demonstrative of the kind of thinking contained therein - thought experiments which are often semi-nonsensical, but which nevertheless challenge us to examine our underlying reasons for what we believe.  &lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt; it immoral to eat a pig that wants to be eaten (assuming it is immoral to eat one that does not)?  And if so, why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Matrix_Poster.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c1/The_Matrix_Poster.jpg" style="float:right;margin-left:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is one of the reasons I so enjoy science fiction - there is such an immense crossover with so many areas of philosophy, and there is no better arena for bringing thought experiments and hypotheticals into the mainstream consciousness.  Just look at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - how many people had questioned the very nature of reality, and the evidence of their senses, before watching that film?  Every philosopher was familiar with the idea, of course - as it was an imaginative adaptation of Descartes' hyperbolic doubt and evil demon hypothetical.  But it wasn't &lt;i&gt;well-known&lt;/i&gt;, in the public sense of the phrase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it seems the hypothetical has been given yet more power - or rather, yet another facet of its power has been discovered.  Previous to this recent research, people were often encouraged to promote a positive outlook in themselves by focusing on the good things in their lives, "counting their blessings", as it were.  However, studies into this method returned mixed results at best, and a new hypothesis was tested - that, rather than simply thinking about the positive aspects of one's life, one should &lt;i&gt;imagine&lt;/i&gt; what one's life would be like had those things never happened at all.  The contrast this creates between the present and the parallel (and negative) "possible presents" reinforces the positivity of one's life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So next time, instead of just thinking "it could be worse", perhaps you should actually think about exactly &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; it could be worse.  And how easily it might have turned out that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Personality+and+Social+Psychology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1037%2Fa0013316&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=It%27s+a+wonderful+life%3A+Mentally+subtracting+positive+events+improves+people%27s+affective+states%2C+contrary+to+their+affective+forecasts.&amp;amp;rft.issn=1939-1315&amp;amp;rft.date=2008&amp;amp;rft.volume=95&amp;amp;rft.issue=5&amp;amp;rft.spage=1217&amp;amp;rft.epage=1224&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fdoi.apa.org%2Fgetdoi.cfm%3Fdoi%3D10.1037%2Fa0013316&amp;amp;rft.au=Koo%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Algoe%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Wilson%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=Gilbert%2C+D.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Philosophy%2CPhilosophy+of+Mind"&gt;Koo, M., Algoe, S., Wilson, T., &amp;amp; Gilbert, D.

Sigh… people don’t seem to learn. It’s been almost 22 years (yikes!) since a distinguished group of scientists published a letter in Cell calling for a responsible use of the word “homology”. If you were born when that letter was published, then in the US you can already drink legally. [...]...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Chiropractors don’t want to be grouped in with fairies and organic farmers don’t want to be grouped in with Big Foot, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I love this quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“New Age is an umbrella term encompassing anything on a spiritual path — Bigfoot, Jesus, Buddha. Even worshipping a frog is sort of OK,” McGee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love PZ Myers’ very awesome response to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute…worshipping a frog is &lt;em&gt;sort of OK&lt;/em&gt;? Only “sort of”? I am offended. Why is she belittling the faith of frog-worshippers all around the world?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates quite well why New Age’s strength is also its greatest weakness. No matter how accepting you are of other beliefs (even to an absurd degree), there’s always something that’s just too stupid. I’m reminded of the creationists who fight tooth and nail to lower the science standards to get their religion taught in schools. It never crosses their mind that they’re making it that much easier for every other religion and pseudoscience to be taught in science classes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t have it both ways. You can’t be open to absolutely all beliefs with no standards at all and still have any respectability. And while certain modalities might like the advantages that come with being associated with a New Age culture that’s so gullible they’ll buy whatever you’re selling, being associated with New Age beliefs also keeps them from reaching the more rational markets. If you trade in bullshit, you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s good to see the BMJ joining the campaign for free speech (only a month or two behind the blogs).  The &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1630"&gt;suing of Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt; for defamation by the British Chiropractic Association has stirred up a hornet’s nest that could (one hopes)  change the law of the land, and destroy chiropractic altogether.  The BMJ’s editor, Fiona Godlee, has a fine editorial, &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/jul08_4/b2783"&gt;Keep the libel laws out of science&lt;/a&gt;. She starts “I hope all readers of the BMJ are signed up to organised scepticism” and says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Weak science sheltered from criticism by officious laws means bad medicine. Singh is determined to fight the lawsuit rather than apologise for an article he believes to be sound. He and his supporters have in their sights not only the defence of this case but the reform of England’s libel laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godlee refers to equally fine articles by the BMJ’s Deputy Editor, Tony Delamothe, &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/339/jul08_3/b2771"&gt;Thinking about Charles II&lt;/a&gt;“, and by Editor in Chief, Harvey Marcovitch, “&lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/jul08_4/b2759"&gt;Libel law in the UK&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/jul08_4/b2783"&gt;comments on Godlee’s editorial&lt;/a&gt;, show strong support, (apart from one from the infamous quantum fantasist, &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=shpalman+milgrom&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;Lionel Milgrom&lt;/a&gt;).  But there was one that slighlty surprised me, from Tricia Greenhalgh, author of the superb book, &lt;a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_5a0UyIOx_MC&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;“How to read a paper”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/jul08_4/b2783#216745"&gt;She comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“the use of the term ‘bogus’ seems both unprofessional and unscholarly. The argument would be stronger if expressed in more reserved terms”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That set me thinking, not for the first time, about the difference between journalism and scholarship.  I can’t imagine ever using a word like ‘bogus’ in a paper about single ion channels. But Singh was writing in a newspaper, not in a scientific paper. Even more to the point, his comments were aimed at people who are not scholars and who, quite explicitly reject the normal standards of science and evidence.   The scholarly approach has been tried for centuries, and it just doesn’t work with such people.  I’d defend Singh’s language. It is the only way to have any effect.  That is why I sent the following comment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate irony is that the comment was held up by the BMJ’s lawyers, and has still to appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for an excellent editorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that it’s worth replying to Lionel Milgrom whose fantasy physics has been totally demolished by &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=shpalman+milgrom&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;real physicists&lt;/a&gt;.  Trisha Greenhalgh is, though, someone whose views I’d take very seriously.  She raises an interesting question when she says “bogus” is an unprofessional word to use.  Two things seem relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there is little point in writing rational scholarly articles for a group of people who do not accept the ordinary rules of evidence or scholarship. We are dealing with fantasists.  Worse still, we are dealing with fantasists whose income depends on defending their fantasies. You can point out to your heart’s content that “subluxations” are figment of the chiropractors’ imagination, but they don’t give a damn. They aren’t interested in what’s true and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my lifetime, pharmacologists and others have been writing scholarly articles about how homeopathy and other sorts of alternative medicine are bogus.  All this effort had little effect.   What made the difference was blogs and investigative journalism.  When it became possible to reveal leaked teaching materials that taught students that “&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=227"&gt;amethysts emit high yin energy&lt;/a&gt;“, and name and shame the vice-chancellors who allow that sort of thing to happen (in this case Prof Geoffrey Petts of Westminster University), things started to happen.  In the last few years all five “BSc” degrees in homeopathy have closed and that is undoubtedly a consequence of the activities of bloggers and can assess evidence but who work more like investigative journalists. When the BCA released, 15 months after the event, its “plethora of evidence” a semi-organised effort by a group of bloggers produced, in less than 24 hours, thoroughly scholarly analyses of all of them (there is a &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/598"&gt;summary here&lt;/a&gt;).  As the editorial says, they didn’t amount to a hill of beans,  They also pointed out the evidence that was omitted by the BCA. The conventional press just followed the bloggers. I find it really rather beautiful that a group of people who have other jobs to do, spent a lot of time doing these analyses, unpaid, in their own time, simply to support Singh, because they believed it is the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Singh has analysed the data coolly in his book. But In the case that gave rise to the lawsuit he was writing in  a newspaper.  It was perfectly clear from the context what ‘bogus’ meant. but Mr Justice Eady (aided by a disastrous law) chose to ignore entirely the context and the question of truth. The description ‘bogus’. as used by Singh, seems to be entirely appropriate for a newspaper article.  To criticise him for using “unprofessional” language is inappropriate because we are not dealing with professionals. At the heart of the problem is the sort of stifling political correctness that has resulted in quacks being referred to as “professions” rather than fantasists and fraudsters [of course I use the word fraudster with no implication that it necessarily implies conscious lying].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least there are some laughs to be had from the whole sorry affair.  Prompted by that prince among lawyers known as &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/"&gt;Jack of Kent&lt;/a&gt; there was a new addition to my ‘&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=733"&gt;Patients’ Guide to Magic Medicine&lt;/a&gt;‘, as featured in the &lt;a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e2772e34-45a0-11de-b6c8-00144feabdc0.html"&gt;Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libel&lt;/strong&gt;: A very expensive remedy, to be used only when you have no evidence. Appeals to alternative practitioners because truth is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It is, perhaps, misplaced political correctness that lies at the heart of the problem.  Who can forget the &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=25"&gt;letter from Lord Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, while he was at the Department of Health, in which he described “psychic surgery” (one of the best known fraudulent conjuring tricks) as a “profession”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="follow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days later, the comment has &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/jul08_4/b2783#216788"&gt;appeared in the BMJ&lt;/a&gt; at last. But it has been altered a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

This comes after what I feel was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_still_use.php"&gt;latest PZ Myers’ complete demolishing of M&amp;amp;K’s position&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/unscientific-unscientific-america-part-1/"&gt;Jerry Coyne’s review of their book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so here are my thoughts right now on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard enough straw men, ad hominem attacks, false dichotomies, and other logical fallacies from Mooney in the past week than I can stomach. In my opinion, Mooney’s lost credibility. And for someone claiming to be a better communicator and advocating for a less confrontational approach, he’s not off to a good start. And I’m still waiting for a rational response to &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2841"&gt;Ophelia Benson’s questions&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t involve just calling her a militant or “New Atheist” and calling it a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe that Mooney et al have gotten so far with this particular criticism without backing up their very opening premise that being nicer equals being more persuasive with any evidence at all. What they’re doing seems to be taking their opinion of simply not liking the more aggressive approach and simply asserting that it’s not effective. There’s no research answering this one way or the other, though it seems to me quite apparent that those actively challenging religion have done far more for atheism and persuading people towards reason than their critics. For instance, I met a guy last night who credits Sam Harris for his apostasy. Further, I really think reports of Dawkins’ nastiness are GREATLY exaggerated and that to true believers, it’s impossible to politely disagree with them without causing offense. If they can’t present evidence, then this is just their opinion and they should not pretend it’s anything more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, I think M&amp;amp;K missed PZ Myers’ whole point of  the incident that’s been dubbed Crackergate.  His point wasn’t that a communion wafer is not literally transubstantiated in Jesus’ flesh. That part goes without saying. I think his point was that while the religious can tell their own sheep what is and isn’t sacred, the rest of us are under no orders to respect their beliefs in any way and that they have no right to threaten non-believers’ lives over their idiotic superstitions. At least that’s what I got out of the whole affair. I would be curious to know though if M&amp;amp;K even bothered in their book to mention the context, how Catholics like Bill Donohue organized to actively intimidate, bully, and threaten the life of the kid in Florida that started the whole incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then their’s M&amp;amp;K’s appreciation on their blog of this video of Neil DeGrasse Tyson questioning Richard Dawkins’ approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/why-i-think-honest-science-cannot-be-reconciled-with-religion-religion-is-largely-to-blame-for-science-illiteracy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/Dxff0k_TEzI/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while I love Neil Tyson to death, I find his “felt you more than I heard you” complaint rather vague. What does that really mean anyway? Dawkins is not at all the “angry”, “militant”, “evangelical”, “bigot” he’s accused of if one simply reads what he says or listens to him speak. Dawkins, like everyone else, doesn’t have the magical power to turn off his readers’/listeners’ personal biases/expectations and control how they choose to interpret or misinterpret his message. All he’s got is the ability to carefully choose the words that he uses the best he can. If people read more into what he says than is actually on the page, that’s not his fault. I’ve yet to ever hear Richard Dawkins lose his temper or show anything other than the appropriate level of respect to those he speaks to. And that includes what he says in &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; and in the many, many videos I’ve seen of him speaking at public lectures and in the Q&amp;amp;As.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while M&amp;amp;K are quick to celebrate Carl Sagan, I fail to see how Sagan’s approach was any less critical of religion than Dawkins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/why-i-think-honest-science-cannot-be-reconciled-with-religion-religion-is-largely-to-blame-for-science-illiteracy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/X0LLaph04Yw/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/why-i-think-honest-science-cannot-be-reconciled-with-religion-religion-is-largely-to-blame-for-science-illiteracy/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/4E-_DdX8Ke0/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is though that the reason I side with the Myers side (though not dogmatically, as I’ve been accused) is that, again, science is more than just a body of knowledge but a process for determining reality. If you’re willing to just accept fairytales as reality for no good reason and you’re not only comfortable with that but comfortable promoting that kind of thinking as a viable means of determining truth, then I’d say that is undermining the very foundation of science. And if you’re willing to accept one form of irrational belief system just because you happen to find it comforting, where do we draw the line? What meaningful difference is there between a creationist who says their inexplicable magical god MUST have caused the universe and someone like Francis Collins who says it’s merely his personal belief that his inexplicable magical god created the universe? We’re still left with, “god dunnit,” which has already been established to not be any kind of solution at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science works because it’s based on observation and there’s a whole process for weeding out nonsense. Faith is a competing system for determining truth, one that is not based on anything that is actually viable. If faith ever led to any truth at all, it’d just be because if you play the same lottery numbers enough, they’re bound to hit some sort of wins occasionally by sheer statistical probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now why is this debate important in the first place? I think Carl Sagan said it best in his book, &lt;em&gt;The Demon-Haunted World&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We’ve arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Jim and I met with our school district yesterday at an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/summertime_iep_time"&gt;IEP meeting&lt;/a&gt; that the district had requested. The school district is of the opinion that Charlie needs to be educated in a placement other than in the public schools (he is currently in a self-contained autism classroom in our town's middle school). There are some private autism schools here in New Jersey that are possibilities (and I am actually visiting one this very morning), but these schools are very small and, when we mention them as placements that we would like to inquire about for Charlie, the response is usually statements such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"getting into X school is harder than getting into Harvard"&lt;br&gt;
"Charlie will never get in because they only take 3 to 4 year olds and he is too old"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return to the IEP meeting (whose overall tone was on a similar note, as you may imagine). The private schools, including the one I am visiting and another I will visit tomorrow, have a one-to-one ratio of teachers/therapists to students, as is the case in Charlie's current program. Noting how difficult it is to get a spot at one of these schools, the district has mentioned some other placements, including a center that is quite large; earlier this year, they had also mentioned &lt;a href="http://www.bancroftneurohealth.org/Children/child_lindens.htm"&gt;this residential placement&lt;/a&gt;. We have had many questions about these places concerning the training and supervision of the staff, the staff-to-child ratio, and the staff turnover rate. Suffice it to say that we have found answers to our questions, and that these answers have only served to make us raise our eyebrows more and to dig our heels in deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the meeting (which was originally scheduled in late June and cancelled and rescheduled by the district), I had requested to see Charlie's records under &lt;a href="http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html"&gt;FERPA&lt;/a&gt; (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act). This review made it clear that evaluations (neuropsychological, speech/language, OT) had not been done for Charlie in more than three years. Under &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov"&gt;IDEA&lt;/a&gt;, students with disabilities are to be &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/test.force.school.htm"&gt;evaluated&lt;/a&gt; at least every three years, and such evaluations are necessary to determine placement. What, therefore, was the district basing a change in Charlie's placement on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this, combined with the district talking about other placements, adds up to a situation that is &lt;i&gt;in-ter-est-ing&lt;/i&gt;, to say the least and more than familiar to Jim and me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have been on a search for a school for Charlie before, in 2005, when he was in a public school program in another town in New Jersey. We homeschooled Charlie for a brief period as his classroom was not appropriate, and then he was admitted at a small private autism school. He did well there, but the school closed in June of 2006 and, on finding that another town---the one where we now live---has an in-district autism program that had, on paper, what Charlie needed, we moved in with my in-laws (they had been residents of this town for over 30 years). We hoped---one always hopes---that this might be our final move, as there have been many in Charlie's young life: He was born in St. Louis, diagnosed with autism in St. Paul, and we moved back to Jim's native New Jersey in 2001 so Charlie could get the education he needed. Since being in our current town, Charlie has been in three different schools, with three different teachers, for the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it seems that we are on yet another stage of our odyssey to find a school, a place, for Charlie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on a road already well-traveled. So now we are getting ready to go knocking on the doors of schools and asking about a place for Charlie, and knowing that the answer, as noted above, may very well be---will very well be---"We're sorry, no room here: Charlie is too old." It's not just that people think of autism as &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_isnt_only_for_children"&gt;something only children have&lt;/a&gt;, and that people overlook the fact that autistic adults are adults, not "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autistic_adults_are_not_large_children"&gt;large children&lt;/a&gt;." Autistic children like my son who is all of 12 years old---not even a teenager---are too often written off as "too old" by the time they're, well, 3 or 4 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very easy to become bitter, angry, enraged, and launch into &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_once_and_former_warrior_mom"&gt;full warrior mom&lt;/a&gt; mode (how dare they!!?!?!!!; etc.). But what this latest situation (roadblock) on the search for the best education for Charlie has been making us think mostly about is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_hawaiian"&gt;Never, ever give up&lt;/a&gt;. Never give up on a child, on any individual, regardless of diagnosis or age.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What can communities do to fully embrace all of their members so that no one, no one, gets written off? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do so that the message is not "he's out"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we do differently to make things work for a student like Charlie? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we change about we're doing, about ourselves? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not being done in our schools and our communities that students are sent out---warehoused even---that a school district gives up on one its own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still such a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/still_a_long_way_to_go_with_idea"&gt;long way to go with IDEA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing for sure as we step back on the road again. While once Jim and I had to hold Charlie's hands tightly to help him keep pace with us, now he (he is a 12-year-old boy, &lt;i&gt;puh-leez&lt;/i&gt;) shakes off our hands and clomps along beside us and, too, behind us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, too, ahead of us, leading &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;our tight team of three&lt;/a&gt; over the rocks and very careful around the ditches, the puddles and the mud.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247641088602"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3792">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/637fb7b23d367fd2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">YouTube atheist HealthyAddict converts to Plaitanism</title><published>2009-07-15T06:47:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T06:47:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/youtube-atheist-healthyaddict-converts-to-plaitanism/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/youtube-atheist-healthyaddict-converts-to-plaitanism/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/mn9-wcheTl4/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There is, however, a parallel, but less known, line of investigation into our ability to deliberately forget. This is no mere academic curiosity. The ability to forget selectively that to which we've been exposed would be, if we had it, an extremely useful ability - a kind of refuse collection service for the mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one of the first studies of its kind, &lt;a href="http://www.uncg.edu/~p_delane/"&gt;Peter Delaney&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues have now shown that people are indeed capable of reading a series of sentences and then selectively forgetting just some of those sentences, whilst remembering the rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dozens of undergrad students were first told to memorise an initial list of 16 sentences about the imaginary men, Tom and Alex. Afterwards, half the students were unexpectedly told to forget the Tom sentences, so as to better remember the Alex sentences. The remaining students acted as controls and didn't receive this additional instruction. Finally, all the students attempted to memorise a second list of 14 random sentences about another man, Joe. A 90-second multiplication test acted as a filler task before the students were tested on their ability to recall as many sentences as possible from the two lists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key finding was that the students were able to follow the forget instruction so long as the sentences about Tom and Alex were of random meaning, with no discernible theme. In this case, students told to forget the Tom sentences subsequently recalled just 28 per cent of them, in a two-minute free recall test, whereas the control students recalled 39 per cent. Moreover, there was also a non-significant trend for the students who deliberately forgot the Tom sentences to remember more Alex sentences (37 per cent) relative to the controls (32 per cent) - showing that their deliberate forgetting really had been selective for the Tom sentences. Memories of the second test list (sentences about Joe) were unaffected by the forget instruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another version of the experiment had the Tom and Alex sentences gradually forming discernible themes - Alex as a writer who liked snow sports and Tom as a lawyer and family man, or vice versa. Curiously, in this version, the students were not able to deliberately and selectively forget the Tom sentences. The researchers aren't sure why, but one possibility is that remembering just one sentence in a theme involuntarily cues all the other sentences, thus hampering attempts to forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So how do we deliberately forget a portion of previously-seen material. One possibility is that the forget instruction prompts people to cease mental rehearsal of to-be-forgotten items, in favour of extra rehearsal of the to-be-remembered items. Another possibility is that items are selectively inhibited at the retrieval stage.

I left TAM feeling socially drained and burnt out, and pretty depressed as a result (I'm not at my best among crowds of strangers, at least not as a peon), and while I'm quickly climbing my way out of that neurochemical funk and reinterpreting my memories as fun (isn't neurological plasticity great?), I want a few more days for everything to simmer so I can give the best report I can. Nobody wants to read a whiny report written in a moment of downitude, and I'm not going to give it to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For today, a short list:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- James Randi yelled at me and it was one of the highlights of my trip.&lt;br&gt;- Rebecca Watson got married live onstage with George Hrab supplying music and Adam Savage as the ring bearer. If only I was that cool.&lt;br&gt;- Penn Gilette is &lt;i&gt;fucking huge&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;- I have video of Teller speaking.

And there's 2 hours till the movie starts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus far, my girlfriernd and I are about the oldest ones in the theater. Not too many people dressing up, which makes me sad.

Any German was a target if they were found to be suffering from a range of perceived hereditary ailments, such as congenital mental deficiency, schizophrenia, manic-depressive insanity, epilepsy, Huntington's chorea, blindness, deafness, any severe hereditary deformity or even severe alcoholism.  Official pronouncements insisted that these individuals were a drain on the German people, both biologically and financially (see right).  The law passed on this day ultimately led to an estimated 400,000 people being involuntarily sterilized in pursuit of this national goal of "racial hygiene," to eliminate handicapped descendants.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists are fond of laying the blame for Nazi eugenics on Charles Darwin.  They insist that his materialist argument that humans evolved from animals and his conception of natural selection inspired the Nazis in implement a widespread policy of artificial selection within the Fatherland.  However, their claims are as baseless as was the so-called "science" that the Nazis employed.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/07/darwins_connection_to_nazi_eug.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/07/darwins_connection_to_nazi_eug.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

There are a lot of interesting perspectives out there, and I'd like to synthesize a few of the most important ones for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/science_what_is_it_really_all/writer.jpg" width="500" alt="writer.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Journalists:&lt;/b&gt; There are some excellent science writers and journalists out there.  (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_O%27Brien_(journalist)"&gt;Miles O'Brien&lt;/a&gt; was one of my favorites.)  There are also some horrendous ones, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bioephemera/2009/07/telegraph_blame_the_rape_victi.php"&gt;Jessica Palmer helped reveal&lt;/a&gt;, who I would go as far as to call &lt;a href="http://www.journalisted.com/richard-alleyne"&gt;sensationalistic, lying &lt;b&gt;frauds&lt;/b&gt;, like Richard Alleyne&lt;/a&gt;.  The huge problem with this is that the journalists are not necessarily scientifically competent, and are unable to distinguish between what's conclusive and inconclusive, what's valid and invalid, and what's forbidden and what's allowed.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, I recently read an article proclaiming that common activity X increased your chance of cancer Y by 150%.  Sounds horrifying!  Until you realize that there were 100,000 people in each trial.  Of the people who did activity X, &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; of them wound up with cancer Y.  Of the ones who didn't &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; got cancer Y.  &lt;b&gt;That is not scientifically significant&lt;/b&gt;, but the study was published anyway, and picked up by major news media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/science_what_is_it_really_all/htu739yc1q8euet6c12e9xsn1br06on.png" width="500" alt="htu739yc1q8euet6c12e9xsn1br06on.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Scientists:&lt;/b&gt; Why not go straight to the source?  Why not get the science directly from the scientists?  Well, in this month's Physics Today, Helen Quinn (a physicist whom I've met and respect deeply) writes as to why:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Science has tremendous patience for detail.  By examining the details, we learn the inadequacies of even our most successful theories and how we must change them.  Scientists eagerly seek the details that have not been tested and hope they will conflict with the best available theory because that provides an opportunity for new understanding to emerge.  Skeptical testing and retesting of ideas is central to the way science works.  Only when every possible detail has survived multiple tests can we say that a theory is well-established, and then only in the regime where the tests were passed.
&lt;br&gt;
Their passion for detail sometimes makes scientists' communication difficult for laypeople and students to follow.  Often, scientists present so much detailed information that even the most interested listener gets lost in it.  Although important to the progress of science, such details can overwhelm or bore the nonexpert.  In everyday life, insistence on the way every detail is to be understood is viewed as overly pedantic and generally irrelevant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The big problem with going straight to a scientist is that you are likely to get:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an explanation that uses jargon unfamiliar to non-scientists,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lack of context of the established theories, as scientists too often focus on the newest horizon,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a huge imbalance in what's really known, biased towards that particular scientist's favorite ideas, and, as Helen Quinn cautions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an overly pedantic and generally irrelevant explanation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
So if you can't go to a science journalist, and you can't go to a scientist, what's left?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/science_what_is_it_really_all/Sheril%20cracks%20us%20up.jpg" width="500" alt="Sheril cracks us up.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Science bloggers:&lt;/b&gt; As &lt;a href="http://www.astroengine.com/?p=5892"&gt;Ian O'Neill at AstroEngine&lt;/a&gt; writes, perhaps science bloggers can bridge this divide.  He makes some good arguments, but there's a problem with the crux of his argument.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most people don't read this.&lt;/b&gt;  Yes, I'd love to say that most Americans get their science news by going to science bloggers, but that's false.  The fact is, you, dear reader, represent far less than 1% of America.  You're already the educated ones.  You already understand that science is a process.  You already get that science has limits, and what those limits are.  You already understand -- again, to quote Helen Quinn -- what science does:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...scientists think of science both as a process for discovering properties of nature and as the resulting body of knowledge, whereas most people seem to think of science, or perhaps scientists, as an authority that provides some information -- just one more story among the many that they use to help make sense of their world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
At the end of the day, there are a lot of different avenues to take.  For me, the most important part of science is &lt;b&gt;that resulting body of knowledge&lt;/b&gt; that we've gained from all of the scientific investigations that have ever been done.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you believe, however you make sense of the world, you must be &lt;i&gt;consistent with what that scientific body of knowledge tells us&lt;/i&gt;, or you're just wrong.  If you know you're inconsistent with what that scientific knowledge tells us, then you're worse than wrong, &lt;b&gt;you are deliberately, willfully ignorant&lt;/b&gt;.  Everyone has their own approach to education, and mine is to simply tell you what we know and how we know it, in as straightforward, interesting, and unambiguous a way as I can come up with.  Maybe someday I'll have a bigger soapbox than this blog, but for right now, this is the best I can give you, and I can't really recommend anything other than your favorite science writers here at scienceblogs and in my blogroll.  As far as meeting the goals I set for myself, sometimes I do well, sometimes I do poorly, and sometimes I even make mistakes and get things wrong, but to increase your knowledge, interest, awareness and appreciation for what we know is always what I strive for.  (Sometimes with a bit of humor thrown in.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is knowledge, knowledge is power, and power is &lt;a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table5_6_a.html"&gt;less than 25 cents per kilowatt-hour&lt;/a&gt;.  You bring the interest and yourselves, and I'll keep bringing you as much as I can to help you make sense of the natural world.  And if I'm getting it wrong, for the love of knowledge, let me know!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/science_what_is_it_really_all.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247620092095"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13807">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3aa80c946009747d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Abortion"/><category term="General"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">The Empty Red Envelope Conspiracy Theory</title><published>2009-07-15T00:00:44Z</published><updated>2009-07-15T00:00:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/14/the-empty-red-envelope-conspiracy-theory/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, several pro-life individuals participated in a project called the &lt;a href="http://redenvelopecampaign.com/"&gt;Red Envelope Campaign&lt;/a&gt; in which they sent an empty, red envelope to President Obama at the White House.  There was a message on the back saying that the envelope represented an aborted baby.  This was supposed to get Obama to change his policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right… Obama reads &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/us/politics/20letters.html"&gt;ten letters a day&lt;/a&gt;, hand-picked for him.  I’m sure the empty envelopes just went into a separate, “special” pile before being discarded.  (Does Obama’s call to reduce the number of abortions means nothing to pro-lifers?  Yeah, I know… dumb question on my part.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one pro-lifer who participated in the Red Envelope Campaign just received a letter from the White House.  She expected at the very least a pre-written “thank you for your letter” response, a form letter of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mommyerin.blogspot.com/2009/07/not-sure-what-to-think.html"&gt;It turned out the envelope was empty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?!?!  The &lt;a href="http://www.americanpapist.com/2009/07/exclusive-is-white-house-mocking-pro.html"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; are beginning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, is this just some kind of mistake? Was there supposed to be a letter responding to my concerns about FOCA or my concerns about the genocide called abortion that remains legal in this country (and could become even more protected under the law as our current President seems to want it to be)? &lt;strong&gt;Or should I feel… mocked, perhaps?&lt;/strong&gt; After all, I did send them an empty envelope myself, representing one life lost to abortion, one life that was unable to have its voice heard by our elected officials in Washington. Getting an empty envelope in response… is that their way of saying, “No response — we don’t care. That life is still gone, and we remain silent on the matter.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or someone just made a mistake.  Is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you despised pro-lifers, which I don’t and I certainly don’t think the President does, why would you try to piss them off even more?  It’s certainly not the politically correct thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I suppose &lt;a href="http://www.americanpapist.com/2009/07/exclusive-is-white-house-mocking-pro.html"&gt;it’s more entertaining for them&lt;/a&gt; to think this was the White House’s way of not taking abortion seriously:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If some snarky intern did indeed think this would be a fun way to get back at pro-lifers, I think Chris and his wife are owed a second letter — an official apology.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oy.&lt;br&gt;

I’d like to make a few comments in regards to swearing and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why we swear; to express anger, surprise or pleasure; to shock, to emphasize, to show solidarity, or for humorous purposes. Similarly, there are many reasons why we don’t swear (socialization, belief system, inhibiting politeness factors, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possibly one of the most interesting types of swearing is the uncontrollable, compulsive kind…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stephens, et al. study tested “volunteers who cursed at will”, although most pain-response swearing is actually a reaction, rather than a deliberate attempt to ease pain. Personally, I’d like to beat the fuck out of some people and observe their auto-responses to pain, but try getting that one past your ethics committee…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screaming &lt;em&gt;shit!&lt;/em&gt; when you stub your toe or moaning &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt;! when you’re in the throes of passion are related to a phenomenon called &lt;strong&gt;coprolalia&lt;/strong&gt;; that is, the involuntary production of obscenities. This can be a characteristic of the condition known as Tourette’s Syndrome (although it’s really a rare symptom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/no-fucking-swearing-300x199.jpg" alt="no fucking swearing" width="240" height="159"&gt;Patients with Tourette’s Syndrome can exhibit muscular tics and/or vocal tics. These sudden, spasm-like tics are often involuntary outbursts of ‘bad language’. These include not only expletives but also abusive epithets and racial insults; and not only utterances, as some patients have the compulsion to write naughty words, make rude gestures (there are cases of deaf people with Tourette’s who sign rude words uncontrollably), and even produce offensive noises, such as belching. (Some readers must now be thinking, “Oh, Fuck! Do I have Tourette’s?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Tourette’s behaviors vary across cultures, and time. Patients seem to blurt out words that are deemed socially inappropriate in their time and place. It’s upsetting to think of historical sufferers who would have likely uttered profane or blasphemous words and been ostracized (or worse) for ‘demonic possession’ or ‘witchcraft’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that our vocabulary of obscenities is stored/accessed differently in the brain. It’s believed that taboo language is, ahem, &lt;a href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/sex-with-george-hrab/"&gt;rooted&lt;/a&gt; in our neural anatomy; inbuilt into the limbic systems of our brains. The cerebral cortex is to be thanked for our skepticism, reasoning, and rational thinking (that’s not to say we are always successful at this!). Conversely, the basal ganglia (the interconnected areas below the cerebral cortex) regulates emotions and behavior, like emotive swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, research has shown that &lt;a href="http://www.bad-language.com/tongues"&gt;glossolalia&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;speaking in tongues&lt;/em&gt; found in charismatic churches) shows an increase in use of the emotion centers of the brain during the event, and a decrease in the language parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/George-Carlin-refrains-from-uttering-the-7-dirty-words-300x150.jpg" alt="George Carlin refrains from uttering the 7 dirty words" width="300" height="150"&gt;Various studies (see below) implicate the basal ganglia in Tourette’s Syndrome (and similar neurological disorders such as asphasia). You see, the basal ganglia plays a large role in impulse control. Swearing can be a release of anger or stress, an act of aggression, a loss of control, or an &lt;em&gt;uninhibited&lt;/em&gt; reaction to pain. The swearing exhibited by Tourette’s Syndrome sufferers seems to &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; be uninhibited; a breakdown of the brain’s inhibitory mechanisms. Coprolalia appears to be a failure to inhibit some kinds of ‘normal’ behavior. Coprolaliacs can’t seem to refrain from engaging in ‘bad behavior’ in supposedly polite company. In a sense, it’s like giggling at a funeral…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of swearing is a fascinating and controversial area of cognitive science; we just don’t fucking know everything about it yet!&lt;/p&gt;

According to the news summary (the report is subscription only):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the 300-plus children's vitamins and prenatal vitamins tested for lead, only four were found to be lead-free. Those include TwinLab Infant Care, Natrol Liquid Kid's Companion, NF Formulas Liquid Pediatric and After Baby Boost 2 (for lactating women). No multivitamins for adult women tested negative for lead, but the ones with the lowest concentrations include FemOne, Viactiv Multivitamin Milk Chocolate, Family Value Multivitamin/Multimineral for Woman, and MotherNature.com Women's Basic Multi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, since there are trace amounts of lead in nearly anything, it's hard to say what this report means.  Sciblings, do any of you have access to the actual report?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the market would be really effective in eliminating vitamins that contained high levels of lead, if only the information about contaminants were easily available and consumers could choose safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/07/vitamin_lead_all_natural_compo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/GM1G7dOgsOc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247614891337"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13800">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3c4299ee2eeb6f5c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Sports"/><title type="html">The Faith of Albert Pujols</title><published>2009-07-14T23:00:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T23:00:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/14/the-faith-of-albert-pujols/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you’re watching the baseball All-Star Game tonight, you’re bound to see &lt;strong&gt;Albert Pujols&lt;/strong&gt; get a great reception from the hometown St. Louis crowd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that happens, think about this &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-pujols071409&amp;amp;prov=yhoo&amp;amp;type=lgns"&gt;article about him&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Jeff Passan&lt;/strong&gt; that discusses Pujols’ Christian faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some background if you’re not familiar with the player:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
His [Pujols'] transcendence is undeniable, even in a steroids-pocked era that infected record books like a virus. Pujols is the only player alive who could flirt with a .400 batting average and 60 home runs. He may well win the first Triple Crown this season since Carl Yastrzemski more than 40 years ago. He will catch the first pitch from President Obama before the 80th All-Star Game at Busch Stadium on Tuesday, the sort of perquisite reserved for royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams drafted 401 players before St. Louis selected Pujols in 1999.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s the reason for all his success?  God, of course… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-pujols071409&amp;amp;prov=yhoo&amp;amp;type=lgns"&gt;look at the way Pujols puts it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“God tells me what I need to do,” Albert Pujols said, “and I go out and do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is a constant figure in Pujols’ life ever since his wife, Deidre, took him to church in 1998 when they started dating. He believes God introduced him to her, and &lt;strong&gt;he believes God let him slip to the 13th round to properly motivate him, and he believes God made it so that Bobby Bonilla pulled a hamstring in spring training in 2001&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing Pujols to play in his stead, win a job and jump start a career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;I don’t believe in all that science stuff&lt;/strong&gt;,” Pujols said. “I believe in Jesus Christ, who gave me the strength and power and talent to honor him. You can always try to figure it out and be scientific and look for success. Not me. It’s dedication, hard work, practice and God.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He forgets that it takes at least a subconscious grasp of physics to know when and where to hit the ball for the best possible swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what’s with the recent praise to God for being a lower draft selection?  &lt;strong&gt;DeJuan Blair&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/26/gods-role-in-the-nba-draft/"&gt;did it in the NBA&lt;/a&gt; last month.  Maybe their lower pick has something to do with their less-than-best skill and talent at the time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Pujols was drafted in the first round,  does anyone think he’d be cursing God for not giving him enough motivation to do better?  I’m going to say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Bobby Bonilla must have been &lt;em&gt;pissed off&lt;/em&gt; that God pulled his hamstring because He loved Pujols more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too bad Passan &lt;a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=jp-pujols071409&amp;amp;prov=yhoo&amp;amp;type=lgns"&gt;doesn’t question anything&lt;/a&gt; Pujols is saying here.  He doesn’t directly question Pujols’ beliefs, and he doesn’t rebut him with his own thoughts in the final article.  He’s a typical sports reporter, happy to get the interview, not willing to ask any tough questions.  That’s a lost opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

But there are many types of abuse, and one that's come up here before but never in its own post is financial abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Austin (TX), a woman who ran several group homes &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/07/austin-police-seek-caretaker-accused-of.html"&gt;has been accused&lt;/a&gt; of exploiting residents by opening up credit card accounts in their names and using those accounts to make her own purchases.  The woman, who has a list of prior convictions mostly for theft, is still at large.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has echoes of the &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/05/oregon-woman-gets-year-in-jail-for.html"&gt;woman who stole thousands&lt;/a&gt; from the people she "helped" with their finances, local to me (OR).  That woman was convicted and sentenced to a year in jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such things don't only happen to people who are unable to manage money independently either.  One of the panel speakers at the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_4_of_6_pas_social_skills_and_community"&gt;Megaconference personal care assistant session&lt;/a&gt; is completely capable of managing her own finances under typical circumstances.  But a PCA once feed her double medication until she became so disoriented that the PCA was able to extort literally all of her money.  The speaker ended up having to file for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do about this?  Especially for those of us who have no clue how to tell if finances are being managed properly or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A background check of the sort that any federally run service organization requires would have helped out with the woman in Austin.  But not with the woman in Oregon who had no prior crimes and worked for a reputable service organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can we do to protect ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247611919823"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_176.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3cd6df425c16d771</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS ONE</title><published>2009-07-14T23:37:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T23:37:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/cShadz5DYP4/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_176.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_176.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?month=7&amp;amp;day=15&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;field=date" title=""&gt;12 new articles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; today.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006262" title=""&gt;Reef Endemism, Host Specificity and Temporal Stability in Populations of Symbiotic Dinoflagellates from Two Ecologically Dominant Caribbean Corals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium forms symbioses with numerous protistan and invertebrate metazoan hosts. However, few data on symbiont genetic structure are available, hindering predictions of how these populations and their host associations will fair in the face of global climate change. Here, Symbiodinium population structure from two of the Caribbean's ecologically dominant scleractinian corals, Montastraea faveolata and M. annularis, was examined. Tagged colonies on Florida Keys and Bahamian (i.e., Exuma Cays) reefs were sampled from 2003-2005 and their Symbiodinium diversity assessed via internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA and three Symbiodinium Clade B-specific microsatellite loci. Generally, the majority of host individuals at a site harbored an identical Symbiodinium ITS2 "type" B1 microsatellite genotype. Notably, symbiont genotypes were largely reef endemic, suggesting a near absence of dispersal between populations. Relative to the Bahamas, sympatric M. faveolata and M. annularis in the Florida Keys harbored unique Symbiodinium populations, implying regional host specificity in these relationships. Furthermore, within-colony Symbiodinium population structure remained stable through time and environmental perturbation, including a prolonged bleaching event in 2005. Taken together, the population-level endemism, specificity and stability exhibited by Symbiodinium raises concerns about the long-term adaptive capacity and persistence of these symbioses in an uncertain future of climate change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006230" title=""&gt;Eyes Wide Shut: Amygdala Mediates Eyes-Closed Effect on Emotional Experience with Music&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The perceived emotional value of stimuli and, as a consequence the subjective emotional experience with them, can be affected by context-dependent styles of processing. Therefore, the investigation of the neural correlates of emotional experience requires accounting for such a variable, a matter of an experimental challenge. Closing the eyes affects the style of attending to auditory stimuli by modifying the perceptual relationship with the environment without changing the stimulus itself. In the current study, we used fMRI to characterize the neural mediators of such modification on the experience of emotionality in music. We assumed that closed eyes position will reveal interplay between different levels of neural processing of emotions. More specifically, we focused on the amygdala as a central node of the limbic system and on its co-activation with the Locus Ceruleus (LC) and Ventral Prefrontal Cortex (VPFC); regions involved in processing of, respectively, 'low', visceral-, and 'high', cognitive-related, values of emotional stimuli. Fifteen healthy subjects listened to negative and neutral music excerpts with eyes closed or open. As expected, behavioral results showed that closing the eyes while listening to emotional music resulted in enhanced rating of emotionality, specifically of negative music. In correspondence, fMRI results showed greater activation in the amygdala when subjects listened to the emotional music with eyes closed relative to eyes open. More so, by using voxel-based correlation and a dynamic causal model analyses we demonstrated that increased amygdala activation to negative music with eyes closed led to increased activations in the LC and VPFC. This finding supports a system-based model of perceived emotionality in which the amygdala has a central role in mediating the effect of context-based processing style by recruiting neural operations involved in both visceral (i.e. 'low') and cognitive (i.e. 'high') related processes of emotions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006223" title=""&gt;Contrasting Role of Octopamine in Appetitive and Aversive Learning in the Crab Chasmagnathus&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Biogenic amines are implicated in reinforcing associative learning. Octopamine (OA) is considered the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline and several studies in insects converge on the idea that OA mediates the reward in appetitive conditioning. However, it is possible to assume that OA could have a different role in an aversive conditioning. Here we pharmacologically studied the participation of OA in two learning processes in the crab Chasmagnathus granulatus, one appetitive and one aversive. It is shown that the aversive memory is impaired by an OA injection applied immediately or 30 minutes after the last training trial. By contrast, the appetitive memory is blocked by OA antagonists epinastine and mianserine, but enhanced by OA when injected together with the supply of a minimum amount of reinforcement. Finally, double-learning experiments in which crabs are given the aversive and the appetitive learning either successively or simultaneously allow us to study the interaction between both types of learning and analyze the presumed action of OA. We found that the appetitive training offered immediately, but not one hour, after an aversive training has an amnesic effect on the aversive memory, mimicking the effect and the kinetic of an OA injection. Our results demonstrate that the role of OA is divergent in two memory processes of opposite signs: on the one hand it would mediate the reinforcement in appetitive learning, and on the other hand it has a deleterious effect over aversive memory consolidation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(P.S. It’s not that someone’s pregnant, so don’t sweat that.  Well, I mean, &lt;em&gt;someone, somewhere&lt;/em&gt; is pregnant, but that’s not the news I speak of… I’m getting confused.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a little tired today, and about to go sit on the couch and watch movies for the rest of the day.  I worked really hard these last few weeks to make TAM a success, and help Rebecca &amp;amp; Sid take that exciting next step in their lives, and squeeze in having as much of THE BEST TAM EVAR that I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my question(s) today have to do with gratitude and looking forward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&lt;strong&gt; Can you suggest appropriately rad phrases to indicate how made of awesome and mighty and win it was to meet and love on my fellow Skepchicks?&lt;/strong&gt; I’m having trouble finding the right words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Who would you like to see at TAM8 and beyond?&lt;/strong&gt; (No promises we’ll get them, but I know a girl at the JREF, I could pass along the good word.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afternoon Inquisition (or AI) is a question posed to you, the Skepchick community.

It's another ho-hum effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He claims he did spend some effort criticizing the overt anti-science forces in our country — only it was in his previous book, not this one. No, that doesn&amp;#39;t rebut me at all: in a book that purports to be discussing problems and solutions to the science and society divide, there ought to be some effort made to prioritizing the issues, even if it means revisiting points made in other books. Unfortunately, the message here is that we have three problems: the bumbling scientists who don&amp;#39;t know how to communicate, and the malicious atheists, who are hurting the cause of science education, and the sell-out media. You don&amp;#39;t just get to pretend that your readers have all read your other books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then compounds the problem by answering my accusation that he did not deal with the root causes of the problem by simply saying &amp;quot;did too&amp;quot;. Maybe he doesn&amp;#39;t think religion is as serious a problem as I do…but judging this book by its content, he apparently doesn&amp;#39;t think it has &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; to do with the unusual American disregard for science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further handwaving ensues in his defense of the media. Apparently, his own words that label factual accuracy as &amp;quot;mere&amp;quot;, is taken out of context — which he justifies by pointing out a comment by Dawkins that the natural world is fascinating, and doesn&amp;#39;t need human drama. As I said before, accuracy is not the enemy of drama, so this is a silly and pointless argument. Sure, make fun, entertaining, exciting movies. They just don&amp;#39;t need to be imbecilic to be good.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ah, but the real kicker here, the one that clearly is annoying Mooney most, is my accusation of uselessness against his book, that it offers no solutions at all. He says there are, there are! He says it several times, in several ways!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are solutions in each chapter of the main body of the book, broken down by sector-politics, media, entertainment, religion. And then there is the grand solution in Chapter 10-which emerged from our collaboration, and which we don't think either of us would have come up with on our own. So far as we know, it really is new in its particular way of analyzing the academic pipeline and finding, in it, a solution to our problems at the science-society interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, if you read his rebuttal, he won&amp;#39;t actually tell you what those solutions, or even that Grand Solution, are. It&amp;#39;s very strange; it&amp;#39;s as if he&amp;#39;s afraid that if he even briefly summarizes what his proposals are, you won&amp;#39;t need to buy his book, so they&amp;#39;ve got to be kept secret. His book is apparently like an M. Night Shyamalan movie — if you&amp;#39;re told what the little twist is before you go to see it, all you&amp;#39;ve got left is a rather slow moving, boring story that is plodding tediously towards the big reveal. Come on, grow up. If it&amp;#39;s a substantial idea, it&amp;#39;s the explanation and the details that make your book worth reading, not the one-liner gloss on your solution. You can give it away, it really won&amp;#39;t hurt your book sales. And if it does, that suggests right there that you aren&amp;#39;t offering much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm going to do it. I'm going to spill the beans. I am going to give you the Grand Solution that Mooney and Kirshenbaum present in chapter 10, the one that is so new that neither of them could have come up with it on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is. Ready?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's a summary of chapter 10: seven pages laying out the many problems that face people who want to pursue a career in science, from uninspiring teachers in grade school to the fierce competition for university positions. All true, of course, nothing at all novel here. What is their solution, presented in the final three pages? Create more well-rounded scientists, more Renaissance scientists, more scientists with specific training in communications skills, so that when they don't manage to land that academic position, they're still prepared to go out into society and act as ambassadors for science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, that's it. All of it. That's their solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How &lt;i&gt;nice&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm all for it. I teach at a &lt;a href="http://www.morris.umn.edu/"&gt;small liberal arts college&lt;/a&gt;, and there's absolutely nothing new at all in the sentiment expressed by Mooney and Kirshenbaum. It's actually something of a letdown and rather dismaying that they think it "really is new in its particular way of analyzing the academic pipeline". Excuse me for being thoroughly un-dazzled, but I think they could have talked to any of a few hundred thousand academics and they would have told them the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's also a little insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, the majority of my cohort that entered graduate school with me are not currently employed in academic positions. Mooney and Kirshenbaum know this, they outlined the general state of affairs in the first 7/10ths of this chapter. Yet, somehow, they aren&amp;#39;t sitting around panhandling for Thunderbird money down at the bus station — they are gainfully employed, and they are &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; smart, well-educated people with considerable depth and breadth to their knowledge and marketable skills, and no, none of them (as far as I know) are now anti-science cranks out there fighting the system. They already &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; ambassadors for science in our culture. They vote for pro-science candidates, they support public schools, and some of them even have jobs in government, industry, and communications where they are working in their own way to better the country…and many of them are certainly more effective at what they do than I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very strange. Mooney and Kirshenbaum say their "solution" will "alleviate pressure by opening new pathways for pent-up scientific talent to filter out into society." I had no idea that post-docs and graduate students who left the academic track were "pent-up" somewhere! I do hope someone lets them out of their cage soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there really is a problem, that all of you readers who have gone through grad school know. There is a lot of social pressure that is piled up on you to reinforce the notion of a hierarchy of science careers. The very topmost rung is the research professor at a Research I university, getting big grants and running a big lab with a team of grad students and post-docs; anything less is regarded as something of a failure. It can make it very hard to move on to something like these Renaissance jobs Mooney and Kirshenbaum want to promote. You can also see that same attitude resounding throughout the comment threads on their own site, where being, for instance, a teaching professor at a small liberal arts college or, oh no, a mere &lt;i&gt;popularizer&lt;/i&gt; of science are the marks of a lesser being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it would be absolutely wonderful if science students could also value the noble profession of teaching, or think that communicating well was a most excellent and useful skill that they could acquire by writing and speaking throughout graduate school. Or if they felt empowered to use their knowledge for public outreach in film-making, or in working as an activist for environmental causes, or finding a job in the pharmaceutical industry that would help establish new medicines. I know I felt that way, as did enough of my peers who went on to such professions. However, nothing in their book explains &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to make such an attitude occur more frequently, or even why we should expect a major change in the culture if something that is already happening, Ph.D. students finding work outside of academia narrowly defined, should continue to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, bottom line, still useless. The fact that Mooney seems so determined to hide his Grand Solution from public attention testifies to the fact that he's offering some mighty thin gruel in his book.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, but I should mention where Mooney shines, just to be fair. He's written a rather shallow book with negligible substance, but he has managed to get articles in Salon that tells us we need to &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/07/13/science_illiteracy/"&gt;"figure out where the real blocks to accepting science are"&lt;/a&gt; (but fails to tell us what they are) and another in Newsweek that claims that &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/206609/output/print"&gt;atheists are "hurting their own cause"&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps self-promotion ought to be high on the list of their proposed Renaissance curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not usually the case that I write a blog post for a carnival.  I usually just write for the blog, then now and then sit down and figure out which posts should go to with carnivals.  That is not the case with this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I thought, while writing a Peer Reviewed Research post, that it would be interesting to write up older papers, classics, or more recent papers that were of great interest for one reason or another but maybe a few years old.  Just around that time, this idea of a classic carnival ... a carnival of classic science papers ... came around (details &lt;a href="http://ontheshouldersofgiants.wordpress.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://hehttp://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/06/new_carnival_the_giants_should.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and I thought that was a very cool idea.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a plan to write a couple of different series of posts, one with Bob Trivers' papers (see &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2007/11/whitey_bulger_and_the_evolutio.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for a taste), which will come along very easily, as I have taught a course based primarily on his work. Another would be on papers regarding Race and Racism.  Again, this would draw heavily on my course on Race and Gender.  A third stream of posts may come from the Bioanthropology tutorial I taught at Harvard.  That was some years ago, so even the 'current' papers from that effort may now be classics (Tim Caro's work with hyenas springs instantly to mind).  Thinking about that approach led me to consider the first paper I usually assigned in that tutorial, and in fact, 'the' first paper in the field of evolutionary biology (perhaps, depending on your perspective).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That paper, I thought, is what this post should be about.  Darwin and Wallace's first composite paper on Natural Selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only question remains:  How many other people are going to do the same thing?  Probably scads of them.  So, I'll have to make this a little different.....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/darwin_and_wallace_1858.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/darwin_and_wallace_1858.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/ETKkOYrRho4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247610368229"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8160">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ce29f13cc9495a00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">To Live and Kick Ass in Austin?</title><published>2009-07-14T21:45:34Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T21:45:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8160" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, &lt;em&gt;Skepchick &lt;/em&gt;readers, I have had enough. I’ve reached the end of my golden rope of tolerance and optimism, and have fallen past the branches of mere cynicism and frustration, landing with a thud on a hard patch of pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You all know I followed closely and blogged about the Texas State Board of Education’s moronic refusal to listen to biology professors and an expert panel of scientists when adopting the science standards for Texas school children, leaving the door open for creationist bullshit to slip into the education materials. Well, water-head former State Board chairman, Don McLeroy, and his over-Jesused fucktard buddies on the board are now &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124753078523935615.html"&gt;pushing to load&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;history&lt;/em&gt; curriculum with several extra helpings of Christian delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conservative reviewers [of the history curriculum] say they believe that children must learn that America’s founding principles are biblical. For instance, they say the separation of powers set forth in the Constitution stems from a scriptural understanding of man’s fall and inherent sinfulness, or “radical depravity,” which means he can be governed only by an intricate system of checks and balances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks, I can’t take it any more. Despite my checkered past, despite the fact that it would be nearly impossible for a man of questionable character such as me to get elected, despite the fact that most Texans will want to draw and quarter me when they discover I don’t believe in any deities, I’m going to have to run for a seat on the Texas State Board of Education. Someone has to be the person at the board meetings who stands up and says, “Are you fucking kidding me?”. And I’m goddamn ready to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in regard to the article (by the way, big hat tip to &lt;em&gt;Skepchick &lt;/em&gt;reader, kevin, for alerting us to it), I realize that history is a very different kind of discipline than science. Unlike science, much of history is open to interpretation, and even many of us here are guilty of incorrect interpretations of it from time to time. For example, the United States DID NOT WIN THE SPACE RACE of the Cold War era, though many American adults think otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once again, the conservative board members are ignoring much of what the history experts are telling them, and instead are listening to their own hand-picked advisers. And among those hand-picked history advisers is the Rev. Peter Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Peter Marshall? &lt;em&gt;Reverend&lt;/em&gt;???? (And no, he’s not the former host of &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Squares&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an all-out moral and spiritual civil war for the soul of America, and the record of American history is right at the heart of it,” said Rev. Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does that sound like something an expert on history would say? Hell, does that sound like something anyone who wears big boy pants would say? I mean, come on. There’s no “soul of America”. There hasn’t been a soul of America since Ray Charles died. And what the hell is a “moral and spiritual civil war”? Isn’t that an oxymoron double word score or something? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, of course it’s not. It’s simply the language of a man who has no idea about what goes on in the world outside his church. And &lt;em&gt;he’s&lt;/em&gt; advising the board on how our children should be educated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem here runs even deeper than the good reverend’s naive worldview. Two of the advisers picked by the creationist cabal want to remove or de-emphasize references to several historical figures who have become liberal icons, such as César Chávez and Thurgood Marshall (no relation to the reverend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this in particular  is not an interpretive issue. It’s not even a factual issue. It’s a blatant political issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people are historical figures who had huge impacts on the progress of the human race. You can’t remove them from history books because they had different political philosophies than you, or because they have come to be associated with people who have different political philosophies than you. Where would such a process ultimately lead? Who the hell would be left in the textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids in a state already struggling with poor academic performance records would know even less. And as always, that is precisely the biggest worry in all this. I mean, we all know better. We keep asking questions and checking multiple sources from as many viewpoints as possible. The school children coming up in the fog of the current State Board may not be able to ever see through it, if it keeps getting thicker and thicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“America is a special place and we need to be sure we communicate that to our children,” said McLeroy. “The foundational principles of our country are very biblical…. That needs to come out in the textbooks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some level, the irony that men like McLeroy, while setting history guidelines, demonstrate such a profound lack of historical knowledge is delicious. Unfortunately, the stupid burns the tongue, leaving me to wretch at the sour taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, as always, there is opposition to the creationist cabal. The emphasis on Christianity as a driving force is disputed by some historians and guideline reviewers, who focus instead on the economic motivation of many colonists and the fractured views of religion among the Founding Fathers. You know, factual things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There appears to me too much politics in some of this,” said Lybeth Hodges, a professor of history at Texas Woman’s University and another of the curriculum reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some outside observers argue that curriculum analysts should be trained academics. “It’s important to have trained historians establishing the framework,” said David Vigilante, associate director of the National Center for History in the Schools at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, let’s hope those rational voices are heard and their ideas passed along to Texas school children and students across the US.&lt;/p&gt;

Around one sixth of all exoplanets currently known can be observed transiting their star's disk. Given that transits are precisely what &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/main/index.html"&gt;NASA's Kepler mission&lt;/a&gt; is going to spend the next three years looking for, that number is certainly set to increase over the coming months.

I confess: I've been wanting to give this title to a post for awhile but the, ahem, unintended pun(s)/associations have deterred me. But then I read about a study entitled "Does Size Matter in Australia?" in the July 13th &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090710092226.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taller men are able to earn more money than their shorter counterparts simply because taller people are perceived to be more intelligent and powerful, this according to a study published in &lt;a href="http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0013-0249"&gt;The Economic Record&lt;/a&gt; by Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study entitled "Does Size Matter in Australia?" uses newly available data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to estimate the relationship between hourly wages and two aspects of body size: height and BMI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It finds that taller people, particularly men, earn more money - with every five centimetres of height being worth about $950 per annum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the average man (178 centimeters; approx. 70 inches) were to gain "an additional five centimeters [just under two inches] in height, "he would be able to earn an extra $950 per year," according to study co-author Andrew Leigh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie, at 5 feet 6 inches (= 66 inches) is just about "average" (in Australia). So if he were to grow about six more inches (and be six feet tall), he'd make that "extra $950 per year"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things being as they are, I rather suspect not. Charlie's height (six inches of which he acquired in the past several months, starting in October of 2008) has made things more difficult for him rather than less. I'm 5 feet tall and still (true confession #2 in this post) get mistaken for a student. People see me jumping to retrieve an item from a top shelf and hasten over to get it for me. People see Charlie walking down the sidewalk and (is it my imagining? no, it is real) draw back. He's a bit bow-legged and (thanks largely to long bike rides like yesterday's 12-miler with Jim) he's got the muscles to show for his efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if he were small and slight? And people thought he was his actual age or younger, rather than 15 (Charlie turned 12 in May). And when they hear Charlie's speech, which is not what is "expected" of a person his size, something like a frown, a sort of look of puzzlement, of consternation, passes over their faces. I hate to say it: They are fearful because of his size and because of who they perceive Charlie to be, and what they think he might do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/looking_at_appearances"&gt;appearances shouldn't determine&lt;/a&gt; what people think. Of course they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Size really does matter and it's not necessarily, as the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090710092226.htm"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests, for the better. The one they call Mr. Big doesn't get called that for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

Granted, it's not a whopping huge majority (only 60%) but at least there's more people out there that realize this than don't. Why? The poll shows the majority of people think that scientific funding pays off in the long run. As can probably be expected, Democrats felt this more strongly (80%) than Republicans (68%).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another somewhat surprising finding was that the most knowledgeable demographic was the 30-49 age bracket. Out of 12 questions, this bracket averaged 8.5 correct; A full question better than my own demographic (18-29) and notably better than the 50-64 bracket which only got 7.8 questions right on average. Was there something better about that group's education? Or is this just a demographic that tends to &lt;i&gt;stay&lt;/i&gt; better informed? Amusingly, the only question my age group &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; do the best on was the “which of the following is no longer considered a planet?” question. I suspect it may have something to do with the “&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=2207893888"&gt;When I was your age, Pluto was a planet&lt;/a&gt;” Facebook group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One question I've never seen before on these polls asked scientists why they chose their career. I was pleased to see that 86% of scientists answered that solving intellectually challenging problems was very important to them. Only 4% said the money was important. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only does the general public not know about the science itself, but this poll also showed they were pretty deaf to the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/12/12/yes-bush-really-does-hate-science/"&gt;oppression of science under the Bush administration&lt;/a&gt;. More than half (55%) of scientists heard “a lot” about it, but only 10% of the public was aware. Among those that did hear, 77% of scientists felt it was true, compared to 28% of the public. As expected, 77% of scientists felt this occurred more frequently under Bush than other administrations while only 28% of the non-scientists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, what would a poll on science be without the evolution question: Among scientists, 87% say they “think that humans and other living things have evolved due to natural processes”. What about the other 13%? Sorry creationists. Almost all the rest are theistic evolutionsts. Only 2% actually believed humans were created in their present form (compared to 31% of the public). Happily, the younger generation seems to be more accepting of evolution. A total of 61% accept evolution (including theistic evolution). This falls about 5% per 20 year age group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disbelief in global warming, rejection of animal research and stem cells, fear of nuclear energy, and vaccines are also starkly highlighted as being far less supported by the general public than scientists. Fortunately, a strong majority (69%) of the public still feels vaccinations should be mandatory. I'd be curious to see if/how this has changed over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the public still remains positive about science, rating scientists as the #3 contributors to the well-being of society (behind the military and teachers). Humorously enough, that ranks us well above clergy and journalists (42% of those attending religious services say their clergy brought up science or scientific findings although the majority said that these references were neutral). As such, I find it very ironic that so many Americans &lt;i&gt;get&lt;/i&gt; their science from clergy members and journalists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what are scientists trying to do to fix this? Sadly, it looks like it's not much:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While 87% often to occasionally talk with non-scientists (which I presume could also include their spouses or friends) about science, other means are far less common. Only 3% of scientists talked with reporters often (20% occasionally) and 2% blogged (5% occasionally). I'd like to see an break down of the frequency on the journalists by age. I'm willing to bet younger scientists are more willing to talk to reporters but quickly become disillusioned by having their work mangled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, one of the things I found the most disappointed wasn't in the poll itself. It was in &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1553"&gt;the commentary&lt;/a&gt;. The commentator had this to say:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;respondents did far worse on more complex science questions. Only slightly more than half of all public respondents (54%) knew that antibiotics do not kill viruses along with bacteria, and fewer (46%) understood that electrons are smaller than atoms.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I was disappointed enough when a poll showed that nearly half of Americans didn't know how long it took the Earth to orbit the Sun and nearly 20% though the Sun orbited the Earth. Those are pretty basic questions. But then again, so is knowing the parts of an atom. It's not even &lt;i&gt;high school&lt;/i&gt; material. And here we have the CEO of the AAAS calling them &lt;i&gt;complex&lt;/i&gt;?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happened to our standards? If junior high material is can be considered "complex" it's no wonder we're doing so poorly.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-8602932164023308786?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247607060250"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BhaScienceGroup/~3/dxEkNemWt8g/prayer-reduces-stress-but-no-more-than.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/96a2f8d770c8b90a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Prayer reduces stress - but no more than self-motivation</title><published>2009-07-14T16:52:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T16:52:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/UAWbpt0nVu0/prayer-reduces-stress-but-no-more-than.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BhaScienceGroup/~3/dxEkNemWt8g/prayer-reduces-stress-but-no-more-than.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8sY9bx8acNM/SlzeO9tas1I/AAAAAAAAAb0/P4XU3au0SwA/s1600-h/Wilson_2009_prayer_stress.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:400px;height:260px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8sY9bx8acNM/SlzeO9tas1I/AAAAAAAAAb0/P4XU3au0SwA/s400/Wilson_2009_prayer_stress.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Prayer can reduce stress, according to a new study by Janie Wilson, a psychologist at Georgia Southern University. Not only do people who pray feel less stressed, but it also helps to lower their blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Wilson did was to subject a group of over 100 undergrads (90% of them religious) to a stressful task - she videotaped them while they did a four-minute mock interview.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before the interview, they each were given one of three different paragraphs to read. One was an encouraging prayer, one was an encouraging and motivational secular paragraph ("I can do this. Think of all the obstacles that I have overcome in my life..." etc). The third was the control group - they read about riding a bike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The graph shows the results from systolic blood pressure. As you can see, both self talk and prayer were pretty effective. Although prayer just wins out, the difference isn't statistically meaningful. Similar results were seen from the questionnaire-based measure of stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So these results show that prayer is about as effective as self-motivation. For Wilson, this was a surprise. She was expecting prayer to be more effective, on the grounds that it creates the mental feeling of a wider circle of friends - a bigger and more powerful support network, if you will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, it does help to explain why &lt;a href="http://bhascience.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-some-countries-are-more-religious.html"&gt;people pray more in stressful environments&lt;/a&gt;. To be sure, motivational self-awareness might be just as effective, but prayer is what they know and intuitively turn to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;_______________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="padding:5px;float:right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0pt none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Religion+and+Health&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1007%2Fs10943-009-9256-8&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Social+Buffering+by+God%3A+Prayer+and+Measures+of+Stress&amp;amp;rft.issn=0022-4197&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.springerlink.com%2Findex%2F10.1007%2Fs10943-009-9256-8&amp;amp;rft.au=Belding%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Howard%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=McGuire%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Schwartz%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Wilson%2C+J.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology%2CReligion"&gt;Belding, J., Howard, M., McGuire, A., Schwartz, A., &amp;amp; Wilson, J.

On my reading, the paper is an attempt to reconcile or integrate Rauschecker&amp;#39;s Dual Stream model, a &amp;#39;what&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;where&amp;#39; model, with the version of a Dual Stream model that we (Hickok &amp;amp; Poeppel, 2000, 2004, 2007) and others (e.g., Richard Wise, Sophie Scott, et al. 2001) have been promoting, namely a &amp;#39;what&amp;#39;/sensory-motor model.  There&amp;#39;s lots of good information and ideas in the paper (many of them previously elaborated) and it is good to see that Rauschecker is now agreeing with us that the dorsal stream supports sensory-motor integration.  However, the effort to reconcile/integrate the &amp;#39;where&amp;#39; and sensory-motor functions of the dorsal stream fall short in my view as do some of the more general claims by these authors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some of the claims made by R&amp;amp;S that I believe are not supported by existing evidence:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. "Speech perception and production are left-lateralized in the human brain" p. 720&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. "This expanded scheme [their model] closes the loop between speech perception and production and proposes a common computational structure for space processing and speech control in the postero-dorsal auditory stream" p. 722, figure caption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. "The postero-dorsal stream interfaces with premotor areas and pivots around inferior parietal cortex, where a quick sketch of sensory event information is compared with a predictive efference copy" p. 722, figure caption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. "The postero-medial planum temporale area ... is an &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;auditory&lt;/span&gt; area important in the act of articulation" p. 721. [emphasis added to indicate where the statement is incorrect]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So let's take these in turn, one post at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. "Speech perception and production are left-lateralized in the human brain"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I won&amp;#39;t argue with the claim that speech production is left-lateralized, but I will argue with the speech perception claim.  Evidence from chronic lesion, acute stroke, Wada, and split brain studies have shown that damage to the left hemisphere produces only relatively mild effects on the perception of speech sounds (see Hickok et al. 2008 &amp;amp; Rogalsky et al. 2008 for recent data and discussion). Here, for example, is the brain lesion in a recent case we (C. Rogalsky, T. Love, S. Andersen, H. Damasio, G. Hickok) had the opportunity to study (watch for our forthcoming paper which describes several cases).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CKwHFey8tic/SlzGYZ19X7I/AAAAAAAADHA/wgATYCGwDt0/s1600-h/lesion.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:400px;height:96px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_CKwHFey8tic/SlzGYZ19X7I/AAAAAAAADHA/wgATYCGwDt0/s400/lesion.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This patient performed at 100% accuracy in a four alternative forced choice (4AFC) word-to-picture matching comprehension test where all foils where phonological and at least one differed from the target by only one feature. Performance on a discrimination (same-different judgment) task involving pairs of words that differed by only one feature (e.g., goat-boat) was &amp;gt; 95% correct and non-word discrimination performed at 88% correct. This level of performance is not expected in a patient with no left superior temporal lobe given R&amp;amp;S&amp;#39;s claim for left-lateralization.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Nature+Neuroscience&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1038%2Fnn.2331&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Maps+and+streams+in+the+auditory+cortex%3A+nonhuman+primates+illuminate+human+speech+processing&amp;amp;rft.issn=1097-6256&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=12&amp;amp;rft.issue=6&amp;amp;rft.spage=718&amp;amp;rft.epage=724&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fdoifinder%2F10.1038%2Fnn.2331&amp;amp;rft.au=Rauschecker%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Scott%2C+S.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Neuroscience%2CCognitive+Neuroscience%2C+Cognitive+Psychology%2C+Linguistics"&gt;Rauschecker, J., &amp;amp; Scott, S.

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the case in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Last week, the House and the Senate passed resolutions directing the Architect of the Capitol to engrave “In God We Trust” and the Pledge of Allegiance in prominent places in the Capitol Visitor Center, which is “the entrance for the thousands of tourists who visit the Capitol every day.” The engraving project is expected to cost up to $150,000…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/news/2009/ayers.php"&gt;Freedom From Religion Foundation is now suing&lt;/a&gt; over this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Foundation Complaint said the Congressional appropriations “will give actual and apparent government endorsement and advancement of religion,” while excluding nonreligious Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“‘In God We Trust’ excludes and treats as outsiders the millions of adult Americans, including as many as 15% of all adults, who are not religious, i.e., atheists, agnostics, skeptics and freethinkers, none of whom possesses a belief in a god; the mandated language diminishes nonbelievers by making god-belief synonymous with citizenship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit seeks a judgment declaring the Congressional directive unconstitutional and an order enjoying [&lt;em&gt;sic... it should be "enjoining"&lt;/em&gt;] the defendant from engraving “In God We Trust” and the Pledge of Allegiance in the Capitol Visitor Center.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href="http://ffrf.org/legal/AyersComplaint.pdf"&gt;full complaint here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting why “In God We Trust” shouldn’t be engraved at the CVC.  FFRF provides plenty of reasons in their lawsuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“In God We Trust,” in fact, has not been a United States motto during most of this country’s history; America’s original motto was purely secular, i.e., “E Pluribus Unum” (”from many come one”), which motto was chosen by Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In God We Trust” was not recognized by Congress until 1956 and the motto did not appear upon paper currency until 1957.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the motto “In God We Trust” evidences no secular purpose; on the contrary, the motto was first adopted during the Cold War as a reaction to the purported “Godlessness” of Communism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In God We Trust” has no secular purpose; the phrase was adopted precisely to emphasize and endorse a supposed link between the United States federal government and Christian religious belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of “In God We Trust” is primarily and directly to endorse and promote religion, which endorsement would be unmistakably perceived by a reasonable observer familiar with the history and context of the phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In God We Trust” is intended to and does convey the message that the United States supposedly is a Christian nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Constitution, however, is not premised on a religious or Christian foundation; the Constitution was very purposefully and deliberately written without such a basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase “In God We Trust” ultimately was adopted as the result of a religious campaign during the McCarthy-era Congress, intended to create a symbolic unity of “God” with the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In God We Trust” excludes and treats as outsiders the millions of adult Americans, including as many as 15% of all adults, who are not religious, i.e., atheists, agnostics, skeptics and freethinkers, none of whom possess a belief in a god; the mandated language diminishes nonbelievers by making god-belief synonymous with citizenship.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to the Michael Newdow/Rob Sherman lawsuit?  I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don’t know whether FFRF will win this case.  They should, of course, but it doesn’t mean they will.  Losing the case may set further precedent that could hurt us in the future when there’s a more pressing issue.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, &lt;strong&gt;Bill O’Reilly&lt;/strong&gt; will probably publicize the lawsuit and FFRF will gain even more members, so there’s an upside either way!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The critics, though, have it exactly backward: the United States needs more scientists like Collins—researchers who show by their prominence and their example that a good scientist can still retain religious beliefs. The stunning irony in the longstanding tension between science and religion in America is that many scientists who merely claim to be defending rationality from religious fundamentalism may actually be turning Americans off to science, doing more harm to their cause than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and religion are not mutually exclusive and must not continue to be portrayed as such. Though some very vocal voices in the science community disagree, I assure you they are not representative of the whole. I continue to work day to day with scientists who hold a very broad array of beliefs across fields from molecular biology to physiology to conservation. And when it comes to issues like climate change and &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/blogs/2007/11/ocean-acidification.html#more"&gt;ocean acidification&lt;/a&gt;, everyone must be be engaged if we’re to get anywhere. The new atheist movement takes an adversarial approach, but only succeeds in alienating the majority of the planet away from science. When it comes to enacting sound policies on what really matters, this will always be a losing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans have serious problems with science, and religion is definitely part of the reason. But that doesn’t mean fighting religion, indiscriminately, is the answer. A far better approach is to work with religious believers to help them separate their personal religion from everybody’s shared science, and move toward a much needed middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Atheists will hardly be pleased by the Collins choice, but that’s unpreventable and perhaps even to the good: science and atheism aren’t the same, and the former must always remain a broader, more inclusive category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of it is expressed in right-wing radio talking points.  They quite literally believe that they will no longer be able to choose their doctor, or that other doom and gloom events are imminent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have they no experience with government?  Health care reform isn't going to happen quickly.  When it does, it will likely have an American character.  While socialized medicine works very well in some other countries, Americans just aren't into it, even if it were to work.  Whatever I may think about it, it's a non-starter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what should we really fear about health care reform?  The answer of course depends on your position and ideology.  I of course hope that something is done about reimbursement for primary care physicians, but that's one issue of many.  Leaving aside for a moment the cost containment elephant in the room, what ideologic fears might we have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely, given American culture, that any plan will significantly limit choice of primary care physicians.  Very few plans place significant limitations.  In fact, Medicare, the largest health plan (which is "socialized") places no limits on what doctor you can see.  There is  little reason to do so.  The closest idea to this would be doctor quality control.  If doctors are not practicing according to some (mythical) set of quality guidelines, they could be "punished" either financially, or by being cut from some (mythical) list.  If current trends hold, doctors who fail to follow evidence-based guidelines will be punished financially rather than having patients plucked away.  This has it's own pluses and minuses, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access is certainly a problem, but not in the way the fear-mongers would have you believe.  The largest problem with access is lack of insurance (either total or partial).  Some other less spoken of problems (which are actually being proposed) are conscience clauses, which would allow doctors to refuse to render certain care; limits on abortion; limits on birth control, and other "moral" issues.  The theocratic right knows health care reform is coming one way or the other, and they want in.  Since they might not get the economic concessions, they hope to insert their religious agenda, and anyone who thinks this will not affect them is fooling themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health care is an inconceivably large and complex system.  No single issue is likely to dominate the reform effort.  When educating yourself, try to avoid the hype, and look to the real issues.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/health_care_reform---what_me_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/7L7CUEZrOjQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247603801500"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/14/the-church-of-me/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e0b7c6ee9a962e2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">The Church of Me</title><published>2009-07-14T20:00:11Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T20:00:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/14/the-church-of-me/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It's been known for well over 200 years, but it never ceases to amaze me, as this video demonstrates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/iR9WVhiaIeY%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_mid.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;A three-dimensional hollow face mask held a few feet away will appear to be convex (turned "out" towards the viewer) no matter which side you look at (this image is from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/"&gt;Max-Planck-Institut für biologische Kybernetik in Tübingen&lt;/a&gt;). While the movie depicts a computer-generated model, the effect works just as well with a real physical mask. Scientists have attempted to explain the illusion for centuries, but there is still much we don't know about how it works. Our visual system can use tools like binocular disparity and motion parallax to judge distance, but these techniques don't seem to work with the hollow mask until we're extremely close to it: for many people, nearer than three feet. The effect is diminished if the mask is turned upside-down, but it doesn't disappear; nearly everyone still sees the illusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect isn't completely due to the direction of lighting either. While the visual system tends to assume light is coming from overhead, hollow masks lit from below still appear convex. Others have suggested that the illusion arises because we "know" that we're seeing a face, and that knowledge trumps other visual cues that suggest it's not convex like a real face would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is true, then the effect should be stronger for more familiar objects, and weaker for less familiar things. Harold Hill and Alan Johnston showed 12 volunteers three different hollow shapes: molds in the form of a teddy bear, a pineapple, and a "jelly mold" (Americans would call this a "jello mold"):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/07/some_insight_into_how_the_holl.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/2009/07/some_insight_into_how_the_holl.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/cognitivedaily/~4/YLyhlMKxsfE" height="1" width="1"&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

within which we are asking these questions, understanding what they mean, and judging the answers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It began with Plato, as mentioned above.  From his work we get the concept of the Platonic Ideal:  the perfect representation, the archetype, behind a concept represented by a word.  As he explained it, we are chained in a cave as it were, looking at the back wall, able to see only shadows cast by the ultimate, ideal, reality cast by the light of &amp;quot;Truth&amp;quot;, because we are unable to turn and look out the entrance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This paradigm was pretty much universal by &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic"&gt;Hellenistic&lt;/a&gt; times (a few centuries after Plato) in the west, and also, I suspect, in the east where it had spread via Persion/Greek influences to &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, and from there via  &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Buddhism"&gt;Chan/Zen Buddhism&lt;/a&gt; (and possibly other schools) across North Asia to China.  (My suspician is partly founded on the fact that Zen Koans seem well designed to break the tyranny of words/concepts as absolutes, forcing the seeker to recognize that these things are only limited tools, like a set of shelves which are fine for holding small solid objects, but limited for very large objects and useless for liquids.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reality, as &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_semantics#Points_of_contrast"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; is showing, is that our brains typically identify words &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristically"&gt;heuristically&lt;/a&gt;:  we learn of a number of items that belong to a class represented by a word, our minds (often subconsciously) identify common features or characteristics of these items, and we tentatively identify new members of the class based on those same shared features/characteristics. &lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Backing up again to Plato, we can see that there&amp;#39;s no reason that such classes require an &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; at all:  they are just groupings of items that are all similar enough to justify attaching a word, a symbol, to the class.  A concrete example may be helpful:  consider the word &amp;quot;&lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couch"&gt;couch&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.  This may be loosely defined as a bench with a back and armrests (at least in modern usage), long/wide enough for at least two people to sit comfortably.  Can we define a Platonically ideal couch?  Not without context.  For instance, to Victorians such a couch would have had a reasonably vertical back and stiff cushions, helping to support people who were expected to sit up with good posture while socially interacting.  But for modern laid-back music lovers, the ideal couch will be much more relaxed, allowing occupants to lean back and totally relax while losing themselves in musical reproductions not available even live to Victorians. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, the ideal, singular to Plato, splits into many depending on context, observer, and time.  The problem is that our thought patterns, our paradigms, are constrained by over two thousand years of Plato&amp;#39;s influence, and they often interfere with efforts to understand how language, symbols, and concepts work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&amp;#39;s certain that the human brain has a mechanism for representing words:  my best guess is that they&amp;#39;re normally represented (in at least one area of the brain) as abbreviated &amp;quot;shorthands&amp;quot; for the sequence of tongue, lip, mouth, throat, and &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm"&gt;diaphragm&lt;/a&gt; movements that go into pronouncing them.  But is this true of concepts?  Did recent human ancestors invent the concept, or the symbol that stands for it?  Are even our closest relatives lacking this feature? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think not.  We know that many primates possess &amp;quot;&lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neurons"&gt;mirror neurons&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramidal_cells"&gt;pyramidal cells&lt;/a&gt; in parts of the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex"&gt;neocortex&lt;/a&gt; that tend to fire in the same groups when the animal is performing (or preparing to perform) some action and when it&amp;#39;s observing some other animal performing that action.  I would say that actions of this sort represent concepts, and that the processes around the firing of these &amp;quot;mirror neurons&amp;quot; represent neurological symbols (or the use of them).  At a sufficiently abstract level, there&amp;#39;s no real difference between a specific pattern of lines on a piece of paper (or clay) and a specific pattern of neurons in the neocortex (or a specific pattern of sounds). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before we go farther, we need to examine how the mammalian neocortex operates.  I&amp;#39;m going to use Francis Crick&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.simonandschuster.net/content/book.cfm?tab=1&amp;amp;pid=404945&amp;amp;er=9780684801582"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Astonishing Hypothesis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a base, although it&amp;#39;s highly simplistic and probably wrong in some details.  As he does, I&amp;#39;m going to focus on the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex#Primary_visual_cortex_.28V1.29"&gt;V1 area in the visual cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which receives input from the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt; (via the &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_geniculate_nucleus"&gt;lateral geniculate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;: a part of the thalamus), performs a &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_transform"&gt;complex transformation&lt;/a&gt; on it, and sends the results on to further areas of the brain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The large majority of axons coming from the retina carry a single type of message:  each neuron is watching a specific location in the retina, looking for a specific type of spot against an opposite background:  some look for big spots, some for small.  Some for dark spots (against a light background), some for light.  some for red spots (against a presumably green background), some for blue, green, purple, etc.  Now all of these things these different neurons are looking for can be mapped onto an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-dimensional space:  in this case with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; probably equal to five:  two dimensions for the location within the retinal field, one for size, one for color, and one for light/dark.  The light/dark axis may be discrete rather than continuous; it may even be two-valued.  The color axis also may be somewhat more complex than my simple description makes it sound:  there are some complications regarding the distribution of cone types within the retina that time and space don&amp;#39;t permit discussing.  These points don&amp;#39;t affect the basic picture:  the visual field of the retina can be mapped as an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-dimensional space of &amp;quot;spots&amp;quot; with each neuron sampling a specific location in that space and responding accordingly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, most of the visual field isn&amp;#39;t made up of spots (although in the world of the earliest chordates it may well have been:  our evolutionary history is often built into our design in ways we wouldn&amp;#39;t suspect).  What each neuron in the retinal population I&amp;#39;m discussing does is look to see how much the visual input &lt;b&gt;resembles&lt;/b&gt; the type of spot it's looking for, and the more it does, the larger its firing rate (the faster it fires &lt;a title="Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potentials"&gt;action potentials&lt;/a&gt;).  Notice, then, that what we have here is a continuous function over a continuous space (disregarding complications involving a discrete light/dark axis) varying continuously over time, but sampled at discrete points in space and time.  Each neuron occupies a specific point in the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-space and samples that one point (although since it&amp;#39;s actually examining the vicinity looking for a spot, one close to its location would generate a partial signal).  Each neuron intermittently sends a signal with its instantaneous firing rate, thus the closer it is to seeing what it&amp;#39;s looking for, the more frequently its signal is b...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe in all that science stuff,” Pujols said. “I believe in Jesus Christ, who gave me the strength and power and talent to honor him. You can always try to figure it out and be scientific and look for success. Not me. It’s dedication, hard work, practice and God.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really?  No science stuff?  What about the observation that metal bats hit balls &lt;a href="http://paws.kettering.edu/~drussell/bats-new/alumwood.html"&gt;harder&lt;/a&gt; than wood ones?  (”That’s god.”)  The fact that stadiums at high elevations and in dry climates tend to have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field#Reputation_as_a_home_run-friendly_park"&gt;more home runs&lt;/a&gt;?  (”That’s god.”)  The fact that &lt;a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/baseball/curve.html"&gt;curveballs curve&lt;/a&gt;?  (”That’s god.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But surely his “loving” god wouldn’t injure another player in order to get Pujols on the field.  Would he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes God introduced him to [his wife], and he believes God let him slip to the 13th round to properly motivate him, and he believes God made it so that Bobby Bonilla pulled a hamstring in spring training in 2001, allowing Pujols to play in his stead, win a job and jump start a career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose now we’ll have to put an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterisk#Competitive_sports_and_games"&gt;asterisk&lt;/a&gt; on Pujols’s records, as I’m pretty sure that (for example) Hank Aaron didn’t have Jesus injuring other players on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247598974357"><id gr:original-id="http://uncdiss.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/keep-your-woman-happy-in-your-relationship-sex-her-up-frequently/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2e1fa42aca456bb7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Keep Your Woman Happy In Your Relationship, Sex Her Up Frequently</title><published>2009-07-14T14:13:27Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T14:13:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/xhUdZSBiaF8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://uncdiss.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/keep-your-woman-happy-in-your-relationship-sex-her-up-frequently/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">Yes another sex article (what can I say other than they’re fascinating and entertaining to read at the same time) but maybe not as risque as vibrator use.  PhD student Rui Miguel Costa and Professor Stuart Brody surveyed 30 Portuguese women (mean age 25.8, SD 5.33) to find out whether frequency of different sexual behaviors [...]&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=uncdiss.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=7182341&amp;amp;post=290&amp;amp;subd=uncdiss&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1"&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

As such we tend to automatically assume that apoptosis is a Bad Thing, but in reality apoptosis often is quite necessary for normal physiological function at the organism level.  In order for our bodies to maintain the homeostasis that defines so many of our cellular processes, we have to sacrifice some cells.  As it turns out, we actually wind up sacrificing enormous numbers of cells every day.  Worn out red blood cells, dangerously self-reactive lymphocytes, individual columnar epithelial cells and others.  These processes are tightly regulated, so much so that most cell types actually require biochemical signals from neighboring cells, tissues, or even distant organs just to tell them to keep living.  The anti-apoptotic survival signals can fall below a threshhold value and/or be overridden by pro-apoptotic stimuli, which normally results in swift induction of the apoptotic program.  When individual cells develop mutations that deafen them to these signals, they become dangerous proliferation-happy pre-cancerous cells more interested in their own survival than that of their constituent organism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Apoptosis_stained.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:485px;height:477px" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Apoptosis_stained.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Figure A: TUNEL histochemical staining in murine liver, brown cell is apoptotic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The apoptotic program ultimately results in highly oxidative and degradative enzymes (such as proteases) hidden away in the mitochondria being released into the cytoplasm to wreak havoc.  Usually the raw material of a dying cell is tidily absorbed by its neighbors to be recycled.  I've always imagined mitochondria as pulsing with a low, gentle buzz in normal cellular physiology with occassional metallic pings as statistical flucuations in the net free energy of electrons falling down the electron transport chain is captured in ATP.  Following this, I think the sound of caspase-8 et al slicing open the mitochondria would be like the initial panicked braking shriek of a train loaded with Furbies who are quickly drowned out in the self-amplifying roar like a tornado grinding through a gravel pit as the apoptotic effector enzymes set to work dissolving the cell from within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apoptosis is absolutely essential not just to adult homeostasis, but also to normal ontogeny.  Without apoptosis organs would fail to separate, fingers would remain stuck together, and many other things would go very, very wrong.  There are 2 families of intracellular proteins that battle to determine whether or not a cell will become apoptotic: the (generally) pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family and the (generally) anti-apoptotic IAP family.  Conveniently, IAP stands for Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein.  A recent review by Dr. O'Riordan et al discussed the diverse and essential roles for IAP proteins in normal tissue development across a wide range of model organisms.  From ablated organ development in the absence of Diap1 in Drosophila larvae to stunted hematopoeitic developmental repertoire in the abscence of Survivin in mice, IAPs seem to be evolutionarily conserved signal transducers that integrate diverse extracellular signals into a coherent cellular action.  Developmentally, the IAP proteins seem to be involved in everything from proper vascularization to chromosome stability, although it is important to note that direct modulation of apoptosis in developmental processes has only been established in invertebrates.  Lack of any one of several IAPs in higher chordates has not been directly linked to developmental apoptosis, but several abnormal embryonic phenotypes and attenuated adult functional capacities have been demonstrated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IAPs are grouped by the prescence of BIRs (baculovirus IAP repeats) and many also have RING domains.  Both motifs have been found to have zinc-finger conformations and the interaction of different sections of adjacent BIR motifs in some proteins, such as direct inhibition of pro-apoptotic caspases-3 and -7 by BIR2 of XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein), has been found to modulate a number of diverse effects.  These diverse effects are potentiated by the ubiquitin ligase activity that some RING domains have demonstrated.  IAPs help the organism balance necessary apoptosis and unnecessary apoptosis, and because apoptosis is required for the homeostasis of most tissues the IAP family has been evolutionarily conserved and biochemically diversified.  IAPs remain an active and engaging area of research that holds great promise in the treatment of pathologies from cancer to intracellular bacterial infections and underscore how a little sacrifice for the team by one cell can make a massive impact on the constituent organism's overall fitness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IAPs have also been found to modulate innate immunity, which will be discussed in another post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Developmental+Cell&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.devcel.2008.09.012&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Inhibitor+of+Apoptosis+Proteins+in+Eukaryotic+Evolution+and+Development%3A+A+Model+of+Thematic+Conservation&amp;amp;rft.issn=15345807&amp;amp;rft.date=2008&amp;amp;rft.volume=15&amp;amp;rft.issue=4&amp;amp;rft.spage=497&amp;amp;rft.epage=508&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580708003948&amp;amp;rft.au=ORIORDAN%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=BAULER%2C+L.&amp;amp;rft.au=SCOTT%2C+F.&amp;amp;rft.au=DUCKETT%2C+C.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CMolecular+Biology%2C+Microbiology%2C+Biotechnology%2C+Bioinformatics%2C+Cell+Biology%2C+Computational+Biology%2C+Immunology%2C+Systems+Biology"&gt;ORIORDAN, M., BAULER, L., SCOTT, F., &amp;amp; DUCKETT, C.

That’s about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government is the appropriate agent for certain forms of collective action: roads, public schools, national defense.  It’s also good for big-picture things without immediate financial payoff, like support for the arts or basic scientific research.  It makes perfect sense for the government to shoulder the burden for developing the technologies to get us into space, and it will continue to make sense for them to play an active role in astronomical research in space.  But for commercial purposes, like launching satellites, it ultimately makes a lot more sense for space travel to be a private-sector enterprise.  We’re on the brink of seeing it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; is a private company founded by Elon Musk, who previously co-founded PayPal and the electric car company &lt;a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/"&gt;Tesla Motors&lt;/a&gt;.  For a while now, SpaceX has been developing reusable launch vehicles and space capsules.  They’ve been awarded a contract from NASA to take over re-supplying the International Space Station after the Shuttle fleet is mothballed next year.  And they’ve had one launch that reached orbit, but also a few failures; until yesterday, they hadn’t succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2009/07/14/private-space-co-spacex-launches-its-first-commercial-satellite/"&gt;now they’ve done it&lt;/a&gt;.  I was watching on live webcam last night as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1_Flight_4"&gt;Falcon 1 rocket launched a Malaysian satellite into orbit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/WTFlFFrfEB0%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0x3a3a3a%26color2%3D0x999999%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=580&amp;amp;height=360" width="580" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly exciting, but just the beginning.  The idea behind the Shuttle was to make trips to orbit cheap, reliable, and routine; it failed spectacularly on all counts, and NASA’s capabilities and plans for space flight have become somewhat disjointed (while its science missions continue to have amazing success).  Hopefully we’re moving past the point where we have to rely on the government to get us to space.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247597456218"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/bastille_day_sprog_art.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c16a413d4581b379</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Critters"/><title type="html">Bastille Day sprog art.</title><published>2009-07-14T18:53:30Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T18:53:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/6WcnzqZ5HZU/bastille_day_sprog_art.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/bastille_day_sprog_art.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not that the art has anything to do with Bastille Day, but it seemed like as good an occasion as any to share some more of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

No one wants to cut services and at the same time, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/21/us/21calif.html"&gt;no one wants to pay taxes&lt;/a&gt;.  So what do you do?  Ticket ticket ticket!  And raise the fines for those tickets.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the years I've lived in California, I've never seen so much traffic enforcement.  They're radaring all over the highways.  And check this out--those fancy new parking meters are capable of neat tricks.  For instance, it's pretty easy to change the hours to 8 PM.  8 PM!  In Oakland.  Some ticket fines have more than doubled!  The linkage to the financial crisis is &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/14/BAAM18MKTA.DTL&amp;amp;tsp=1"&gt;explicit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oakland has raised the price of parking tickets, extended meter times to 8 p.m. in most parts of the city and is more aggressively enforcing parking violations, including in residential neighborhoods.

&lt;p&gt;The decision is driven by the city's budget woes, which deep cuts to city services alone did not solve. Falling sales and property, property transfer and hotel taxes have contributed to a $51 million decline in revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way or another, they're going to get this money out of us.  Would you rather just pay taxes or be nickled and dimed by the police?  Which, of course, raises a related issue...why limit your fee collection to speeding and parking fines?  Charging people for crimes, such as DUI, may be a money maker too...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/07/the_taxman_cometh_via_ticketin.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/wQNbzfb-Cs4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247594794194"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14789">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6920b10cb38dfd42</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Baseball"/><category term="Buster Olney"/><category term="Q&amp;A"/><title type="html">Bring Your Questions for Baseball Sage Buster Olney</title><published>2009-07-14T17:03:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T17:03:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/bring-your-questions-for-baseball-sage-buster-olney/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">If you care about baseball, you should care about &lt;strong&gt;Buster Olney&lt;/strong&gt;.

It’s a decent write-up of the situation; I’ve read about a million others just like it at this point so nothing really leaps out at me… except they quoted me in it! That was cool. Now the Fox network has two reasons to hate me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, there were a couple of things that made me smile (besides also quoting My Close Personal Friend Adam Savage™). They talked to one conspiracy theorist from Argentina:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… he said that the political corruption during the years of dictatorship in his country shaped his thinking: &amp;quot;I started to realize how political corruption operates and how it is the interests of a few in power that really governs our world.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, paranoid conspiracy thinking is a good thing to extrapolate from one venue to everything else in the world. [Insert rolleyes icon here if you will.] Look: that sort of thing is not a worldview; it’s an excuse. If you use it as a way to live your life, then &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is a conspiracy. The light turns red when you get to it? Zionists! It rains when you want to take a walk? Illuminati! Your cat pukes up hairballs after cleaning herself? Big Pharma!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other bit that made me smile was this from none other than Bart Sibrel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have suffered only persecution and financial loss,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I’ve lost visitation with my son. I’ve been expelled from churches. All because I believe the Moon landings are fraudulent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, poor, &lt;em&gt;poor&lt;/em&gt; Bart! After all, he’s such a noble man, hiding in the bushes to jump out at astronauts to make them swear on a Bible that they walked on the Moon, lying to get into their houses and accuse them of faking the landings, and harassing and intimidating Buzz Aldrin so much that the second man to walk on the Moon had to punch Sibrel to get him to back off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey Bart: it’s not your beliefs that open you to ridicule. It’s &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that the NYT article doesn’t go into any real detail on why the conspiracists believe such nonsense — except to dismiss them — which is fine. There are copious places where they’re enumerated, and they do link to my debunking of the hoax nonsense. So all in all, it’s a good read, but let me remind you — the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; news here is that it’s been 40 years since we sent humans to the Moon. Let’s concentrate on putting them back there once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Djordje Jeremic (yes, he is the son of &lt;a href="http://www.tanjasova.com/" title=""&gt;Tanja Sova&lt;/a&gt;), of the &lt;a href="http://paperdisciple.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Paper Disciple's Blog&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? Where are you from? What is your interest in science? How about art?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Djole pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Djole%20pic.jpg" width="336" height="360" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Why thank you! I am Djordje Jeremic, better known by my alter-ego, Paper Disciple (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/paperdisciple.etsy.com" title=""&gt;paperdisciple.etsy.com&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/paperdisciple.wordpress.com" title=""&gt;paperdisciple.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;). I am an acolyte of Plicania, the Origami Muse, a beautiful but fickle mistress. [Everyone chill out. Mistress is the female form of Master, and that is what I am referring to.] My Lady graced me with the curiosity and skill in origami at an early age, and while she does not require blood sacrifice (no paper cuts to date), she is a merciless tyrant over my sleep, and she demands attention. But I love her nonetheless, as she has granted me many (read: more than 2) inspirations at times of crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the following is for the skeptics of the existence of goddesses and fairies (heretics!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a legal immigrant (gasp! they do exist!). I began my exo-womb life in a hospital in Yugoslavia, a land which has changed size, shape and name with such agility that it would shame the chameleons, octopi, and cuttlefish of the world put together. Currently it is Serbia, or represented algebraically: Serbia = [(Serbia &amp;amp; Montenegro) - Montenegro - Kosovo...]. Most of my life I have moved around. At twelve I moved to Arizona, and then 2 years later to North Carolina, where I am currently residing and starting to set up some tentative roots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main interests in just about anything are divided into the want to know, and the searching for the purpose of said knowledge. It is a great pleasure to find out just how things work. Every time I learn something new, I feel like a child disassembling a watch to see the little gears spinning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing with the clock metaphor, after opening it and taking the gears out, I would look for a place to use the gears. Not just as a coffee holder, like some are fond of using CD-roms for, but wisely, according to what I learned. Knowledge without purpose is dull, and purpose without knowledge is dangerous. No, not just dangerous, but also slightly stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like art. [I would like to introduce a word here, if it is alright with everyone. Scotoma is the medical term for having a part of your vision disabled, but it is also a reference to a psychological trick. Remember the picture of the vase, where if you look at it differently, it looks like two faces? That effect.] Scotoma lends the possibility of being able to look at the same piece of art over and over again and every time see a new image. This obviously only works with abstract painting and some other forms, and I LOATHE abstract painting. A block  of random splashes does not represent the soul equivalent of a jaguar in a jungle. I respect greatly artists who can work in apparently random smears of pigment and oil, while managing to bring out more than confusion or base emotions from the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite art genres are extreme realism, and surrealism. Well, not exactly extreme realism, a photo will do, but a well done oil painting is a joy to my heart. [My atrial ventricle flaps excitedly  whenever I see any of Rembrandt's work]. Surrealism I like because it challenges your view of the world. [In Arizona I was participating in a mock Congress. My M.O. was to prepare arguments for both sides of a debate and then fight for the less represented one. I make a magnificent Devil's Advocate.] Besides, who doesn't like the image of a reverse magic carpet ride, with the carpet as the rider, rolled up and sitting on a flying human?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plane pilot. Not a Boeing, however. Being inside a gargantuan monster of steel is not my idea of a fun time. I want a one, maybe two person old style airplane, like the ones they ["They" is a weasel word and is thus not approved by Wikipedia. We're not on Wikipedia, though.] used in WW1.[not to be confused with www1, the first internet.] I want to feel the rush of the air around me. Come to think of it, the best would be if I could fly unassisted by machines. If it turns out I can't afford such a plane, I will go skydiving every weekend or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For money, I am going to either take people for rides, or fold origami professionally. Maybe even get a decent job [only if I have to]. There's not much to it. Living like the squirrel: eat what you need, store up only for one winter, and never stay too long in one place. And, everywhere I go, I will bring my trusty laptop and wi-fi hijacker [don't have one yet] although by the time I am 25, this very computer I am typing on and the one you are reading from will both be relics in a museum, antiques at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased speed and accuracy of facts. The internet serves as a library full of librarians and writers and proofreaders. If you wanted to check what the coagulation speed of 10 milliliters of baboon blood were (just a shot in the dark, I don't know why I picked the examples), all that is necessary is several clicks to get mostly accurate information. The world wide web, in my opinion, is a handy tool to have around, but is not a supplement to all research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like PloS. I do not use it as much as I would like to, but the times that I do it is educational and even fun. Every time I go there, it is like throwing darts at a carnival, but you can't miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your life and work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook? What are some of the differences in the ways teenagers use the Web in comparison to adults who grew up without it and later in life migrated online?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my blog recently, 1) as a tool of flagrant self promotion, which I used mercilessly to herd millions into buying my origami on etsy. I wish. To my knowledge, the site was only visited by a couple of people, few of which bought something. 2) as a vent for my teenage angst, romance, and idiocy. It was my wall to graffiti on. Still is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot tell what it is like to be an adult who migrated, since I am 16, but as a teenager who grew up next to it, it is natural, like an arm. The way dolphins probably viewed the ocean prior to all the filth we [homo sapiens (severe irony. sapiens means wise. )] dumped into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not discover scienceblogs.com, I was dragged headfirst into it, kicking and screaming, only to find it a nice place with polite people. I usually keep to Blog around the clock (HI BORA!) and Pharyngula, but every now and then I will trawl for fresh waters. I can't name all the people who I visited here, but they all have brilliant ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your studies, art, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. My favorites were discovering that there are adolescents of my mental age blogging, as well as the fact that there are a  LOT of people who are great company, all of them as geeky as I am and probably more. That, and it also appears that scienceblogs.com is not run by one man in a missile silo in colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Christopher Walken voice) And I... shall see you, there. *insert creepy Mr. Burns-esque photo here*&lt;/p&gt;

Or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A New Age magazine in Minnesota is under new management, and the &lt;a href="http://www.twincities.com/newsletter-morning/ci_12823168"&gt;editor wants to exercise some "quality control"&lt;/a&gt;: astrology, fairies, life-force energy, and spiritual quests are OK. Channeling and paganism are out. This has annoyed the so-open-minded-their-brains-have-fallen-out crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other New Age leaders are appalled.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"He is excluding channeling? Yikes. Or pagans? He should not be doing that," said Kathy McGee, editor of the Washington-state-based magazine New Age Retailer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&amp;quot;New Age is an umbrella term encompassing anything on a spiritual path — Bigfoot, Jesus, Buddha. Even worshipping a frog is sort of OK,&amp;quot; McGee said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She said New Age thinking is all-or-nothing — you either have an open mind to all beliefs, or you don&amp;#39;t. It is wrong for anyone to pick which beliefs are acceptable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"You don't want to say, 'This is OK, and this is not,' " McGee said. "There is nothing we would exclude. We are about goodwill to men."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Her definition, then, puts Bigfoot believers shoulder-to-shoulder beside organic farmers. Along with channeling, she includes the Fair Trade movement, which promotes products that benefit Third World farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute…worshipping a frog is &lt;i&gt;sort of OK&lt;/i&gt;? Only "sort of"? I am offended. Why is she belittling the faith of frog-worshippers all around the world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story has some interesting information about the cracks in the New Age universe. Organic farmers would rather not be associated with fairies. Chiropractors really hate it — one says, &amp;quot;That New Age connection should not be made. I cannot see how anyone can put chiropractic care and Bigfoot together.&amp;quot; To which I can only reply, well, what if Bigfoot has an aching back, huh? He&amp;#39;s bipedal, he&amp;#39;s probably got the same difficulties we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, one psychic also joyfully reports that the poor economy is helping her business.&lt;/p&gt;

Congratulations, everyone!  (If I missed your contribution to the phenomenon, let me know and I’ll edit this post.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments in the post announcing Sid &amp;amp; Rebecca’s wedding were mostly congratulatory – I admit to getting teary-eyed when watching it via UStream myself (also oohing, ahhing, and applauding several times in my living room). But some of the comments were critical of the concept of marriage, which got me thinking – and not about the topic of skepticism vs. marriage, which I think was addressed pretty well in the comments of that thread, but about the levels/boundaries of skepticism that differ in each of us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Steve Degroof said eloquently in the comments,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To all the Spocks here: Yes, marriage is irrational and ultimately unnecessary but the same could be said of wine, chocolate, jokes, art, cloud-watching, kissing and thousands of other things that make life worthwhile. &lt;strong&gt;Even skeptics have to draw the line somewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Emphasis mine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had the authority to award a COTW for saying something insightful, I’d give it to him this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last sentence of Degroof’s comment is what got me thinking. Much like vegetarians draw the line somewhere with their vegetarianism, each of us also draws the line somewhere with our skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, for argument’s sake, that a skeptic so rational that he doesn’t eat chocolate or believe in marriage is a &lt;em&gt;vegan&lt;/em&gt; skeptic. That’s an admirable level of rationality, but that lifestyle is not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I think I’m sort of a &lt;em&gt;pescetarian&lt;/em&gt; skeptic. If I check &lt;a href="http://www.whatstheharm.net"&gt;What’s the Harm&lt;/a&gt; and there’s no harm, only upside potential…I don’t see any reason not to try it. For example, I like to take a little extra Vitamin C when I have a cold (not &lt;a href="http://www.unu.edu/unupress/food/8F102e/8F102E04.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; much). And while I’m not a big wine or chocolate fan, I love caramel and butterscotch, ice cream, love, almost anything with rum, and being married to my husband. None of those may be completely rational, but they all add to the quality of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not the first to broach the subject – Elyse asked you for your non-skeptical confessions &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=2569%E2%80%9D"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, to the effect of 146 comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I know I’m not alone in acknowledging that we are all skeptics of varying degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think it’s positive that our boundaries vary, because if we all agreed upon a certain set of beliefs and practices, skepticism might resemble the dogma of religion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stacey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247590495573"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3006332761549044121">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a97a3540a1f53c26</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #129</title><published>2009-07-14T16:23:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-16T19:50:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/mondays-molecule-129.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Today&amp;#39;s molecule is very famous so you aren&amp;#39;t going to get any hints other than the fact it&amp;#39;s from the species Gallus gallusYou need to name the molecule, identify its function, and explain why it is so famous.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S.A. Alenthony&lt;/strong&gt; (a pen name) rewrote Dante’s &lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt;, but from an atheist’s perspective — Same poetic style and everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981967892?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0981967892"&gt;The Infernova&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981967892?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0981967892"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Infernova.png" alt="Infernova" title="Infernova" width="345" height="484"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major difference is that punishments would be offered to “televangelist-frauds, pedophile-priests, prophets” and more.  And instead of Virgil as a guide, Alenthony goes with someone a bit more familiar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of bushy gray hair he had no lack,&lt;br&gt;
and his moustache too was brushy and wild.&lt;br&gt;
He looked familiar. I tried to think back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where had I seen him? At this he smiled,&lt;br&gt;
for my confusion was likely quite plain.&lt;br&gt;
He spoke up then, his southern drawl mild:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”I can see I’ll have a bit to explain.&lt;br&gt;
The whys and wherefores, I’ll reach presently.&lt;br&gt;
But introductions first: I’m Mark Twain.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, I have a few copies of the book to give away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re talking about &lt;em&gt;The Inferno&lt;/em&gt;, here’s the question for you all: &lt;strong&gt;Who do *you* think deserves to go to Hell?&lt;/strong&gt;  (If it existed, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most creative answers (according to Alenthony) win a free copy of the book!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/missyho/140387211/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/55/140387211_22aab0f9b4_m.jpg" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The California Regional Center which both &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/where_should_the_go_to"&gt;Kristina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/an_extra_500000_for_staff_or_services"&gt;I blogged&lt;/a&gt; about in rapid succession last week has decided &lt;a href="http://cbs5.com/wireapnewsca/Center.for.disabled.2.1079595.html"&gt;to return the money to the state&lt;/a&gt;.  Whether this decision was good or bad--like the initial decision to spend the money on staff pay raises--is (as I stated in my last post and readers also pointed out) ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one hand, there is a connection between rate of pay and quality of worker.  Additionally, there is a connection between rate of pay and employee morale.  Even someone with no sense of money, number, or time like me has been known to do crappy work with a bad attitude when being insufficiently compensated for the work, financially or otherwise.  Just loving the work isn't always enough, and not everyone in the service field really loves the work either.  And, trying to avoid personal details here, my experience has been that $60 an hour assistants are a whole lot more helpful to me than $10 an hour assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it doesn't matter how quality the staff are if you don't actually get any staff.  So having any staff to pay at all is arguably a prerequisite to discussions about pay raises.  (Cuts to services of course affecting the providers and the end users alike.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it better for a small number of well paid staff to provide services to a small number of individuals but at the expense of quantity?  Or is it better for a large number of poorly paid staff to provide services to a larger number of individuals but at the expense of quality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments continue to come in to the forum-posted question, “What trait of your autistic child would you like to see more of in yourself or in others?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“His honesty,” said one respondent.  “The ability to be oblivious to the judgment of others,” said another. “His determination to succeed,” added another. ”The belief that everything is awesome and that the world is a wonderful place (it scares the hell out of me!)”, replied another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Absolute acceptance of everyone without regard to age, race, social status or cultural differences!” said another parent. ”Being joy-filled regardless of the situation,” said another. “My son is happy to have food whether it’s a steak dinner or hot dogs with macaroni and cheese; happy to have clothing whether from Gap or Wal-Mart; happy to hop in the car and go with family and friends whether it’s an old clunker or a Mercedes.  He is constantly enjoying the moment.  It’s beautiful!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid continuing responses to “If could say one thing to your relatives about your autistic child, what would it be?” came, “My father is an engineer, and he (and my mom) tackled it as an engineer. Went off and learned everything about it he could. Then came to the behavior sessions, the OT sessions, and became involved. He learned to love and&lt;br&gt;
appreciate my son how he is, and never really looks at how he isn’t. So the one biggest thing I would say to parents: ‘Get involved. If you don’t, you will never know your grandchild, and that would be a damned shame.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another one arrived in response to “What’s the smartest thing anyone ever said to you about your autistic child?”: “From our developmental psychiatrist shortly after we received the autism diagnosis for our (now 6-yr old) son: ‘The diagnosis label is a tool. It’s a gateway to services. Forget about autism. Concentrate on what he needs: behavioral support, OT, socialization skills, speech therapy, etc. You focus on the label; labels get ripped off and thrown away. They don’t matter. What’s inside the package matters.’”&lt;/p&gt;

This is the third post, and there will be one more after it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;American Anti-Science&lt;/strong&gt;. Myers claims the book “entirely neglects the anti-scientific forces.” This is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, Chris wrote an entire book dealing with this problem. That book,&lt;em&gt; The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt;, dealt very extensively with the anti-science forces and put them in their place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tries not to reinvent the wheel, but rather to go beyond its predecessor–and indeed, we’ve been describing it as the sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt;. This time around, we don’t structure the book by scientific topic, so you won’t find chapter-length refutations of the creationists, the global warming deniers, and so on. However, Chris has refuted them all at great length elsewhere, and they get more than adequate licks in the new book as well. (Indeed, we’ve added some smackdowns of the anti-vaccinationists this time around!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Myers would have preferred a book that contained nothing more than entertaining skewerings of anti-science idiocy–but Chris &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465046762/chriscmooneyc-20/"&gt;wrote that book already&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tries to take the next step and explore the &lt;em&gt;reasons&lt;/em&gt; for the disconnects between science and society, because &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt; the true nature of anti-science sentiment and its causes is no less important than &lt;em&gt;debunking&lt;/em&gt; it. They’re both important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.&lt;strong&gt; Root Causes&lt;/strong&gt;. Myers claims the book “demands we avoid addressing the structural roots” of the problem of science in society. That’s false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more charitable reading would be that we differ with Myers about what the root causes are, or place different emphases upon them. Clearly, he thinks religion is a much bigger root cause–if not &lt;em&gt;the only&lt;/em&gt; root cause–than we do. But why then doesn’t he just say that we differ, instead of mischaracterizing our position?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We too want to address root causes–we just don’t think religion is the root of all our problems. It is &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;cause of anti-science sentiment, to be sure–a very prominent one. But not the only one. Our book also deals with many others: The nature of the media; the nature of politics; the nature of the scientific community, and so on. It may be easier to simply single out religion, but we’re not convinced it gets us where we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Science in the Entertainment Industry. &lt;/strong&gt;Chris spent a month out in LA meeting with experts on the entertainment industry or talking with them by phone, trying to work out why science often gets such a bad shake in film and on television. The result was a report on how the entertainment industry works, and why scientists are often unhappy with the result–and what can be done to change this. (Some of this content is now reiterated in our &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/07/13/science_illiteracy/"&gt;Salon.com adaptation from the book&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this chapter, Myers finds a single sentence about Richard Dawkins to quote [his emphasis]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawkins and some other scientists fail to grasp that in Hollywood, the story is paramount—that narrative, drama, and character development will trump &lt;strong&gt;mere factual accuracy&lt;/strong&gt; every time, and by a very long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Myers dubs “exasperating nonsense, in which Mooney and Kirshenbaum are discussing how to get science into the popular media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myers is quoting out of context in order to criticize us. Here’s what he (and all of his readers who have not read our book) are missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins was quoted in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; saying that the film &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; didn’t even need to have human characters in it, because the dinosaurs were so stunning. His words were: “The natural world is fascinating in its own right. It really doesn’t need human drama to be fascinating.” We provide this quotation, and the accompanying context, in the book. Myers does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming Dawkins was quoted accurately, these words shows how little he understands about mass entertainment. A film with just dinosaurs running around would never have been so successful (and would never have been made). That was our point. Dawkins’ statement about Hollywood and &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt; epitomizes the type of mindset that has kept scientists from having more productive encounters with the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now look at how Myers strives to defend Dawkins against us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Mooney and Kirshenbaum fail to grasp is that to a scientist, factual accuracy must be paramount; it is not a matter on which we can compromise. Further, what they fail to recognize, and what they excuse for Hollywood, as that &lt;em&gt;accuracy does not have to compromise narrative, drama, and character!&lt;/em&gt; They berate Dawkins as if he has no awareness of the basics of what makes a good story, which makes me wonder if they’ve read any of his books at all — do they think he simply drily recites a body of abstract thoughts at the reader? Perhaps they should take a look at &lt;em&gt;The Ancestor’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/061861916X/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=061861916X&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=061861916X&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=061861916X" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to discover that he actually has addressed this imaginary deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, in context, it is absurd to think that factual accuracy would be &lt;u&gt;paramount&lt;/u&gt; in a movie like &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for that matter, what can Myers possibly be saying about Dawkins’ admittedly very good writing? That &lt;em&gt;The Ancestor’s Tale&lt;/em&gt; could be made into just as successful a movie as &lt;em&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jurassicpark.htm"&gt;grossed nearly $ 1 billion worldwide&lt;/a&gt;? Again, that’s pretty hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Solutions. &lt;/strong&gt;Myers claims the book “offers no new solutions.” That’s false–the book is brimming with solutions. Chad Orzel even found one we couldn’t fit into the main text–the idea of forming a Science PAC to get more scientists elected to Congress–buried in an endnote, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/07/scientist_pacs_and_judges.php"&gt;built an entire discussion around it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are solutions in each chapter of the main body of the book, broken down by sector–politics, media, entertainment, religion. And then there is the grand solution in Chapter 10–which emerged from our collaboration, and which we don’t think either of us would have come up with on our own. So far as we know, it really is new in its particular way of analyzing the academic pipeline and finding, in it, a solution to our problems at the science-society interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we would ask that readers consult the book, rather than Myers’ review, to determine whether it really offers “no new solutions.” And we’d also direct them over to the review at &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/"&gt;RealClimate&lt;/a&gt;, where a productive discussion about solutions has, indeed, been sparked by the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference in perceptions in these reviews is certainly remarkable. It’s clear that those who are invested in the “New Atheism” have a strong negative reaction to the book–but is that surprising, in that the book strongly criticizes the “New Atheism”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for those who do not have such a strong investment, yet care about the promotion and communication of science–like &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/"&gt;Michael Mann of Real Climate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/7/12/751063/-Book-Review:-Unscientific-America"&gt;Darksyde of Daily Kos&lt;/a&gt;, and many others–the book has prompted much valuable thought, response, and commentary. We’re very honored to see that it is having this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In our final post, tomorrow, we will conclude our responses to the claims in PZ’s review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>the intersection</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247585593629"><id gr:original-id="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7134/science.aspx">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e581b2eb0530f0f0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science In The News Daily"/><title type="html">Squashing Superbugs - The Race for New Antibiotics</title><published>2009-07-14T16:14:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T16:14:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.americanscientist.org/science/id.7134/science.aspx" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.americanscientist.org/rss/id.2/publications.aspx" type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Superbug Strikes in City" sounds like a horror movie title, but instead it is a headline printed in the October 26, 2007, edition of the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;.

Mooney and Kirshenbaum make much of the fact that those wicked "New Atheists" are going to drive away support for science, a fact not in evidence, but they seem oblivious to the fact that their recommendation to hush up a significant element of the public voice of science is going to alienate &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt;, and it's working to bite them in the ass right now. In other words, &lt;a href="http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/unscientific-unscientific-america-part-1/"&gt;Jerry Coyne's review of their book&lt;/a&gt; is online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'll start with my overall opinion of the book, which is that it is confused, tendentious, evanescent, and preachy.  It is a blog post blown up to book length.  Yes, there are some useful parts, in particular the emphasis on science communication and the need to reward those who are good at it. But these solutions are hardly new; indeed, I could find little in &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/i&gt; that has not been said, at length, elsewhere. And what is new—the accusation that scientists, in particular atheist-scientists, are largely responsible for scientific illiteracy—is asserted without proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am still endlessly amazed at how proponents of congenial communication, like Mooney and Nisbet, manage to so consistently piss off the targets of their discussions while trying to appease the people who care least about good science.&lt;/p&gt;

The Republicans are tilting at one of their favorite windmills, the mad scientists' dream of creating an unholy union between beast and human to produce a slave race of soulless monsters. They have &lt;a href="http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2009/07/10/republicans-introduce-bill-to-ban-human-animal-hybrids/"&gt;introduced legislation to ban human-animal hybrids&lt;/a&gt;. And it's even bipartisan! They've got 19 Rethuglicans, like Sam Brownback, the ignoramus from Kansas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once only science fiction is now becoming a reality, and we need to ensure that experimentation and subsequent ramifications do not outpace ethical discussion and societal decisions. History does not look kindly on those who violate the dignity of the human person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they've also got 1 Dimocrat, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here in the United States, we simply cannot open the door to the unethical blending of humans and animals, which the British government seems intent on doing. It creates an unnatural species and is a clear line we cannot cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One teensy little problem: these clowns do not understand the science. We actually aren&amp;#39;t planning to creating a slave-race of beast-men; the technology isn&amp;#39;t there, for one thing, and for another, that&amp;#39;s really not at all an interesting goal. No one is planning on operating on any human persons, or even violating them; the focus is all on cells and molecules. This is routine stuff. In one hand, you&amp;#39;ve got a dish full of human cells — it doesn&amp;#39;t talk, it can&amp;#39;t sign a consent form even if it had the capacity to understand one — and you want to know what makes them tick. In the other hand, you&amp;#39;ve got a collection of hard-won tools you&amp;#39;ve gathered from work in mice or worms or flies; interesting vectors, genes that act as indicators or switches, ways to basically reach into a cell and toggle states. Scientists have had these for years, and we&amp;#39;ve regularly used these tools to manipulate cells and puzzle out what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: we want to know what genes on different human chromosomes do, but it is highly unethical to do random mutagenesis on human gametes, bring them together, and then raise up the fetus in a volunteer's womb to find out what interesting ways it might go kablooiee. One technique that has been used is to make mouse-human hybrid cells: use a little ethylene glycol to weaken the cell membranes, push a mouse cell next to a human cell, and presto, they fuse. They then recover and go through cell divisions, and the hybrid cell begins to lose pieces of the unnatural excess of chromosomes it's got. You can then screen the resultant cells and correlate the presence or absence of gene products with the presence or absence of specific human chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. It sounds so nefarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more example: scientists have made transgenic pigs carrying five human genes. The idea is to create animals that can be a source for xenografts — transplanted organs — in humans with a reduced level of rejection. These pigs would become illegal under the Brownback bill, because they mingle a blessedly human H-transferase gene with pig cells. This is not to argue that there are no ethical considerations in these kinds of experiments, since there certainly are: we can argue about the ethics of creating species of pigs with the specialized purpose of providing organs for human use (it&amp;#39;s about as great a moral dilemma as raising pigs for meat), and there&amp;#39;s also the concern that hybrid pigs will also be dangerous incubators for training viruses to respond to human epitopes. But the ethical debates aren&amp;#39;t the domain of crude science-fiction versions of the science that these clueless lawmakers think them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like Brownback to answer a simple question. Does putting the human insulin or growth factor gene into &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; violate the dignity of the human person? If it does, he's suggesting shutting down a good chunk of the pharmaceutical industry. And Ms Landrieu: what is an "unnatural species"? If they're unnatural and we can't cross that line, then we certainly don't need legislation to enforce it.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;I don't know why she bothered to complain about the British government, unless she's using just plain old conservative xenophobia to stir up votes. &lt;i&gt;American&lt;/i&gt; scientists have been using hybrid cells and have been introducing cross-species genes into cells for a long, long time now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/why_do_they_hate_the_manimal.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/igcvRjazX7A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247579686416"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-9066762004589472498">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/398bdacf1347f0fe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Timmy's Takes Manhattan</title><published>2009-07-14T12:03:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T12:25:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/timmys-takes-manhattan.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/9066762004589472498/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=9066762004589472498" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Tim Hortons is opening 13 stores in Manhattan  and several more in Brooklyn.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tfnblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/12/gail-lowe-politics-and-social-studies/"&gt;She is yet another in a long series of ill-qualified religious ideologues on the Texas BoE&lt;/a&gt;: she wants to insert &amp;quot;strengths and weaknesses&amp;quot; into the curriculum (the weaknesses to which they refer don’t really exist; they really mean false creationist attacks on evolution), she wants to make classes more political, she wants to remove other solid scientific reasoning from science classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting indeed that you find none of this &lt;a href="http://www.gaillowecampaign.com/SBOE_Duties.htm"&gt;when you go to her website&lt;/a&gt;. Instead you find vague claims about her stances which give almost no real information. Of course, her record is pretty clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the head of the BoE is once again someone with antiscience beliefs. I wonder if they’ll appoint Jenny McCarthy as head of their Department of Health? &lt;/p&gt;

The hypothesis is that a finite set of temporal filters are used by the brain to determine whether an underlying signal is present in white noise.  Press button 1 if you see a shape in the noise, press button 2 if you see nothing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The authors then take the probability of humans detecting a signal for a variety of variables - signal to noise ratio, contrast level of the signal, and so on - and then fit a set of filter functions so as to reproduce the accuracy of a human.  They don't care about the actual neural mechanisms bringing about these filters, they simply want to find the deterministic shape of the filters, and to estimate how many filters the brain typically uses in such a task.  They take human data and use it to fit the shape of the filters so as to mimic a human.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We know that the brain isn't perfect at detecting signals, so let's take some functions that ignore too-weak signals, slap it on top of the input, and call that a model!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now, I'm not entirely being fair here.  Using the deterministic shape of these models, one could (in theory) build a biologically plausible network of spiking neurons that produce this behavior, so it's not that the paper is useless, or that black-box modeling is useless.  It just seems... well... superfluous.  It seems like the experiments done with humans were solely to determine the threshold of signal-to-noise ratio past which we can clearly discern a signal... I'm not sure what contribution the filters provide, other than to determine the minimal computational legwork that the brain needs to be doing to solve this problem.  In other words, this paper's primary contribution seems to be in placing &lt;i&gt;mathematical&lt;/i&gt; bounds, as opposed to making biologically plausible hypotheses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In that sense, it is a spectacular black-box modeling paper.  We don't know how this black box works, so lets put some data into it and see what it spits out.  Let's come up with a statistical description of what we get out of the black box as a function of what we put into the black box.  In another sense, though, it illustrates why black-box modeling is like fast food.  Sometimes, you have a real craving but when you finish, you feel dissatisfied.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;you try to describe : you grab some french fries :: you describe but fail to explain : you are still hungry&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Vision+Research&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2FS0042-6989%2897%2900239-3&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Estimating+multiple+temporal+mechanisms+in+human+vision&amp;amp;rft.issn=00426989&amp;amp;rft.date=1998&amp;amp;rft.volume=38&amp;amp;rft.issue=7&amp;amp;rft.spage=1023&amp;amp;rft.epage=1040&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0042698997002393&amp;amp;rft.au=Fredericksen%2C+R.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Neuroscience%2CBehavioral+Neuroscience"&gt;Fredericksen, R.

The second post asks the question: Okay, let’s say we realign academic and other resources to focus on making scientists better communicators. What exactly are we going to &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does all this have to do with &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=chriscmooneyc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? The book rests pretty solidly on the premise that scientists could do a better job of communicating with the public, and that such improved communication would do much to improve the odds that scientists could persuade the public that the pursuit of science is a societal good, that scientific information ought to play an important role in informing policy decisions, and so forth. I’m willing to accept the premise that scientists could communicate with the public more frequently, more clearly, and in a way that addresses the public’s interests more directly. But I think it’s reasonable to ask how much movement we can expect in what the public values in response to such improvements in communication.&lt;/p&gt;

True, we did have a late night diversion to Denny's because we were starving, but by 2 AM or so we were back home. Time to go to bed. Time to go back to work. No more Las Vegas.

This has been demonstrated for decades now in several species: mice, yeast, and roundworms. The big question has always been – does this research apply to humans. There are those who are banking on the answer being yes, but the data is just not in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research suggests we may not be able to extrapolate this research to humans. One of the correlates of life extension in mice with calorie restriction is reduced levels of the hormone IGF-1.  However, humans on a restricted calorie diet did &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=385"&gt;not have reduced levels of IGF-1&lt;/a&gt;. We do not yet understand enough about the effects of calorie restriction and their relationship to life extension to know exactly what this means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the question of whether or not calorie restriction will work in humans remains open. But &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/709/1"&gt;new research shows&lt;/a&gt;, for the first time, that calorie restriction extends life expectancy in primates.  The journal Science reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying aging in monkeys takes patience. Mice and rats only live for a couple of years, while these monkeys can live to 40, and the average life span is 27 years. Now that the surviving monkeys have reached their mid- to late 20s, the Wisconsin group could glean how calorie restriction was affecting their life span. Sixty-three percent of the calorie-restricted animals are still alive compared to only 45% of their free-feeding counterparts. For age-related deaths caused by illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, the voracious eaters died at three times the rate of restricted monkeys: 14 versus five monkeys, respectively. Another seven control and nine lean monkeys died from causes not related to aging such as complications from anesthesia or injuries. Leaner diets also reduced muscle and brain gray matter deterioration, two conditions associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three groups studying calorie restriction in primates – this is the first group to publish their results.  This group of rhesus monkeys will continue to be followed to years, and so we will still get more data from them, plus we will be able to compare to the two other groups. If all three groups show statistically significant life extension, that will be fairly solid evidence for an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very significant to the question of whether or not this calorie restriction effect applies to humans. It is a much shorter trip from monkeys to humans than it is from yeast or even mice to humans. This is precisely why for certain questions we still need to do research on primates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even still, monkey research will not be definitive. We will still need to study the effect in humans, which of course is very difficult. It takes decades to see an effect, and it is tedious to follow many individuals in sufficient detail over that period of time. So far research has focused on studying biological markers (like the IGF-1 study) not net effects. While this type of research is very useful and often predictive, it is never definitive. Eventually we will need studies looking at the net effects of calories restriction in large numbers of humans over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monkey research is a significant boon to those claiming calorie restriction extends life, but it does not end the debate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247573558998"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8015682948559965299">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b087cd5b833e4e0e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Is Yahweh a Moral Monster?</title><published>2009-07-15T03:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T10:59:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/hckxEU3wECs/is-yahweh-moral-monster.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/8015682948559965299/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=8015682948559965299" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/is-yahweh-moral-monster.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">It all started recently with Richard Dawkins and his charge that the God of the Old Testament is the most unpleasant fictional character he'd ever seen.

&lt;p&gt;
The Amazing Meeting 7 and Freedom Fest were both held over the same weekend in Las Vegas, the former at the new and beautiful South Point Hotel and the latter at the classic old Bally’s hotel and casino. I spoke at both and attended as many talks as I could fit in while shuttling back and forth between events. Some impressions:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Business is definitely down in Vegas. Every taxi driver I asked put the downturn at about 35% lower than normal, and between the two casinos we passed the new MGM-backed casino under construction but now abandoned due to lack of funding to complete construction. There were never any taxi lines and room rates at both hotels were well below the normal too-high rates. Nevertheless, there seemed to be plenty of folks at the slots and tables, trying to recover their 401K losses, obviously having never taken a basic course in probabilities (my system: I give the casino $500 and ask if I can play for a couple of hours: “you’re going to get the money anyway and I just want to have some fun.” I’ve never had success with this sytem.). &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
TAM had about 1000 people in attendance, while FreedomFest had about 1500. Shortly after I arrived I was called up for a private meeting with Randi, who later announced to the group that he had recently undergone a serious medical procedure to rid his body of something that wasn’t suppose to be there, and it looks like they got it all but just in case he’ll have to undergo chemo treatment after TAM, just to insure that there are no renegade cells floating about. When I saw Randi in his hotel room, his voice was a little weak and he seemed frail, yet the next morning when he stood at the podium to address his fans, he came to life, energized by the standing O he received, and suddenly his voice switched to his rich sonorous self as he regaled the audience with tales of his latest exploits among medics and psychics. Randi is such an experienced and professional entertainer that he just comes to life when there’s an audience. At age 80, I know that Randi is going to have a tough time of it (chemo is nasty business indeed), but he’s one of the toughest guys I know so I’m confident that we’ll have Randi around for many more years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:570px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/TAM7-IMG_0532.jpg" alt="Randi, Penn, Teller, Ray Hyman, Jamy Ian Swiss.

Only the scientist has two names; the magicians have either one or three names. Um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On Friday afternoon I spoke at FreedomFest on myths about Darwin, including: that Darwin was an atheist (he was an agnostic); that acceptance of evolution theory leads to atheism (obviously not since 40% of American scientists — all of whom accept evolution — believe in God); that Darwin was always an evolutionist and got that from his grandfather Erasmus (Darwin was a creationist before and during the voyage of the Beagle and didn’t become an evolutionist until nearly a year after his return); that Darwin was a racial egalitarian (he was against slavery, and although he was very progressive in his social attitudes about race compared to his contemporaries, compared to people today Darwin, like his birthday twin Abraham Lincoln, did not believe that the races were biologically equal); that evolution is progressive and is “leading” somewhere (it isn’t leading anywhere — there are certain convergences in evolution, such as locomotion, hearing, seeing, etc., but there is nothing inevitable about, say, human intelligence); that evolution is “red in tooth and claw” and is nothing more than nasty, competitive, brutish, and bloody (a successful strategy for survival among social animals is pro-social, cooperative, and involves mutual aid among members of a group); and that conservatives should not accept evolution because it doesn’t explain human nature as Christians see it (in fact, as I argued in &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b111PB" title="ORDER the book from Skeptic.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Darwin Matters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Christian view of human nature is very similar to that of a Darwinian human nature). My talk seemed to go over well, perhaps because I share similar political and economic beliefs as the conservatives and libertarians at FreedomFest, so to have “one of their own” explain why it’s okay to accept evolutionary theory perhaps makes it all easier to swallow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:310px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/left-right-diagram.png" alt="diagram by David Nolan" title="heuristic diagram" width="300" height="303"&gt;&lt;p&gt;diagram by David Nolan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Likewise, I think that my talk at TAM Saturday morning, entitled “Rise Above: Toward a Type I Civilization,” was equally well received. At least everyone who said something to me afterwards seemed positive about it (perhaps my critics will just email me later). Even the famed magician Jamy Ian Swiss, who is most definitely not a libertarian, said he liked my talk. When I said “really?”, he responded, “yes, absolutely; of course, I still disagree with you on many points,” which I took as a compliment. During my talk I put up a side of a well-known heuristic diagram for classifying yourself politically, that moves beyond the traditional left — right spectrum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I then asked for a show of hands among the 1,007 people in the audience of who identifies themselves as left of center (I estimated about 80%), libertarian (I estimated about 20%), and right of center (a grand total of 4 people raised their hands!). I then reviewed the standard left-right stereotypes of what liberals think of conservatives, and vice versa:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Conservatives are a bunch of gun-totting, Hummer-driving, hard-drinking, Bible-thumping, black-and-white-thinking, fist-pounding, shoe-stomping, morally-hypocritical blowhards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Naturally, this received a huge round of applause, along with hooting and hollering in agreement. But, to my surprise, so too did my characterization of what conservatives think of liberals:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Liberals are a bunch of tree-hugging, whale-saving, hybrid-driving, sandle-wearing, bottled-water-drinking, ACLU-supporting, flip-flopping, wishy-washy, Namby Pamby bedwetters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I then suggested that we need to “rise above” such stereotypes, and proposed a solution based on the research by the University of Virginia psychologist Jonathan Haidt and his model of morality that allows us to avoid being trapped by such linear left-right thinking in which one side is right and the other side is wrong. You can read my summary of Jonathan’s research in last week’s blog, but recall that Haidt argues that there are &lt;em&gt;5 foundations of morality&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Harm-Care&lt;/em&gt; (do not harm others, people should be cared for)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Fairness-Reciprocity&lt;/em&gt; (justice for all)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;In-group Loyalty&lt;/em&gt; (we live in a dangerous tribal world so we need group unity)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Authority-Respect&lt;/em&gt; (a free society depends on the rule of law and law-and-order)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Purity-Sanctity&lt;/em&gt; (conservatives: sex, drugs, rock’n’roll; liberals: food, environment)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of one side being right and the other wrong, I think we would all be better served if we recognize that liberals and conservatives emphasize different moral values: Liberals are high on the Harm-Care and Fairness-Reciprocity dimensions, but low on Loyalty, Authority-Respect, Purity-Sanctity; whereas conservatives are about equal on the 5 dimensions (although slightly less on Harm-Care and Fairness-Reciprocity, slightly higher on Loyalty, Authority-Respect, Purity-Sanctity).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:570px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Skeptic_booth.jpg" alt="photo by Daniel Loxton" width="560" height="281"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers Jason Loxton and Jillian Baker staff the Skeptics Society table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an example of this difference between emphasizing individual v. group morality, I showed a clip from one of my favorite films, Rob Reiner’s 1992 &lt;em&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/em&gt;, in which Jack Nicholson’s character — the battle-hardened Marine Colonel Nathan R. Jessup — is being cross-examined by Tom Cruise’s naive rookie Navy lawyer Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee. In the context of Haidt’s moral dimensions, I think of Kaffee as the liberal and Jessup as the conservative. Kaffee is defending two Marines accused of killing a fellow soldier named Santiago at Guantanamo base on Cuba. He thinks Jessup ordered a “code red,” an off-the-books command to rough up a lazy Marine trainee in need of discipline, and that matters got tragically out of hand. Kaffee wants answers to specific questions about the incident. Jessup wants to lecture him on the meaning of freedom and the need to defend it. The ensuing dialogue includes Jessup’s penetrating testimony about the true nature of human nature:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jessup&lt;/strong&gt;: You want answers?!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Kaffee&lt;/strong&gt;: I want the truth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jessup&lt;/strong&gt;: You can’t handle the truth!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Jessup (continuing&lt;/strong&gt;): Son, we live in a world that has walls. And those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who’s gonna do it? You? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago’s death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don’t want the truth. Because deep down, in places you don’t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall. We use words like honor, code, loyalty … we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use ’em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in which I provide it. I’d prefer you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don’t give a damn what you think you’re entitled to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="width:260px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/TAM7-IMG_0533.jpg" alt="Who is the man and what is he thinking? Write your answer in the comments section." width="250" height="334"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is the man and what is he thinking? Write your answer in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The fact is we need all five moral dimensions. Personally, I tend more toward the liberal emphasis on individual fairness and justice and freedom, and I think our inner tribalisms are divisive and set people against one another, and so overemphasizing loyalty to group and nation can be dangerous. But ever since 9/11 I’ve come to see that we do live in a world with walls, and that those walls need to be guarded by men with guns. And when it comes to religious tribal fundamentalisms I think liberals agree with me on this point (certainly Sam Harris in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393327655?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393327655" title="ORDER the book from Amazon.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of Faith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Richard Dawkins in &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/productlink/b113HB" title="ORDER the book from Skeptic.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; make the point that fundamentalist religions are dangerous, and both are liberals).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the long run, however, we need to rise above all this tribalism, and that’s what I mean by my lecture subtitle: “toward a Type I Civilization.” Next week I’ll outline the Kardashev scale of typing civilizations and suggest how we can move from where we are now to a global Type I civilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Michael Shermer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247573247533"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13786">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a3566dcd3355c35c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheist Bus Ads"/><category term="FFRF"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">Atheist Billboard in Alabama Makes Christians Angry</title><published>2009-07-14T11:00:37Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T11:00:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/14/atheist-billboard-in-alabama-makes-christians-angry/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Freedom From Religion Foundation has been putting this billboard up across the country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/imaginenoreligionbillboard.jpg" title="imaginenoreligionbillboard.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/imaginenoreligionbillboard.jpg" alt="imaginenoreligionbillboard.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Imagine No Religion” is hardly offensive… it doesn’t attack or mock a particular faith.  It merely suggests the thought of life without religion using the words of &lt;strong&gt;John Lennon&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the Alabama Freethought Association helped put that billboard up in Birmingham, Alabama, &lt;a href="http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20090711/NEWS/907109886/1007?Title=-Religion-billboard-brings-debate"&gt;all hell broke loose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it was rejected by Lamar advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“It was offensive to me,” said Tom Traylor, general manager of Lamar Advertising in Birmingham. “We have the autonomy to decide what’s in the best interests of our company and what’s offensive. I don’t think it was the kind of message we wanted to stand behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to know what area of the country you’re in,” he said. “A heavy percent of our population is Christian. That’s who we cater to.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billboard did eventually find a home with Bentley Advertising.  (Yay!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the “irate” phone calls and nasty insults began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that the article in &lt;em&gt;The Tuscaloosa News&lt;/em&gt; quotes FFRF member &lt;strong&gt;Pat Cleveland&lt;/strong&gt;.  She runs the annual Lake Hypatia Advance, is incredibly pleasant, and is impossible to dislike.  (Unless, apparently, you’re a Christian who hates billboards.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She proves &lt;a href="http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20090711/NEWS/907109886/1007?Title=-Religion-billboard-brings-debate"&gt;why she’s awesome&lt;/a&gt; in the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cleveland, 63, said the calls she’s received are “ugly” and “hateful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said I ought to be where John Lennon is, burning in hell. I’m sorry if anybody is offended, but I’ve seen billboards that offend me, like ones that say ‘Jesus is Lord’ over Talladega.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud to be an American,” Cleveland said. “I refrain from any religion. I’m a good person. I pay taxes, abide by the law and I’m good to my family. I help people. I believe hands that help are better than hands that pray.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Christians in Alabama have shown that they can’t handle a simple billboard.  If they want to take on a nice lady, they’re going to lose that battle, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we get atheist bus in Birmingham soon?  Give these Christian enough rope, and they just might hang themselves… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Benjamin&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

Just take a moment to let that sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, you might ask, is a genie being sued? For alleged theft and harassment, duh! Genies gotta live too, you know. And the harassment was in the form of “threatening voicemails.” I cannot contain my laughter any further. This story is so ridiculous. Some dude made crank phone calls and I’m guessing said that they were a genie. . .and this family bought it. But maybe I’m giving them too much credit. Maybe nobody called them or they did receive threatening voicemails but just immediately assumed that caller had to have been a genie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, but don’t worry. This story gets better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed in Shariah court accuses the genie of leaving them threatening voicemails, stealing their cell phones and hurling rocks at them when they leave their house at night, said Al-Watan newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly no other possibility exists. As everyone knows, only genies have the power and the inclination to throw rocks at people at night when it’s dark.I’m suddenly reminded of &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/54-of-icelanders-dont-deny-the-existence-of-elves/"&gt;the “elves” in Iceland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to verify the truthfulness of this case despite the difficulty of doing so,” Sheikh Amr Al Salmi, the head of the court, told Al-Watan. “What makes this case and complaint more interesting is that it wasn’t filed by just one person. Every member of the family is part of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We began hearing strange noises,” the head of the family, who requested anonymity, told Al-Watan. “In the beginning, we didn’t take it seriously, but after that, stranger things started happening and the children got really scared when the genie began throwing stones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But then again, maybe I’m being too harsh. It’s not like they’re claiming that the genie had the power to turn water into wine, demanded they eat his flesh and blood which looks suspiciously like a Trisket, or rose from the dead. Now that would be crazy!&lt;/p&gt;

Ron Hubbard once said “The way to make a million dollars is to start a religion.” And I’ll add that if you want to get away with organized crime in the U.S., the way to do that is to start a religion. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_(Christian_political_organization)#The_house_on_C_Street"&gt;The Family&lt;/a&gt; is proof of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a report about the C-Street “safe house” run by The Family, which houses conservative politicians, including seven members of Congress who are sworn to secrecy about the group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/the-family-is-back-and-up-to-no-good-as-usual/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/dox4jdW4UyQ/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike all those made up conspiracies, The Family is the real deal, a secret society that actually influences government policy. If this freaks you out, don’t worry. It only means that you’re sane.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d like to offer a breath of fresh air in the form of a book by Mark Sloan, MD: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Day-Pediatrician-Explores-Childbirth/dp/0345502868"&gt;Birth Day: A Pediatrician Explores the Science, the History, and the Wonder of Childbirth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a very positive book. Sloan has attended over 3000 deliveries but he has not lost his sense of wonder. He tells us what life is like in the womb – how much the fetus can see and hear - and smell! He explains the labor process. He explains how a fetus has to rapidly adapt to life outside the womb with a number of physiologic changes. He reflects the joy of bringing a new life into a family, and the experience of becoming a father. He delves into the history of childbirth, with fascinating anecdotes about “salting” newborns, Queen Victoria’s influence on obstetric analgesia, and the attempt to keep forceps a proprietary secret of one family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He shows the many contributions science has made to childbirth, some of the mistakes it made along the way, and how it corrected those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He covers the history of medical interventions in childbirth both from a scientific and a sympathetic human viewpoint. Twilight sleep, epidurals, fetal monitors, C-sections, birthing positions, attendance by doulas, etc. He makes a strong case for having someone, anyone, stay with the mother throughout the process; there is evidence that this improves outcome. He covers the pros and cons of various types of analgesia and suggests that nitrous oxide could be used more often. He discusses the reasons for the rising C-section rate and carefully considers the risks and benefits of surgical deliveries, including physiology-based arguments I had not heard before. He covers the alarming new trend of elective primary C-sections by mothers who just don’t want to go through childbirth. He discusses circumcision from a neutral standpoint – he doesn’t recommend it, but he does it at parents’ request and he recognizes that there are medical benefits although they are far from compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains the newborn reflexes like “stepping” and the Moro reflex in terms of evolution: primate babies needed to grab onto Mom and pull themselves to a nipple; and he says if left undisturbed on its mother’s abdomen, a human baby’s neonatal reflexes allow it to little by little inch itself up to the breast and find the nipple over the course of half an hour. I didn’t know that. I find it fascinating. I’d love to see a video of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is full of interesting facts and anecdotes. A human birth takes 30 times as long as a gorilla birth: he discusses the anatomical changes in humans that prolong the process, and possible evolutionary explanations for them. He discusses cord care. The umbilical cord stump can take a long time to fall off – Dr. Sloan’s personal record was “88 parent-torturing days”! He tells about an embarrassing incident from his medical school days when he thought something looked funny about the fetal head but failed to recognize it was a breech presentation. He tells about Apgar Guy – a father who harassed him, wanting him to alter the medical record to show that his baby’s Apgar was really a 10 rather than a 9, as if that would somehow improve his child’s prospects. He tells about the expectant father who ran all the way to the hospital, slipped on the floor, knocked himself out, and woke up to find out his wife was at another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fascinating book by a science-based doctor, a wise clinician, and a loving father. An example of what the scientific approach to medicine is all about, showing that it need not be cold and impersonal.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, we interrupt this &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/summertime"&gt;summertime&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_hawaiian"&gt;beach trips&lt;/a&gt; and bike rides and (in the US) Extended School Year" to talk about IEPs. Specifically, Charlie's IEP: While his &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_long_way_up"&gt;IEP meeting&lt;/a&gt; back in May was cordial and efficient, things thereafter took an interesting turn. This morning, there is a district-requested IEP meeting regarding Charlie's education.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if I'm sounding vague here, it's intentional: I'm not the only parent curious about whether her child's school district and others read her blog.) (Hello school district, if you are reading.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spent some of a sunshiney Monday in July reviewing the &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt; Individuals with Disabilities Education Act &lt;/a&gt;. Many of you are more than familiar with the &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/"&gt;Wrightslaw&lt;/a&gt; website and publications, as well as sites like &lt;a href="http://www.aboutautismlaw.com/"&gt;AboutAutismLaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.copaa.org/"&gt;COPAA&lt;/a&gt;, the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates. COPAA holds that "the key to effective educational programs for children with disabilities is collaboration -as equals- by parents and educators." I always remind myself, no matter how many IEP meetings we've been through, how many books and studies we've read, how many conferences and lectures we've attended, how many parents we've been in touch with about; no matter how set in my memory acronyms like "FAPE and "LRE" have become, I still need to refresh my knowledge. Being an equal part of our son's education means that we have to be, as we are, actively and thoroughly involved in his learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this, I've been reflecting on a statement from a July 12th article in the &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_12818543"&gt;Denver Post&lt;/a&gt; about special education in Colorado, which "ranks 51st in a field that includes the District of Columbia for its contribution to special education."  The Special Education Program at the &lt;a href="http://www.thelegalcenter.org/index.php?s=42"&gt;Legal Center for People With Disabilities and Older People&lt;/a&gt; found that, in the Aurora Public School District, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;.....staffers [were] doing what they thought was right — &lt;em&gt;as far as they knew [my emphasis]&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often is it that special education teachers and staff honestly think they are doing the right thing, but they really aren't according to the &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov/"&gt;Individuals with Disabilities Education Act&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_12818543"&gt;Denver Post&lt;/a&gt; notes the rise in students with disabilities in general and with autism in particular in Colorado schools, as well as the fact that funding to school districts has not risen to match the needs of students. The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_ed_in_the_us_restraints_the_police"&gt;recent report on restraint and aversives in public schools&lt;/a&gt; in the US is noted. Colorado does have rules restricting the use of restraints (it is one of seven states that do) but does not have such regulations for the use of seclusion and isolation. Do teachers know this? Are strategies devised and approved by parents so that, if (and when) a student with disabilities might become very upset, teachers and staff know in advance what is legal and safe to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a challenge enough, it seems, for teachers and staff to be able to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_miscommunication"&gt;adequately communicate&lt;/a&gt; about what is going on in the classroom. But how many conflicts, how much confusion, could be avoided with better adherence too and knowledge of the law by school districts? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only because of a law---IDEA---that my son and many children are &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_we_need_to_fully_fund_idea"&gt;able to be in school at all&lt;/a&gt;, and are able to get the education they need in order to lead the full, productive, good lives that is their civil right. And because of the ongoing issue of communication for Charlie and individuals like him, and the constant potential for &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;miscommunication&lt;/a&gt; and of his rights and safety not being respected, invoke IDEA we must, year in and year out. Education takes no vacation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247557044195"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3785">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88545bd690049faa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Health"/><category term="Religion and Public Policy"/><category term="9th Circuit Court of Appeals"/><category term="contraception"/><category term="morning after pill"/><category term="pharmacist"/><category term="Plan B"/><title type="html">Religious pharmacists are going to need their own Plan B</title><published>2009-07-14T07:30:41Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T07:30:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/religious-pharmacists-are-going-to-need-their-own-plan-b/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neworleansblack.com/images/Morning%20after%20pill%20sales%20jump%20as%20access%20eases.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.neworleansblack.com/images/Morning%20after%20pill%20sales%20jump%20as%20access%20eases.jpg" alt="" width="223" height="167"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For some time now, religious pharmacists have been fighting a legal battle arguing for the right to refuse to dispense the morning after pill Plan B on religious grounds. Then a district court gave them temporary permission to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that all changed on Wednesday when the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/13/pharmacists-must-dispense-plan-b/"&gt;U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decided to lift the injunction&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore putting this whole silly issue to bed by insisting that pharmacists must fill the prescriptions for the drug regardless of how they feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the Friendly Atheist says it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the pharmacists have a right to practice their religion, but not at the expense of someone else’s health. A woman shouldn’t have to suffer because some pharmacists can’t do their job properly. If they are opposed to dealing with contraceptives, they’re in the wrong line of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They 2 men were not even kissing on the lips but on the cheek, though of course this is besides the point. Despite doing nothing wrong, they were cited by police for trespassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Painted Lady migrates from Africa all the way to Britain and northern Europe.  I suspect Nesbit’s work is related to further elaboration on this &lt;a href="http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;amp;cpsidt=18986195"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, that described two layers of migration: One at the ground level, relatively independent of wind movement, and another at very high altitudes, where prevailing winds would move the butterflies without much effort very great distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nesbit works in the Chapman lab, which has done a great deal of work on butterfly migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/worldonthemove/reports/butterfly-navigation/"&gt;Interview with Chapman by BBC&lt;/a&gt; about Painted Lady migration&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The painted lady is a globally distributed species, and you can find them in the US.  You can help report Painted Lady migration in the US via a &lt;a href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~mariposa/Vanessaproject.htm"&gt;Citizen Science project&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;

As it turns out, I have a lot more to say -- so much that I'm breaking it up into three posts so I can keep my trains of thought from colliding.  I'm going to start here with a post about the public's end of the scientist-public communication project.  Next, I'll respond to some of the claims the book seems to be making about the new media landscape (including the blogosphere).  Finally, I'll take up the much discussed issue of the book's treatment of the science-religion culture wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never fear, I'll intersperse these posts with some that have nothing to do with the book, or the framing wars.  Also, there will be new sprog art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tensions I noticed within &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;  has to do with who bears responsibility for the American public's disengagement with science.  Do we blame scientists who have been so immersed in doing science that they haven't made much conscious effort to communicate with members of society at large?  Wretched science teachers?  The American people themselves for being too dumb or lazy or easily distracted to "get" science and why they should care?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, actually I wish I had a G-rated version of the shirt to wear. I don't generally wear T shirts with profanity on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If such a shirt existed, then all I would need to complete my wardrobe would be this one:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/i_wish_id_had_this_t_shirt_at_tam7.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/i_wish_id_had_this_t_shirt_at_tam7.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/09Cy8RSnZmE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247546015094"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e510ea86fa3e792</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">London Calling</title><published>2009-07-14T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/london.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">About Michelle Obama's tour of London with her daughters.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247545688783"><id gr:original-id="http://kelvinthroop.wordpress.com/?p=117">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5c3ac6a45b89b84f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">New Disorders</title><published>2009-07-13T21:05:05Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T21:05:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://kelvinthroop.wordpress.com/2009/07/13/new-disorders-2/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">[BPSDB]In his excellent book “Bad Science”, one of Ben Goldacre’s targets is the medicalising of social issues by both the pharmaceutical giants and the alternative pill peddlers.

This should make sense since planets are thought to have rocky cores and you can't have a rocky core without heavy elements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what happens when &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...442..635B"&gt;a study of low mass stars&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby galaxy shows that all the M class stars are metal &lt;i&gt;poor&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously something is seriously wrong. There's two ways this could be taken: Either the study is wrong, or our theory of planetary formation has a major flaw in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to the disappointment of young Earthers, it's much more likely that the study. The reason is that for M class stars, finding accurate metallicity is not an easy task. To understand why, let's take a look at the ways we measure metal content of stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most accurate method is via &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2006/07/astronomical-data-3c-spectroscopy.html"&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;. This method is accurate because you can get the relative strengths of all the elements present by looking at the depth of their absorption lines. That's very nifty since the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity#Calculation"&gt;way we calculate metallicity&lt;/a&gt; relies on those ratios.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the difficulty with all spectroscopy is that it must be performed on each star individually, unlike &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2008/05/3e-1-photometry-basics.html"&gt;photometry&lt;/a&gt; which allows for quicker data, but with larger errors without careful calibration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, there exist photometric methods by which we can determine metal content. In the photometry I talked about in the post I just linked to, the filters used are carefully selected to avoid as many of the absorption lines as possible to get accurate measurements of the blackbody spectrum. However, if we instead choose filters to &lt;i&gt;hit&lt;/i&gt; the pits of these absorption lines for the elements we're interested in, we can use those to determine our metallicity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble is that for small, cool stars, like the M class stars in question, there's &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of absorption lines. In fact, there's so many, there's almost no distinguishable continuum. Lines can overlap which makes spectroscopy, let alone photometry, exceptionally difficult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help try to improve things, the authors of the study used the fact that there's a relation between how much metal a star has and how much it's moved off the main sequence (metals tend to make a star slightly redder and scoot it right on the HR diagram). Piecing this together with photometric data, they argued that they had reliable metallicity estimates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, a &lt;a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0004-637X/699/2/933"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; is suggesting that the estimates may not be so reliable after all. It tested the older study to see if it could accurately estimate the metallicity of several stars for which they had higher quality measurements. The new study found the old significantly underestimated the metallicity!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whew! Planetary formation theory is safe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Astronomy+and+Astrophysics&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1051%2F0004-6361%3A20053046&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Metallicity+of+M+dwarfs&amp;amp;rft.issn=0004-6361&amp;amp;rft.date=2005&amp;amp;rft.volume=442&amp;amp;rft.issue=2&amp;amp;rft.spage=635&amp;amp;rft.epage=642&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edpsciences.org%2F10.1051%2F0004-6361%3A20053046&amp;amp;rft.au=Bonfils%2C+X.&amp;amp;rft.au=Delfosse%2C+X.&amp;amp;rft.au=Udry%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Santos%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Forveille%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=S%C3%A9gransan%2C+D.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Astronomy"&gt;Bonfils, X., Delfosse, X., Udry, S., Santos, N., Forveille, T., &amp;amp; Ségransan, D.

&lt;p&gt; Sorry for the slowness of the blog; I fell behind in writing my book, which is on a rather strict schedule, and until I got close to catching up, I didn't have time to do the research
necessary to write the next chaos article. (And no one has sent me any particularly
interesting bad math, so I haven't had anything to use for a quick rip.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Anyway... Where we left off last was talking about attractors. The natural question
is, why do we really care about attractors when we're talking about chaos? That's a question
which has two different answers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/strange_attractors_and_the_str.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/07/strange_attractors_and_the_str.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/6a6JYNwVFBY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247540481823"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_tabouli_craving.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/938b1657c091d40e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pregnancy"/><title type="html">The Tabouli Craving</title><published>2009-07-14T03:14:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-14T03:14:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/s2XOOTw6lts/the_tabouli_craving.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/the_tabouli_craving.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amanda, who is pregnant, claims to have had no food aversions and she claims to have no food cravings.

(Prady responded that Sheldon does origami -- "obviously" -- just not during the show.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The entire conference was a celebration of a motto perhaps best encapsulated by TV's Gregory House (sadly &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; at TAM-7): "Trust me -- it's way cooler to know."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/-0H0r2Xqlgs%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3036070768804518015-637019822025584?l=blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This should make sense since planets are thought to have rocky cores and you can't have a rocky core without heavy elements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what happens when &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005A%26A...442..635B"&gt;a study of low mass stars&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby galaxy shows that all the M class stars are metal &lt;i&gt;poor&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously something is seriously wrong. There's two ways this could be taken: Either the study is wrong, or our theory of planetary formation has a major flaw in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to the disappointment of young Earthers, it's much more likely that the study. The reason is that for M class stars, finding accurate metallicity is not an easy task. To understand why, let's take a look at the ways we measure metal content of stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most accurate method is via &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2006/07/astronomical-data-3c-spectroscopy.html"&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;. This method is accurate because you can get the relative strengths of all the elements present by looking at the depth of their absorption lines. That's very nifty since the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity#Calculation"&gt;way we calculate metallicity&lt;/a&gt; relies on those ratios.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the difficulty with all spectroscopy is that it must be performed on each star individually, unlike &lt;a href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/2008/05/3e-1-photometry-basics.html"&gt;photometry&lt;/a&gt; which allows for quicker data, but with larger errors without careful calibration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, there exist photometric methods by which we can determine metal content. In the photometry I talked about in the post I just linked to, the filters used are carefully selected to avoid as many of the absorption lines as possible to get accurate measurements of the blackbody spectrum. However, if we instead choose filters to &lt;i&gt;hit&lt;/i&gt; the pits of these absorption lines for the elements we're interested in, we can use those to determine our metallicity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble is that for small, cool stars, like the M class stars in question, there's &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of absorption lines. In fact, there's so many, there's almost no distinguishable continuum. Lines can overlap which makes spectroscopy, let alone photometry, exceptionally difficult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help try to improve things, the authors of the study used the fact that there's a relation between how much metal a star has and how much it's moved off the main sequence (metals tend to make a star slightly redder and scoot it right on the HR diagram). Piecing this together with photometric data, they argued that they had reliable metallicity estimates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, a &lt;a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0004-637X/699/2/933"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; is suggesting that the estimates may not be so reliable after all. It tested the older study to see if it could accurately estimate the metallicity of several stars for which they had higher quality measurements. The new study found the old significantly underestimated the metallicity!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whew! Planetary formation theory is safe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Astronomy+and+Astrophysics&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1051%2F0004-6361%3A20053046&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Metallicity+of+M+dwarfs&amp;amp;rft.issn=0004-6361&amp;amp;rft.date=2005&amp;amp;rft.volume=442&amp;amp;rft.issue=2&amp;amp;rft.spage=635&amp;amp;rft.epage=642&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edpsciences.org%2F10.1051%2F0004-6361%3A20053046&amp;amp;rft.au=Bonfils%2C+X.&amp;amp;rft.au=Delfosse%2C+X.&amp;amp;rft.au=Udry%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Santos%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Forveille%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=S%C3%A9gransan%2C+D.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Astronomy"&gt;Bonfils, X., Delfosse, X., Udry, S., Santos, N., Forveille, T., &amp;amp; Ségransan, D.

It isn't easy. Keeping your feet on the bottom is enough of a task, and you would probably need a weight belt to take an underwater stroll. Hippos (&lt;i&gt;Hippopotamus amphibius&lt;/i&gt;), though, walk and even prance along the bottom of lakes and rivers with ease. How do they do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When compared to a whale or even a manatee (the latter of which I will address a bit later on) a hippo does not look especially well-adapted to life in the water. It has a low, squat body and lacks a broad tail, flippers, or any other broad surface to help propel itself through the water. Neither is this amphibious mammal well-suited to quick movements on land. Hippos can trot a bit, but they are so cumbersome that while walking on dry land they always keep three of their feet in contact with the ground at a time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/07/pezosiren_walking_under_the_wa.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2009/07/pezosiren_walking_under_the_wa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/mTGk/~4/RRJ6TNLh6oU" height="1" width="1"&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

Surfactants are used in a variety of industrial applications including detergents and wetting agents. A number of widely used surfactants are problematic in that they are non-biodegradable and toxic. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFOA"&gt; PFOA &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanesulfonic_acid"&gt;PFOS &lt;/a&gt;are perfluorinated compounds (all hydrogens replaced with fluorines) – the fluorines make the compounds very good surfactants, but also very unreactive (and not biodegradable).  They are also known carcinogens. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_lauryl_sulfate"&gt; SDS &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_lauryl_ether_sulfate"&gt;SLES &lt;/a&gt;are not so bad, but still they are irritants and contain sulfonate groups that make them not as easily biodegradable as other compounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZoHHoUVFBn8/SlqDVOaPnYI/AAAAAAAAAJI/oSykxlNMZAs/s1600-h/surfactants.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:320px;height:118px" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ZoHHoUVFBn8/SlqDVOaPnYI/AAAAAAAAAJI/oSykxlNMZAs/s320/surfactants.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article describes the synthesis of an alternative surfactant that is both more biologically friendly (non-toxic and biodegradable) and uses “green” chemistry methods that improve the efficiency of the synthesis and reduce hazardous waste products.  N-Acyl palmitoyl ethanolamine is derived from two common constituents of  biological lipids: the fatty acid palmitic acid and ethanolamine.  Like soap, this surfactant is cheap, non-toxic and biodegradable.  Like many industrial surfactants, and unlike soap, it is not prone to forming soap scum with hard water.&lt;/p&gt;They used the enzyme &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipase"&gt;Lipase&lt;/a&gt; to catalyze the reaction between ethanolamine and a fatty acid (or its ethyl ester).  There are two possible products depending on which end of the ethanolamine reacts:  either a hydroxy amide or an amino ester.  Perhaps not too surprisingly, the hydroxy amide is formed exclusively.  Amides are generally more stable than esters, amines are stronger nucleophiles than alcohols, and as the authors point out themselves amino esters with only two carbons between the N and O will rearrange on their own to the more stable amide form.  Lipase was chosen because it is a flexible catalyst and the reaction takes place under mild conditions (no strong acids or bases to neutralize at the end).&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ZoHHoUVFBn8/SlqDJ7Y1qQI/AAAAAAAAAJA/4ypm3e25DHE/s1600-h/lipase2.png"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:320px;height:161px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ZoHHoUVFBn8/SlqDJ7Y1qQI/AAAAAAAAAJA/4ypm3e25DHE/s320/lipase2.png" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;They investigated three different sets of reaction conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;reactants in solution, conventional heat source&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reactants in solution, microwave heating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reactants in solid state, microwave heating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enzyme itself was attached to porous resin beads.  For the solution-phase experiments, the enzyme and reactants were added to dioxane.  For the solid-phase experiment, the reactants were dissolved in a small amount of solvent which was added to the enzyme and then evaporated to leave the reactants as a film on the enzyme-containing beads.  Both microwave-heated reactions went considerably faster than conventional heating, and the solid-phase reaction was faster that the solution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly makes this "green?" While dioxane is not the most desirable solvent, it can be recovered afterwards and re-used.  Otherwise, there is little waste.  If fatty acids are used as the starting material instead of the corresponding ester there are no waste byproducts (such as ethanol) to separate and dispose of safely, and no strong acids or bases to neutralize.  Even the enzyme is re-usable.  And the product hydroxy amide is of low toxicity and should be biodegradable as well.  If the solid-phase reaction with microwave heating turns out to be practical, it would greatly improve the efficiency of the process by speeding-up the reaction and improving the yield and purity of the products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Beilstein+Journal+of+Organic+Chemistry&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.3762%2Fbjoc.5.10&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=N-acylation+of+ethanolamine+using+lipase%3A+a+chemoselective+catalyst.&amp;amp;rft.issn=1860-5397&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=5&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beilstein-journals.org%2Fbjoc%2Fcontent%2F5%2F1%2F10&amp;amp;rft.au=Kidwai%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Poddar%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Mothsra%2C+P.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Chemistry%2COrganic+Chemistry%2C+Green+Chemistry"&gt;Kidwai, M., Poddar, R., &amp;amp; Mothsra, P.

Mr. Wade,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be an ordinary complaint from a non-believer, but every time I have had to stay in hospital for more than an hour, a “patient advocate” comes into my room and wants to pray with or for me, or leaves me with some sweet religious phrase or blessing in addition to asking me if there is anything I need. Some of these patient advocates wear crucifixes and I “believe” that a crucifix is a symbol of torture which I prefer not to see just before I have any medical procedure for which I will be unconscious. I guess they don’t read the pre admittance paper work I signed where I have marked “NONE” on religious preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I was waiting in my hospital room to be taken to surgery for my mastectomy, a patient advocate came in where I was talking to my husband and son and barged into a most personal moment in my life. A significant body part was to be removed from my chest and I was going through some emotional grief of my own with my family. Then I had to interrupt my private moment to be polite and deal with someone who was sure I needed the help of a supernatural source for my comfort. All I needed that day was my family and a competent surgeon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very tolerant of religious people because I was born, raised and have lived most of my life in the Bible Belt and understand the social and familial bonds associated with deep seated religious beliefs. Everybody feels comfortable if everyone is on the same chapter and verse in the family bible. Even when I lived in Lancaster/Palmdale, CA, I encountered a religious “patient advocate” when I had my appendix taken out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I want to see a “humanist” counselor to talk about life after my mastectomy, I don’t know how to find one in a state where there is a church on every corner. Maybe there should be an online e-counselor for those of us who need a professional not a confessional. Got any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An e-patient looking for an e-counselor…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear e-patient,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very glad that you are interested in getting counseling following your mastectomy.  It is not just the loss of a body part.  For most women, it is an assault on their femininity, their sexuality, their self confidence and their relationship with their partner.   Far too many women go through this trauma and then try to adjust, cope, or “deal with it” all on their own, pretending that they are “fine” and swallowing all of their grief.  This can lead to depression, to tension-related illnesses, and to very degraded relationships with their loved ones, especially their sexual partners.  Their husbands or partners have their own difficult feelings about it all, but, wanting to be supportive, and seeing their wives being “just fine,” they also swallow their feelings, and the communications spiral down into a suppressed charade where everyone is showing a false front.  Then the unexpressed grief and pain, which don’t magically go away, may leak out as anger over unrelated things, and the relationships deteriorate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counseling can prevent this and can even strengthen and improve your bond with your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding appropriate counseling can be a challenge in some parts of the country, especially rural areas, but your persistence will probably pay off.  Here are some basic steps to take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, see if your health insurance covers counseling or psychotherapy, and if so, to what extent.  There may be limits on the number of sessions and the amount that the insurance will pay.  There may be specific provisions for post-mastectomy patients, but if not, your need is very legitimate, and is worth whatever it takes to get your need fulfilled.   If your insurance will not cover it, don’t give up, just look for less expensive resources.  A counselor who doesn’t cost much is not necessarily a bad one, just as a very expensive counselor is not necessarily a good one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a referral to an appropriate therapist starting with the easiest sources first.  Start with your surgeon and your family doctor.  Ask them if they can refer you to a counselor who is experienced with post-mastectomy issues.  Don’t be shy about specifying that you want regular, secular, humanistic counseling, rather than any kind of pastoral counseling. See yourself as &lt;strong&gt;the customer,&lt;/strong&gt; rather than a helpless sick person. You have every right to be picky about what you want.  Even in places where there are “churches on every corner,” competent, well-trained secular therapists do exist.  If your doctors cannot provide such referrals, then possibly ask the hospital social worker for referrals.  Even though the patient advocates there seem to be mostly religious, the social workers may have the information you need.  Again, assertively stipulate the kind of counseling you want, and what you don’t want.  If that resource fails, ask trusted friends and after that, use the phone book or the internet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this issue, I recommend finding a face-to-face counselor rather than an online counselor.  The emotional power behind this loss can be enormous, and the therapist can much more easily read your emotional cues and respond to your needs if you are there in the room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you first call a therapist, be a savvy consumer and have all your questions written down in front of you.  Ask about their license to practice counseling.  They should have professional licenses granted by your state which require advanced degrees in counseling psychology and several years of supervised intern experience.  These licenses include Marriage and Family Therapist, Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Licensed Professional Counselor, Licensed Psychological Associate and Clinical Psychologist. If you need a cheaper therapist, an intern can do a good job counseling you, while getting supervision about your case from one of these licensed therapists.  They each have their own emphasis, but their training qualifies them to provide basic emotional support and relationship guidance.  If you can, obtain any fliers, literature or online information they have about their services.  That might help you to see what kind of counseling they provide, i.e. secular instead of pastoral.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is essential, essential, &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; that your husband participate in the counseling sessions.  He is very much affected by this, but he may think that he has no right to express his feelings when he’s supposed to only be supportive of you.  The therapist can referee your communication together, giving permission to say what’s weighing on your hearts.  Rather than just having your marriage survive this, your relationship can end up being stronger, closer and more nurturing than before.   It usually takes a few sessions to establish a trusting, comfortable rapport between the two of you and the therapist.  Your mutual interaction is a skill that all three of you are learning.  The more frank and straight forward you can be about how you feel toward your therapist, the sooner you can “get down to brass tacks” and start the healing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One more valuable resource that you could use in addition to counseling is a mastectomy support group.  The internet can help you to find one, either with actual meetings or online forums.  The dialogue with others who share your experiences can be very encouraging and validating.  They usually welcome the spouses as well as the women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you find what you need to continue your healing, both inside and out.   I admire your willingness and wisdom to seek counseling, given the foolish, ignorant attitudes that many people have toward psychotherapy.  There is no reason for anyone to feel embarrassed or ashamed about giving themselves the best care and the most thorough recovery.  You deserve it.&lt;br&gt;

We love to press the limits of nature: to cool things down as close as possible to absolute zero, to raise energies as high as possible, and to speed them up as fast as possible.  But when it comes to speed, there's an absolute limit: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light"&gt;the speed of light in vacuum&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relativity tells us &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; this is the absolute limit: the faster you want to go, the more energy it takes.  But, as you get close to the speed of light, you effectively increase the mass of your speedy particle, which makes it ever harder to accelerate it.  In fact, it would take &lt;b&gt;an infinite amount of energy&lt;/b&gt; to get even a tiny, massive particle (like an electron) to &lt;i&gt;reach&lt;/i&gt; the speed of light, much less exceed it.  The fastest we've ever made an electron go on Earth is &lt;b&gt;299,792457.9968 m/s&lt;/b&gt;, just a few &lt;i&gt;millimeters per second&lt;/i&gt; slower than the speed of light.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/what_happens_when_things_go_to/LEP_tunnel.jpeg" width="498" alt="LEP_tunnel.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) was set up to collide protons, it was called LEP, the Large Electron-Positron collider, and it achieved these speeds.  By comparison, light &lt;i&gt;in air&lt;/i&gt; is only 99.97% the speed of light in vacuum, or hundreds of &lt;i&gt;kilometers per second&lt;/i&gt; slower than the speed of light in vacuum.  What happens when a bunch of electrons, moving at &lt;b&gt;almost&lt;/b&gt; the speed of light in vacuum, suddenly enter the air?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/what_happens_when_things_go_to/cerenkov.jpg" width="500" alt="cerenkov.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation"&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt;, known to physicists as Čerenkov radiation.  What causes this?  Nothing can move faster than the speed of light in vacuum, but &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; can move faster than light in any material &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; than vacuum!  As soon as this speedy particle enters this "slower-than-vacuum" medium, the medium turns on the brakes.  All the charged particles (protons and electrons) that make up the medium interact with the delinquent speeder, and cause it to lose energy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/what_happens_when_things_go_to/bremsstrahlung.jpg" width="307" height="290" alt="bremsstrahlung.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, energy translates into photons -- or particles of light -- getting spit out.  The diagram above shows one photon; in reality, light gets spit out in all directions, and it gets spit out &lt;i&gt;perpendicular&lt;/i&gt; to the direction of motion.  When you continue traveling through the medium, you wind up with a cone-shaped beam of light:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/what_happens_when_things_go_to/378px-Cherenkov.svg.png" width="500" alt="378px-Cherenkov.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you continue to emit it until you find yourself back in a vacuum again or you slow down to a velocity below the speed of light in that material.  Why should you care?  Because all you need to build a high-speed particle detector is &lt;b&gt;a tank of water!&lt;/b&gt;  In water, the speed of light is down to about 3/4 of light in vacuum, so even something as simple as radioactive metals will emit tiny amounts of blue light if you put them next to water.  This is incredibly useful to scientists looking for fast-moving particles or rapidly moving decay products.  Just build a tank of water and put some blue-light detectors around the edge.  When something goes too fast, you see this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/Super_Kamiokande_Neutrino_Event.png" width="500" alt="kamiokande"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that, you've tricked this elusive particle into showing you all of its secrets!  (And that's how &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe.php"&gt;we find astrophysical neutrinos&lt;/a&gt;, for you fans of the little guy.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/what_happens_when_things_go_to.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247529152435"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-8932395352026854071">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/10d10a333b0602b8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Story of Suzie</title><published>2009-07-13T23:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T23:45:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/PwM79-xJiSY/story-of-suzie.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/8932395352026854071/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=8932395352026854071" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/07/story-of-suzie.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/7izNfVx7Guo%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-8932395352026854071?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vatican lauded the latest Harry Potter film on Monday, saying Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince made the age-old debate over good vs. evil crystal clear.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, crystal clear?  I read the book, and I’m pretty sure that the battle between good and evil was anything but &lt;a href="http://thehogshead.org/dumbledores-mercy-why-draco-couldnt-pull-the-trigger/"&gt;crystal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snape%20kills%20dumbledore"&gt;clear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it’s possible that the movie changes all those parts.  But I’m guessing it’s a reasonably faithful adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that the Vatican must be referring to their own idiosyncratic notions of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, perhaps they consider Dumbledore “&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2336409320070423"&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt;” on account of his support for &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/oct/21/film.books"&gt;gay marriage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://theblueboar.blogspot.com/2007/08/regina-doman-on-question-of-euthanasia.html"&gt;euthanasia&lt;/a&gt;.  And maybe they consider Voldemort “good” because his pursuit of horcruxes demonstrates that (unlike those nasty Darwinist muggles) he believes in an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horcrux#Description"&gt;immortal soul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the priests are merely using moral language to disguise an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases"&gt;affinity&lt;/a&gt; for watching horny teenagers:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Vatican newspaper &lt;i&gt;L’Osservatore Romano&lt;/i&gt; even gave two thumbs up to the film’s treatment of adolescent love, saying it achieved the “correct balance” and made the stars more credible to the general audience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247526321504"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/laugh_and_be_happy">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f745a80c6fb168d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Laugh and Be Happy</title><published>2009-07-13T23:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T23:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/laugh_and_be_happy" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joc67/848830642/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1300/848830642_6d73494e33_m.jpg" alt="a middle aged woman in a big floppy hat sitting cross-legged and laughing hugely.  there are some indistinct items (cloth in boxes?) in the foreground" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Apparently there are two types of laughter--laughter as an unconscious expression of joy, and laughter as a conscious expression of social information.  Guess which one &lt;a href="http://www.ithaca.edu/intercom/article.php/20090626101749125"&gt;an Ithaca study&lt;/a&gt; found autistic children &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/culture/090708-different-laughter.html"&gt;do much more of&lt;/a&gt;?  The good news for us is that people prefer listening to the unconscious, spontaneous type of laugher that many of us on the spectrum excel at.  Spontaneous laughter is the sound of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the happiness topic, a &lt;a href="http://www.unc.edu/peplab/research.html"&gt;University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill study&lt;/a&gt; is all about how short, frequent &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090708184544.htm"&gt;moments of happiness lead to resiliency and well-being&lt;/a&gt;, that, as quoted from researcher &lt;a href="http://www.unc.edu/peplab/barb_fredrickson_page.html"&gt;Barbara Fredrickson&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those small moments let positive emotions blossom, and that helps us become more open. That openness then helps us build resources that can help us rebound better from adversity and stress, ward off depression and continue to grow." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...The study helps show that to be happy, people do not need to adopt a "Pollyanna-ish" approach and deny the upsetting aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Wong, the New York Times correspondent who has been keeping us so well informed about the events as they unfold, told me that the NYT had&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"received an email from a reader saying the NYT should change its 'pronouncer' on Uighurs.  Right now, in our articles, the editors insert (WEE-gurs) as the pronouncer.  One reader said this is not the correct pronunciation, and sounds strange to the Turkic speaker’s ear." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I told Ed, it would have been helpful if the person who sent the NYT the e-mail would have indicated the correct pronunciation, not just told them that WEE-gurs sounds wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to clarify how the most important  Xinjiang names are actually pronounced in Uyghur and in Mandarin, I here provide various orthographic forms along with audio clips.  As to what sort of "pronouncers" should be developed for the major media, presumably to represent appropriate Americanized pronunciations, I invite suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: I give "pronouncers" and recordings of suggested American English renditions in a later post, "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1579"&gt;American English pronunciation of Uyghur proper nouns&lt;/a&gt;", 7/15/2009.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The names are read first in Uyghur and then followed by their Mandarin versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Uyghur — Wei2wu2′er3     維吾爾 ／维吾尔      ئۇيغۇر&lt;br&gt;
Variant romanizations of the Turkic include Uighur, Uigur, and Uygur.  I prefer Uyghur as being closest to the Perso-Arabic orthography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;2. Ürümchi — Wu1lu3mu4qi2 烏魯木齊／乌鲁木齐   ئۈرۈمچی&lt;br&gt;
Variant romanizations of this Uyghur word for the capital of the region include Urumchi, Urumtsi, and Ürümqi.  The latter is the official cartographic spelling in China; it's a combination of Turkic and pinyin.
&lt;hr&gt;3. Täklimakan — Ta3ke4la1ma3gan1 塔克拉瑪干／塔克拉玛干   تەكلىماكان&lt;br&gt;
Variants:  Taklimakan, Taklamakan. This is the huge desert that occupies most of southern Xinjiang; it is one of the largest and most arid deserts in the world.
&lt;hr&gt;4. Tarim — Ta3li3mu4 塔里木   تارىم&lt;br&gt;
The name of the basin in which the Täklimakan Desert sits.
&lt;hr&gt;5. Tarim River (Daryasi) — Ta3li3mu4 He2 塔里木河   تارىم دەرياسى&lt;br&gt;
The long river flowing along the northern edge of the Täklimakan Desert from which the Tarim Basin derives its name.
&lt;hr&gt;6. Kashgar — Ka1shi2ka1′er3  喀什喀爾／喀什喀尔   قەشقەر&lt;br&gt;
Variant:  Qäshqär.  The large oasis city at the far western edge of the region that is famous for its Sunday bazaar, the largest mosque in China, and other important monuments.
&lt;hr&gt;7. A shortened Mandarin version of no. 6.
&lt;hr&gt;8. Tängri Tagh — Tian1 Shan1 天山   تەڭرىتاغ&lt;br&gt;
Variant:  Tien Shan.  The Celestial / Heavenly Mountains that divide the northern part of the region from the south.
&lt;hr&gt;While it cannot be expected that this post will instantaneously clear up all the confusion surrounding the pronunciation of proper nouns related to the situation in Eastern Central Asia (recall how hard it was just to deal with Beijing last year during the Olympics:  "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=502"&gt;How they say 'Beijing' in Beijing&lt;/a&gt;"), I hope that it might serve as a reference for those who strive for accuracy.
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, Xinjiang (Xin1jiang1 新疆) means "New Borders," "New Territories," or "New Frontier," and is the name that was given to the region after it was subdued by the Manchus in 1884 and incorporated into the empire of the Qing Dynasty.  To avoid using politically sensitive names such as East Turkestan or Uyghurstan, I refer to the region by the purely geographical designation as "Eastern Central Asia."&lt;/p&gt;

Here's my reply to their reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We didn't get personal, and we didn't attack atheism in general!&lt;/b&gt; Hmmm. Here&amp;#39;s a sampling of what they do say: &amp;quot;Myers&amp;#39; actions were incredibly destructive and unnecessary&amp;quot;. I &amp;quot;set the cause backward&amp;quot;. New Atheists believe that &amp;quot;religious faith should not be benignly tolerated&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot; are &amp;quot;nasty bullying&amp;quot;. They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;shrill&amp;quot;. In last year&amp;#39;s voting for best science blog, I was the &amp;quot;devil&amp;#39;s choice&amp;quot;. Blogging brings out the &amp;quot;loud, angry, nasty, and profanity-spewing minority&amp;quot;. When he refers to Pharyngula, he refers to it as a &amp;quot;science&amp;quot; blog — in quotes. It&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;most alienating&amp;quot; of the blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can call it just "criticism". But the peculiarity here is that the only people he targets are me particularly, and "New Atheists" in general. If you're making an objective case for a genuine problem, just hammering on &lt;i&gt;one example&lt;/i&gt; is peculiar. If I'm representative, you'd think he'd marshal lots of examples; if I'm an outlier, he's building a case on an exception. Which is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the biggest problem here is the &lt;i&gt;uselessness&lt;/i&gt; of the critique, that word I used before to summarize his whole book. He provides no solutions in chapter 8, other than a general complaint that the "New Atheists" are bad. What does he propose to do about Pharyngula? Shut it down? Others will take its place. He doesn't seem capable of recognizing that it is popular because it fills a popular niche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Myers doesn't grasp our point about Pluto!&lt;/b&gt; This is true. I don't. I spelled out my complaints about this section in my previous review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, Chris and Sheril, what should the astronomers have done? Should they have had a binding referendum delivered to the public to get their say? Are there other scientific matters that should be decided by popular vote? (Let's put the truth of evolutionary biology up for decision in a poll!) Should scientists take the time to explain with a little wit and humor and sound scientific reasoning why they made that decision? If so, they missed the boat: they should read Neil deGrasse Tyson's &lt;i&gt;The Pluto Files&lt;/i&gt; for exactly that. How about some discussion about exactly why they think that failed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those questions have been ignored. The &lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/excerpt.php"&gt;Pluto section of the book&lt;/a&gt; is available online, go ahead and look. You won't find them saying &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; about what ought to be done in the future, or where the astronomers went wrong. Again, &lt;i&gt;useless&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Myers fails to say what the point of the whole book was!&lt;/b&gt; Exactly. What is it? I said the first chapter was symptomatic, and it was. Mooney and Kirshenbaum grumble about those insensitive scientists and those uppity atheists, but their proposals are either absent or so general as to be pointless, like…let&amp;#39;s give more media training to scientists! I agree that would be a good idea, but it&amp;#39;s not going to resolve any of the issues they are so bitter about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they really think that will address their complaints? I've had no media training at all. Imagine how nuts it would drive Mooney if I were slick and polished and skilled at using a variety of media, because it wouldn't change my message at all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Richard Dawkins is no Carl Sagan!&lt;/b&gt; Nope, he's different. Woo hoo. So? That's just the thing: we are not going to clone Carl Sagan, or raise him as a zombie. What we're going to have is a collection of voices: a Dawkins, an Attenborough, a Tyson, a Suzuki, a Miller, and many others, all with different tones, different emphases. My objection here is that instead of diversity, Mooney and Kirshenbaum appear to want only one voice, and it's got to be one that is conciliatory and deferential to religion and the public opinion in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I am unimpressed — they seem to think that &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; am a significant problem here, which misses the point. They're supposedly writing about an American problem of a lack of scientific literacy. If they think I'm the root (or perhaps, the flower, even) of the problem, you can tell that they're going off on the wrong track already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, &lt;i&gt;they don't answer the questions about the substance of their book&lt;/i&gt;. What next? Where are the answers in their book? If they really want to dig into the substance of the solutions they provide, they should try &lt;a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2841"&gt;answering Ophelia Benson's questions&lt;/a&gt;. I predict he won't even try; they're much harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this whole exchange illustrates the failure of Mooney/Kirshenbaum's arguments. The demotion of Pluto, the rise of the "New Atheism", PZ Myers, and blogging are all &lt;i&gt;recent phenomena&lt;/i&gt; — they do not deal with the causes of the disconnect between society and science, and treating them is a distraction from dealing with the real problems. This book is more like a collection of poor rationalizations for complaining about stuff they don&amp;#39;t like than a serious and scholarly attempt to address a significant social problem. To useless, I must also add the adjective lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I do have to wonder if they are going to feel compelled to make a reply to my reply to their reply to my review. And how are they going to cope with other critical reviews that will be coming down the pipeline? This could get fun!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reanimation of the undead is, it would seem, a rather addictive behavior, because HuffPo just keeps at it.  Another one of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/the_fake_experts_of_huffpo.php"&gt;their fake experts&lt;/a&gt; is "Dr" John Neustadt.  The scare quotes indicate that John is not a doctor in any recognized sense: he's a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/04/naturopathy---a_final_word.php"&gt;"naturopathic doctor"&lt;/a&gt;, representing a fringe, vitalistic health cult.  But that fact isn't made clear.  He's presented as "Dr" so that we might assume that he is the real deal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the latter, but health officials seem interested in the developing data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090713/swine_090713/20090713?hub=Health"&gt;CTV&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... in a report released Friday, health officials detailed the cases of 10 Michigan patients who were very sick from swine flu in late May and early June and ended up at a specialized hospital in Ann Arbor. Three of them died.

&lt;p&gt;Nine of the 10 were either obese or extremely obese. Only three of the 10 had other health problems. Two of the three that died had no other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hardly settles the question of whether obesity is its own risk factor for swine flu. It's possible the patients had undiagnosed heart problems or other unidentified conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is called &lt;em&gt;Intensive-Care Patients With Severe Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection --- Michigan, June 2009&lt;/em&gt; and is published in MMWR, the CDC's rapid turnaround publication for disease.  The report warns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This report describes the clinical findings of a limited series of patients with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and refractory ARDS  .... This patient group represents the most severely ill subset of persons with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and is notable for the predominance of males, the high prevalence of obesity (especially extreme obesity), and the frequency of clinically significant pulmonary emboli and MODS. All required advanced mechanical ventilator support, reflecting severe pulmonary damage. The pulmonary compromise described in this report suggests that severe pulmonary damage occurred as a result of primary viral pneumonia. Although data are not available, this damage also might be attributable to secondary host immune responses (e.g., through cytokine dysregulation triggered by high viral replication). However, bacterial coinfection in the lung not identified by blood culture or bronchoalveolar lavage cannot be excluded.

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high prevalence of obesity in this case series is striking. Whether obesity is an independent risk factor for severe complications of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is unknown. Obesity has not been identified previously as a risk factor for severe complications of seasonal influenza. ....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further characterization of severe cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in the United States and worldwide is needed to determine the frequency of the findings from this limited case-series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0710a1.htm"&gt;You can read the report here. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is very preliminary and I suspect that this will not develop.  In other words, I suspect that existing poor health related to the cardiopulmonary system is a serious risk factor with any flu.  But we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="padding-left:10px" title="Sen. Jeff Sessions" src="http://www.asipp.org/images/sessions_hires_000.jpg" alt="" width="157" height="210" align="right"&gt;I’ve been watching the confirmation hearing for Justice &lt;strong&gt;Sonia Sotomayor&lt;/strong&gt;.  It’s of particular interest to the Secular Coalition because she’ll be replacing Justice &lt;strong&gt;David Souter&lt;/strong&gt;, who was one of the staunchest defenders of the separation of church and state, but we don’t know her views.  We &lt;a href="http://secular.org/news/Sotomayer_Letter.html"&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; to the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee urging them to bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I wasn’t really watching the speeches per se, I was more sort of listening while CSPAN was in another tab.  I perked up when I heard someone mentioning prayer.  Turns out it was &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Jeff Sessions&lt;/strong&gt; (R-AL).  I tracked down his &lt;a href="http://sessions.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressShop.NewsReleases&amp;amp;ContentRecord_id=748b6f9f-9c33-8369-5205-b6eb2429d3db"&gt;prepared statement&lt;/a&gt;, and it turns out to have been this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have seen federal judges force their own political and social agenda on the nation, dictating that the words “under God” be removed from the Pledge of Allegiance[2] and barring students from even silent prayer in schools.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m dying to know what those footmarks are, because can’t find them actually citing anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding [2], I assume he’s referring to &lt;strong&gt;Newdow’s&lt;/strong&gt; famous case against Elk Grove.  It’s a bit of a stretch too say that their interpretation of the Establishment Clause is “forcing their own political and social agenda on the nation”, but at least I know what he’s talking about.  I think he’s wrong, but he’s in this version of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on [3], I really have no idea what he’s talking about.  I certainly haven’t heard of any cases of federal judges “barring students from even silent prayer in schools.”  Know why?  Because there are none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My co-worker Mary made a good point to illustrate how false it must be: how would they enforce it?  I can just envision a teacher saying “You!  You look thoughtful and distant!  You’d better be daydreaming and not praying!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.  This is just another example of people spreading misinformation about “those scary atheists”.  Except that this time it’s a senator making public comments on record.  Senator Sessions has a background in law, so one would expect him not to misrepresent court cases.  Wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jesse Galef</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Friendly Atheist</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247522710579"><id gr:original-id="http://artksthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/07/earliest-eumetazoan-progression.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/27c95bede0d4a3bf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">The Earliest Eumetazoan Progression</title><published>2009-07-13T16:53:29Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T16:53:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/MlcbfboVQBk/earliest-eumetazoan-progression.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://artksthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/07/earliest-eumetazoan-progression.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have commented several times on the early evolution of the animals, especially in regard to their ability to handle information.   Here I want to look at the progression from a plausible common ancestor of the latest-branching &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade"&gt;clade&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponges"&gt;sponges&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumetazoan"&gt;Eumetazoans&lt;/a&gt; to the point of a plausible last common ancestor of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctenophores"&gt;Ctenophores&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidarians"&gt;Cnidarians&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilaterians"&gt;Bilaterians&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Symmetry and Development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since, in my view, all (or most) of the animals in the sequence we're looking at had biradial &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry"&gt;symmetry&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#39;ll start with a discussion of that.  (Especially since Wiki has only a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology#Biradial_symmetry"&gt;stub&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, as I've &lt;a href="http://artksthoughts.blogspot.com/2009/05/serching-for-ubilaterian.html#symmetry514"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; before, symmetry in all animals that move in response to external directional cues must be superficial.  Even if the animal is only a sphere with sensory cells and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciliated"&gt;ciliated&lt;/a&gt; swimming cells distributed evenly over its surface, the communications needed to coordinate its swimming with the direction of threats and food will require each cell to know its location relative to the whole.  There can be no confusion between left and right, front and back, top and bottom.  This requires a coordinate system of some sort, even if the physical &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)"&gt;morphology&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t show it.  For a spherical surface, there are two obvious options:  radial (or angular) and multipolar.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The radial system is like the system of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude_and_longitude"&gt;latitude and longitude&lt;/a&gt;:  it starts with a pair of poles on opposite sides of the sphere, which we will call &amp;quot;oral and &amp;quot;aboral&amp;quot;, named after the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastopore"&gt;blastopore&lt;/a&gt; or (single) gut opening in these early animals.  (Sponge larvae also demonstrate this polarity in their distribution of cell types, although they lack a blastopore.)    A line between the poles (along the surface -- one through the center of the sphere is the axis) is then defined as the &amp;quot;zero longitude&amp;quot; line, after which any spot on the spherical surface may be uniquely located by its angular location relative to the poles (latitude), and its angular location relative to the &amp;quot;zero longitude&amp;quot; line.  Of course, it will still have to know clockwise from counter-clockwise:  30° longitude is very different from -30°.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The multipolar system also starts out with a polar axis, but then goes on to define another (which might roughly correspond to 0° and 180° longitude) and then yet another (which might correspond to 90° and 270°).  any location on the spherical surface is uniquely defined by three numbers:  how far it is between each of the three pairs of poles.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Controlling the Development of Symmetry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, location in animals is almost always defined in terms of the diffusion of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_molecules"&gt;signaling molecules&lt;/a&gt;, a system well supported by a good epithelium.  The tight junctions among all the superficial cells prevents these molecules from diffusing out into the surrounding medium, and the basal layer(s) can be specialized to allow much faster diffusion along than across it.  The first set of poles, then, can define &amp;quot;latitude&amp;quot; with a cluster of cells at one end releasing a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"&gt;diffusible&lt;/a&gt; signal:  latitude is known by the concentration of the signal.  &lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A more robust mechanism would have cells at the other end also releasing a signaling chemical, a different one.  Now a cell on the surface could get its latitude by sampling the relative concentrations of two chemical signals.  This is a typical system in some developing embryos, although the oral signal usually comes from a ring of cells surrounding the blastopore.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we try to use such a mechanism in the radial coordinate system, the &amp;quot;zero longitude&amp;quot; line would have to emit its signal in only one direction (or two signals, each in one direction), or else it would be impossible to distinguish clockwise from counter-clockwise.  (Alternatively, a separate signal could be released at a point some angle away from the &amp;quot;zero longitude&amp;quot; line, but this is becoming a hybrid with the multipolar system.)  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The multipolar system has this problem solved, at the cost of three signals (or pairs of signal chemicals).  this is, in effect, what &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilaterians"&gt;bilaterians&lt;/a&gt; all use, and IMO it&amp;#39;s likely that research will eventually discover that the Ctenophores and Cnidarians do as well.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With all this in hand, let&amp;#39;s look at symmetry.  Since the Cnidarian &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medusa_(biology)"&gt;medusa&lt;/a&gt; forms have a well-defined radial symmetry around their oral/aboral axis, we&amp;#39;ll start with that.  If we imagine a glove with poles, latitude, longitude, and an equator, let&amp;#39;s break the equator into four equal sections, broken at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°.  We&amp;#39;ll define a primary mirror image at each break line, so each section looks identical to its reflection in each mirror.  We&amp;#39;ll also define a second set of mirrors intermediate to the the first, at 45°-225° and 135°-315°.  Each section, then, is identical to every other, and to its reflection across the primary mirror line.  Each section&amp;#39;s halves are also identical but inverted across the secondary mirror line running down its middle.  This is radial symmetry with an index of four.  A simple square has this sort of symmetry.  It can be divided into four identical sections, reflected in  the two mirror axes, with each section having identical but inverted &amp;quot;left&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; halves.  Note that if you divide a square into eight sections, four of them will be inverted relative to the others.  Note also that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter which set of axes you define as primary, and which secondary:  a square can be divided into four sides (sharing corners) or four corners (each with two half-sides).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, many Cnidarians have a higher index than four, such as eight, or sixteen.  It&amp;#39;s easy to see how these body plans can be achieved developmentally.  for instance, if we start with an index of four, at each point where one of the primary planes of symmetry (reflection) intersects the equator (or some other circle of equal &amp;quot;latitude&amp;quot;), there&amp;#39;s a small patch of cells emitting a chemical signal.  For robustness, there should be another patch at each point where a secondary plane intersects, emitting another chemical.  By sampling this signal, any cell can know where it is within the section it occupies.  Note that for coordinated control, each arm, at least, will have to know its location relative to the entire organism&amp;#39;s coordinate system.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does a developing organism double its index?   At a specific point in development, a signal is released telling the cells at the secondary points to begin emitting the primary signal (instead of the secondary), and a group of cells halfway between each set (who already knew their position from the earlier signals) begin emitting the secondary signal.  Now the index is eight.  this process can be repeated as many times as needed, and it&amp;#39;s a simple mutation to increase (or decrease) the number of repeats.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&amp;#39;ve described how the multipolar system could produce four poles equally distributed around the equator, if a patch of cells at each of these poles started emitting the primary signal, and cells that found themselves at the midpoints began emitting the secondary signal, you&amp;#39;ve got radial symmetry with an index of four.  But more interesting is how those four poles came to be.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with a simple sphere with no coordinate system except a single patch of cells (somewhere, anywhere on the surface).  If these cells begin emitting a signal (different from the signals used in radial symmetry), it will diffuse around the sphere while breaking down and diffusing away (at right angles to the surface, which is presumably an epithelium capable of controlling the diffusion rates in different directions).  Thus the concentration will reduce from a maximum at the emitting pole to a minimum at its &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes"&gt;antipode&lt;/a&gt;.  Cells are capable of detecting a concentration gradient, the fact that there is none is enough to let cells at the antipode know that they should begin emitting the opposite signal.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More problematical is the next pole.  Some mechanism is needed to select this pole (somewhere on the equator), various species use various methods, some of which are essentially random.  Once this pole is selected, cells here may begin emitting a new signal (still probably different from those used in radial symmetry), which diff...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="background-color:#eee;padding:6px;font-size:11px"&gt;

"The world has spent years learning how to help autistic children. Now, those children are growing up."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the description prefacing a July 12 &lt;a href="http://www.app.com/article/20090712/NEWS/90712026/1001/rss"&gt;Arizona Republic&lt;/a&gt; article (via the &lt;a href="http://www.app.com/article/20090712/NEWS/90712026/1001/rss"&gt;Asbury Park Press&lt;/a&gt;). The article's title is "&lt;a href="http://www.app.com/article/20090712/NEWS/90712026/1001/rss"&gt;Children of autism approach adult world&lt;/a&gt;" and it makes the point that &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autism_isnt_only_for_children"&gt;autism isn't only for children&lt;/a&gt;, despite what many an autism organization's marketing campaign might tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the past 20 years, we've been talking about how horrific autism is.....And now we are saying that we need these young people to live with you. To be in society."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;says Denise Resnik, whose 18-year-old son, Matthew, is autistic. Resnik is a co-founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.autismcenter.org/"&gt;Southwest Autism Research &amp;amp; Resource Center&lt;/a&gt; (SARRC). I can't agree more with her words: Talking about an "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_epidemic_question"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;" and the "horrors, awfulness, nightmare," etc. of life with an autism does get attention, but (aside from making people feel sorry that one is autistic and that one has an autistic child), it doesn't help the public perception of autism, or public attitudes about having autistic individuals living in the community, in group homes or support apartments or other situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARRC's employment division has trained some 100 adults on the spectrum, with 25 placed in jobs. Matt McMahon owns 18 Outback Steakhouse franchises. His 12-year-old son is autistic and he's committed to having at least one adult on the spectrum working at each franchise. Erin Onacki  helps to train individuals for jobs and notes that other people need training to learn "&lt;a href="http://www.app.com/article/20090712/NEWS/90712026/1001/rss"&gt;how to work alongside the autistic &lt;/a&gt;"; as Resnik also says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to do this.........Autism does not go away, and neither do the people living with it. We have to learn how to live together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past week my son's been rearranging the furniture in our living room. He moved one couch back under the window where it had originally been and then, yesterday morning, started moving around the two (quite heavy) pieces of another black couch. We'll rearrange things eventually (there's a bit of an obstacle course right now to get into our kitchen) but Jim and I have been sitting down wherever the furniture is. We've gotten some different views of the house and of things with the new arrangement---yet another change made by Charlie in our lives that's brought us a new perspective and that we've learned to accommodate ourselves to and that works, in a different way. (And gives Charlie a large empty space to gambol in at one end of the living room.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just that individuals with disabilities need to learn what to do in the workplace. The rest of us also need to do things differently and change the workplace---the world---ourselves. As Resnik said, "'&lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; have to learn to live &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;"---my emphasis on "we" and "together" added---and ss Dora wrote, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/autistic_adults_are_not_large_children"&gt;autistic adults are not large children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the only person tagged to interview Danish psychic/dowser Connie Sonne at TAM7 yesterday, I was given an extraordinary chance to be a part or parapsychological history in the making. To those who may doubt our veracity, we have now gone a long way to showing clearly what we do as serious investigators. Those people who spout claims and contentions that have bogged down so many arguments with cries of bias or poor conditions have now been made aware that as scientific seekers, we do things right. Along with the JREF staff, Banachek, Randi and dozens of others who worked so hard to make everything as fair and transparent as humanly possible, we stand united as a force to be reckoned with.  Big media can take this demonstration of clear thinking as a warning: &lt;strong&gt;We are a growing movement.&lt;/strong&gt; The train has already left the station and if Anderson Cooper or Fox Television execs don’t want to climb on board, they miss this train at their own peril.  We are becoming stronger. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over 1,700 in attendance or listening in one way or another during the first live test of Connie Sonne, I was struck by not only the huge crowd, but also the solemnity and respectful atmosphere that presided. The pre-show Muzak was appropriately funereal. I have never been in a room full of that many people and seen such rapt attention. Even at a piano concert at the L.A. Philharmonic, you can usually count on a cough or a titter now and then. With this group, you could have literally heard a pin drop. It was an amazing testament to just how single-minded a conference room full of skeptical non-believers could be. I dare say that even a few of the thousand assembled might have been in some way mentally rooting for Connie to win or score some significant record for her trouble. She didn’t. Asked to dowse for cards 3 1 7, Connie Sonne dowsed 2 5 2.  None of the randomly chosen targets were hit and there was no wiggle room for discrepancies. It was a wash. Poor Connie. Nonetheless she held her head high and managed to wade through a barrage of not-so-subtle questioning during the after-test briefing. She still emerged to deal with my interview with nary a feather ruffled. I will forever remember the look on Phil Plait’s face as he sat right next to Connie as she made her rather strained but still confident statements to the press. It was the kind of look one cannot help but make when you are in close proximity to a bag of rotting fish. You are the greatest Phil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="Pen &amp;amp; Edward" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Pen-Edward-225x168.jpg" alt="Penn &amp;amp; Edward" width="225" height="168"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn &amp;amp; Edward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the test itself, I felt in the presence of some of the most powerful minds of my time arranged alongside me in our close to the stage “V.I.P.” seating set up. It’s moments like these that I know I’m doing something right. Luminaries included but were not limited to such experts as: founding member of C.S.I.C.O.P., Ray Hyman, Penn Jillette, Teller, Randi and JamyIan Swiss, …. the list goes on and on. Without wanting to name drop every person there, it was truly a historic event by any standard. The entire project can be seen in the live stream at &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/1BmU3E"&gt;http://bit.ly/1BmU3E&lt;/a&gt;.  Go to the JREF website and read the protocols and procedure. I won’t go into all that either, because for my money, it was my twenty minutes spent alone with Connie that told the real tale of how psychics can slip through even the tightest controls, lose the momentary fight, but still mange to come out on top, even if for the most part it’s only in their own minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Hyman-Edward1-225x168.jpg" alt="Hyman &amp;amp; Edward" width="225" height="168"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyman &amp;amp; Edward&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie lost the Million Dollar Challenge miserably, but her defence strategy was a refreshing blend of hubris and mild condescention mixed with pride. I was expecting the usual excuses of recent challenger babblers, but with Connie: she didn’t bother. She was confident and self-assured in the face of overwhelming criticism. One has to ask: why would she do this when even she herself admitted that right before she boarded the plane that was to take her to America to face JREF, she had “a premonition” that things were not going to work out?  She’s just plain crazy, right? I don’t think so. If she’s crazy, it’s like the proverbial fox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my taped interview, which will be published in an up-coming book  JREF press liason Bart Farkis is writing on the history of the Million Dollar Challenge, Connie showed a casual side that was as relaxed and easy-going as any person I had ever done a reading for. Perhaps it was her European continental attitude that struck me first. Her body language was languid and supple as she easily settled into her rap, cigarette cocked lounge-style in her hand. I opted  for a mirroring posture to attempt to get her to feel comfortable and thereby perhaps dig herself in even deeper. I felt that a “Good Cop” position as opposed to all the “Bad Cops” she had been dealing with all day long  might help loosen her tongue rather than taking a tougher line and chancing making her more defensive and possibly losing the chance to get a little closer to the “truth;’ whatever that may be in her case. I had previously used this ruse when I interviewed Rosemary Altea during the Penn &amp;amp; Teller show taping and it worked marvelously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She insisted that she lost merely because, “…it wasn’t time yet for my powers to be revealed.” She carefully avoided (and at one time almost fell into the trap of saying during the press briefing) the standard mediumistic line, “…there was negative energy in the room,” probably wisely noting to herself before uttering such a cliche that such a statement in the TAM environment would be a gross understatement. Hers was a novel approach that I could definitely relate to. In fact given half the chance I may one day use it myself,  although such wordage would be allocated to performance only usage. Not only was the world (and Randi &amp;amp; Co. particularly) “not ready” for her earth shattering prophecies and powers, but it came out later in the interview that whatever dark and ominous declarations would be forthcoming from her in the future, all of it was somehow tied into the whole “2012″ conspiracy. This is where she started to lose me. Too many of the old dodges turned into hybrid newage were popping up, with everything conveniently cloaked in contemporary woo-guise.  I liked Connie though. I have known many self -professed “psychics” and most have been totally unemployable, unperson-able and grotesque. I know I’m going out on a tenuous limb here by even slightly defending her stance, but at least she stuck to her guns and stayed focused only on her part in the fray. She continuously reminded me of up-coming world changes only she would be privy to and blamed no one for her failures of that afternoon. In her mind any failures or set-backs are only a part of a big picture puzzle that will one day coalesce. She gets a pass because she thinks in her mind that this failure was only a stepping stone that will lead her to where she is supposed to be down the line. Any tests using playing cards or dowsing are mere trifling and of no consequence when you are somehow involved with massive government cover-ups, world conquest or blessed with secret knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the sequence in “&lt;em&gt;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” &lt;/em&gt;(2008) where in a brilliantly edited series of flashbacks, we are shown that all things are connected and that a series of seemingly unconnected events or chain reactions results in the main female lead Daisy getting hit by a taxi, all things end up being miraculously serendipitous. Connie reminded me several times that, “….All things are connected, you see.” Eh, yeah. Of course I had to agree to keep up with her histrionics. When talking with her, I felt that at any moment she might spiral off into Illuminati or Bilderburger-land.  She again wiselystayed comfortably vague when it came to exactly who, where and why we could expert to hear from her in the future. She chided over and over, “…this &lt;em&gt;will happen,”&lt;/em&gt; referring to some eventual vindication of her nascent powers. Nice dodge somewhat akin to John Edward’s famous comment on my Penn &amp;amp; Teller Bullshit episode, &lt;em&gt;“Talking to the Dead,”&lt;/em&gt; when John the douchenozzle boldly stated: “I can be wrong and still be right.” Not at TAM you can’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="width:235px"&gt;&lt;img title="triangle" src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-content/uploads/triangle2-225x300.jpg" alt="Mark Edward performing the &amp;quot;Triangle of Doom&amp;quot; at the Skepchicks TAM party" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Edward performing the &amp;quot;Triangle of Doom&amp;quot; at the Skepchicks TAM party&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie was quite convincing in her diatribes that were obviously well rehearsed. Add in her overarching quest to find kidnapped media focus Madeleine McCann and insistence that she “…&lt;em&gt;will find her&lt;/em&gt;,” and you have one seriously dedicated (or deluded) person. She told me she has spent over $30,00 so far on this hunt (which borders on stalking if you ask me) which she has borrowed from her mother to finance trips to Portugal, the UK , France and the USA. She also admonished me that she wasn’t doing any of this “for the money” but admittedshe would like to pay her mother back and be able to pay her rent and sustain her bodily self. Thirty grand from one million dollars leaves a sizable residual amount for a nest egg. Enough to re-paint the trailer home she apparently occupies in northern Denmark anyway. After telling me about this semi-conspiratorial McCann kidnapping and it’s deep meaning to be revealed, including a warning that Madeleine is one of the “Chosen Ones,” I was beginning to feel like I was in some sequel to &lt;em&gt;“Children of Men”&lt;/em&gt;(2006; an award British sci-fi film where the birth of one single child in a dystopian world environment that has left all men sterile) and that there was no doubt Connie had copped much of her shtick from several popular contexts. Sorry for the film references here and there, but for me sometimes my excursions into woo-land take on surreal qualities that can only be compared to fictional cinematic quips that seem to fit. This also saves a lot of wordage and shows in a clearer fashion just how powerfully words and images can enter into the culture, strengthening and giving credence to often flawed philosophies and myths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any of Connie’s semi-altruistic sentiments rang hollow even as I kept striving to play the empathetic interviewer. Anyone who knows me knows that in most cases, I’m liable to give any credulous soul the benefit of the doubt unless they are clearlyun-hinged or beyond help. Connie skirted that borderline. Like I said, I liked Connie in some ways. Just like I may like any eccentric willing to stand up to society and be different and iconoclastic. I like the act that the homeless guy on the Metro train does when he takes out his glass eye and sings R&amp;amp; B too, but that doesn’t mean I would trust my future to him.  In the final analysis  and examination of hers claims of supernatural powers, Ms. Sonne fell far from the mark. Talk is cheap no matter whether it’s pitched here or in Denmark. I don’t think I’ll be watching for any pivotal news events delivered from the mouth of Connie Sonne. This whole merry dance should tell us all that even while bringing to the attention of the media her alleged “talents” in the manner of a full-fledged live televised test situation, we are also giving huge publicity to people who may not deserve one minute of our time. Don’t be surprised if you see Ms. Sonne appearing on Oprah or Larry King. She’s just the type the media will fall all over themselves to promote. We know better. We use science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict Ms. Sonne will be seen more than a few times in the next few weeks and I also predict that the believers out there in woo-world will be calling into account the excuse that having a mentalist like Banachek handling the cards and envelopes will be touted as a bias, contamination by association and the probable cause for Connie’s failure, &lt;em&gt;even if Connie herself  says to the contrary&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Taylor Swift song is stuck on repeat in my brain. If I flub this assay, I'm blaming her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got to thinking to myself, "I like Taylor Swift.  Sure, her videos are a tad cliche (then again, so is Twilight and I clearly don't mind it there), but she is an adorable little chicken.  Maybe I'll watch a video or two before I go to bust some skulls."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And watch I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it was while brushing my flowing auburn locks and watching a video for one of my favorite Taylor Swift songs that I noticed this:&lt;/p&gt;

Gaspar introduced his work by saying that these larvae may be very similar to the common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetric animals (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateria"&gt;Bilaterians&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbilaterian"&gt;Urbilaterian&lt;/a&gt;. The Urbilaterian being the last common ancestor of vertebrates and invertebrates, this would mean (and I have no reason to doubt) that we can learn a lot from the original state of that animal's nervous system. All of today's extant vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems must be some variation of this initial organization.&lt;br&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://nature.com/nature"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;paper entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7220/full/nature07590.html"&gt;Mechanism of phototaxis in marine zooplankton&lt;/a&gt;" (req. subscr.), Gaspar tells us the whole story in magnificent detail, full color and almost as fascinating and exciting as in his talk last year. These larvae are planktonic, moving around in the sea using a ring of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium"&gt;cilia&lt;/a&gt;, beating to propel the animals forward. In the early larval stage, they move towards the light (positive phototaxis), moving them away from the place where they hatched (dispersal). Later in their development, the become negatively phototactic. This behavior brings them back to the ocean floor, where they metamorphize into the adult worm (probably quite some ways away from the place where they first hatched).&lt;br&gt;The animals look sort of like an egg with hair (I'll refrain from alluding to any resemblance to living or fictional characters):&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://bjoern.brembs.net/e107_images/newspost_images/gaspar/taxis1.jpg" style="border:0px solid black;width:295px;height:294px" alt="taxis1" title="taxis1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;The larva also has two eyes on the bald spot above the 'hairs'.&lt;br&gt;It uses the cilia ("hairs") to generate a stream of water from front to back, propelling it through the water. Apparently, in the dark the animals move about randomly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://bjoern.brembs.net/e107_images/newspost_images/gaspar/taxis2.jpg" style="border:0px solid black;width:239px;height:176px" alt="taxis2" title="taxis2"&gt;&lt;br&gt;When there is a light source, the  two eyes of the larva can detect the direction from which the light is coming. The right eye detects light from the right and the left eye light from the left. Each eye has a shielding pigment to the center of the animal, to prevent light from the opposite direction from exciting the photoreceptor in each eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://bjoern.brembs.net/e107_images/newspost_images/gaspar/taxis3.jpg" style="border:0px solid black;width:251px;height:252px" alt="taxis2" title="taxis2"&gt;&lt;br&gt;The photoreceptor of each eye makes a direct, inhibitory &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"&gt;synaptic&lt;/a&gt; connection to the most nearby ciliated cells:&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://bjoern.brembs.net/e107_images/newspost_images/gaspar/taxis4.jpg" style="border:0px solid black;width:188px" alt="taxis4" title="taxis4"&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means that whenever the photoreceptor detects light, it will inhibit the ciliated cells nearby, causing the cilia to beat with a lower frequency. In the graph below, all the cells are numbered around the equator of the larva, with cells #6 and 7 being closest to the eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="http://bjoern.brembs.net/e107_images/newspost_images/gaspar/taxis5.jpg" style="border:0px solid black;width:290px;height:235px" alt="taxis5" title="taxis5"&gt;&lt;br&gt;As you can see, in the dark, the frequency of the cilia in beats per second is significantly higher close to the eye, compared to when light is being shone on the larva.&lt;br&gt;This reduction in ciliary frequency has the same effect as if you'd stop rowing on one side when you're on a lake, rowing: you turn towards the side where you stopped rowing. In much the same way, the larvae turn towards the light, by inhibiting the ongoing activity of the propelling cilia on the side on which there is light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaspar and his colleagues used a wide variety of methods including evolutionary biology, physiology, microscopy, behavioral biology and computer modelling to come to a truly astoundingly detauiled conclusion as to how these animals perform directed orientation maneuvers with very few nerve cells. The level of detail, sophistication and rigor is really exceptional in this publication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Superficially, what this fantastic work of science shows is how a stimulus (light) elicits a response (phototaxis) via sensorimotor processes. However, if you look at the physiology of how the larvae are actually performing the behavior, it becomes clear that this appearance is not supported by the data presented in this paper. &lt;em&gt;Platynereis&lt;/em&gt; larvae generate ongoing behavior even in the absence of light. If the experimenter, the rotation of the earth or their own behavior leads to activation of the eye(s) by light, this light-stimulus only modulates (in this particular case &lt;em&gt;inhibits&lt;/em&gt;) the behavior that was already present before any stimulation. Thus, the general organization of the Urbilaterian nervous system was not characterized by sensorimotor, but by motor-sensory processes. In the beginning was the behavior, dispersing the larvae. Only later, sensory processing started to provide an evolutionary advantage by modulating the behavior and directing the animal first towards light and then away from light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These results contrast with most neuroscientific research today which works under the assumption of the sensorimotor hypothesis, stating that the main function of brains is to produce behavior in response to sensory stimulation. This new research suggests that at least the ancestral state was the reverse: brains are generating behavior and then await the response of the environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Nature&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1038%2Fnature07590&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Mechanism+of+phototaxis+in+marine+zooplankton&amp;amp;rft.issn=0028-0836&amp;amp;rft.date=2008&amp;amp;rft.volume=456&amp;amp;rft.issue=7220&amp;amp;rft.spage=395&amp;amp;rft.epage=399&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fdoifinder%2F10.1038%2Fnature07590&amp;amp;rft.au=J%C3%A9kely%2C+G.&amp;amp;rft.au=Colombelli%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Hausen%2C+H.&amp;amp;rft.au=Guy%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Stelzer%2C+E.&amp;amp;rft.au=N%C3%A9d%C3%A9lec%2C+F.&amp;amp;rft.au=Arendt%2C+D.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CNeuroscience%2CBehavioral+Biology%2C+Ecology%2C+Evolutionary+Biology%2C+Genetics%2C+Zoology%2C+physiology"&gt;Jékely, G., Colombelli, J., Hausen, H., Guy, K., Stelzer, E., Nédélec, F., &amp;amp; Arendt, D.

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article6689482.ece"&gt;takes three steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hundreds of like-minded people have completed an “actus defectionis” or “declaration of defection” on the site since it went live last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have completed a three-step process that enables users to get the formal letter required by church officials to change baptism records and allow former followers officially to leave the faith. The document needs to be signed, witnessed and sent to the parish where the person was baptised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cormac Flynn, a 29-year-old website designer who describes himself as agnostic, linked up last month with Grainne O’Sullivan and Paul Dunbar to create the online campaign, which also runs on Facebook and Twitter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is a way to show your disapproval for the Church’s abuse/child-rape scandals, it may seem silly and frivolous to go through these motions.  It’s not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this important to do if you no longer consider yourself a Catholic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Formally defecting from the Catholic church also sends an “unambiguous message” that &lt;strong&gt;people with changed beliefs no longer wish to be included in head counts used to justify the church’s role in the state’s services&lt;/strong&gt;, the campaigners say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are many so-called lapsed Catholics as well as agnostics and atheists in Ireland but the church continues to count them as members,” said Dunbar. “Formally defecting will mean the church can no longer use their large membership to justify continued involvement in the provision of education and health services.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do formally leave, you can’t get married in the church or have your funeral there… but there are plenty of secular alternatives for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no minimum age requirement to do this, but the website suggests you be 18 before filling this out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 664 people have left the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will &lt;a href="http://www.countmeout.ie/"&gt;you be number 666&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br&gt;

It is also a common response to a painful experience. We've all done it: after stubbing our toe, or hitting our thumb with a hammer, we draw a sharp breath and mutter a swear word. Until now, though, whether swearing actually alters our perception of pain had not been investigated. But according to a new study due to be published next month in the journal &lt;em&gt;NeuroReport&lt;/em&gt;, swearing increases pain tolerance, enabling us to withstand at least one form of pain for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Some pain theorists regard our tendency to swear after hurting ourselves to be a form of "pain-related catastrophising" - an exaggerated negative mind set which is brought to bear during a painful experience. As such, swearing is thought of as a maladaptive response, which contributes to the intensity of the pain and emotional distress. Given that it is such a common response, &lt;a href="http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/ps/people/RStephens/index.htm"&gt;Richard Stephens&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues at the Keele University &lt;a href="http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/ps/psyhome.htm"&gt;School of Psychology&lt;/a&gt; set out test the hypothesis that swearing would decrease pain tolerance and increase pain perception.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mohsen Namjoo is very popular in Iran and has made a few concerts around the world including in North American cities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;This is further evidence of the government’s ongoing effort to clamp down on artists and musicians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Getting Personal? &lt;/strong&gt;Myers claims that our book contains “very direct and personal attacks on me and on Pharyngula, atheists in general, and anyone who fails to offer religion its proper modicum of respect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to know precisely what he means by “very direct and personal attacks,” as he doesn’t back up the charge with any evidence. Certainly we do directly mention Myers. We describe the infamous &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php"&gt;desecration of the communion wafer&lt;/a&gt;, which we criticize. Later, we also talk critically about Myers in the context of discussing the face of science on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if these constituted “personal attacks”–and we don’t see how–they still wouldn’t be attacks on “atheists in general, and anyone who fails to offer religion its proper modicum of respect.” Chris is an atheist. We’re quite sure he did not attack himself in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Myers, he is a very public figure, and never was he more public than in what he refers to as “Crackergate.” Does he not expect to be criticized when he puts a desecrated communion wafer on the Internet? Was everyone who criticized him on that occasion attacking him personally?&lt;/p&gt;

TAM was… extraordinary. I finally got to hug my friends that, until this weekend, were just compassionate avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to meet some of my skeptical heroes. Not just the big names like Phil Plait and James Randi (and I was a bridesmaid in a wedding with Adam Savage, if you hadn’t heard), but also some of my not-as-big names who are doing great things for skepticism and saving the world while I tweet about Moose eating crayons. It was humbling to finally meet the lovely (albeit frenzied) A Kovacs, who you probably know as A.Real.Girl, probably the hardest working person in skepticism today. And I very purposefully spent as much time as I could chatting with Joe Albietz, the PICU doctor responsible for the TAM vaccine drive. It was humbling, empowering, inspiring, and motivating. I am a better person today because I was at TAM last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from the “big names” out there, who are the people out there that you want to meet? Have you met any of your less prominent heroes? Who would you like to see get the recognition for their work in skeptical activism that isn’t yet getting the attention you think they deserve? Are there big name skeptics that you think, even with the amount of attention they currently get, are still under-appreciated by our community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247512140038"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13737">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9db5294601d3507c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Lawsuits"/><title type="html">NO GODS License Plate in Indiana is Approved!</title><published>2009-07-13T19:00:51Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T19:00:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/13/no-gods-license-plate-in-indiana-is-approved/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, I posted about &lt;strong&gt;Jason&lt;/strong&gt; from Indiana.  His request for a license plate reading NO GODS was &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/30/is-a-no-gods-license-plate-offensive/"&gt;rejected by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href="http://tcmso.blogspot.com/2009/07/almost-final-update-on-no-gods-license.html"&gt;good news to report&lt;/a&gt;!  Jason wrote this in an email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I got a letter on Friday stating that my initially rejected personalized license plate of “NO GODS” has now been approved…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may also be BMV code for “We don’t want to get sued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering several websites mentioned this story, the ACLU was about the get involved, and even CNN was considering doing a story, this seems like an obvious (but welcome) conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see the picture of the new plate &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ian O’Doherty&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/ian-odoherty/all-hail-the-tree-1818805.html"&gt;wrote this&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Irish Independent&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So, we’re now officially the most religiously deranged country in the civilised world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that blasphemous libel has been introduced to the statue books, it will be a crime to have a pop at religions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here we go — Catholicism is a cannibal cult which eats its leader, Jews who believe that God wants them to settle in the Holy Land are deranged lunatics, Muslims who wants to install Islamic law are nothing but fascist terrorists and Scientologists are nothing but a bunch of brainwashed weirdos who have been suckered by the malicious rantings of a failed science-fiction writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright lads, I’ll see you in court.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“One of the world’s most beautiful and best-loved countries, Ireland has recently become one of the most respected as well: dynamic, go-ahead, modern, civilised — a green and pleasant silicon valley. This preposterous blasphemy law puts all that respect at risk… It is a wretched, backward, uncivilised regression to the middle ages. Who was the bright spark who thought to besmirch the revered name of Ireland by proposing anything so stupid?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheist Ireland will be putting up their own &lt;a href="http://blasphemy.ie/"&gt;purposely blasphemous statement&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like these groups and newspapers ought to have a contest: &lt;strong&gt;What’s the shortest blasphemous statement you can make?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Komarnitsky's book keep coming in: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1441463305?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1441463305&amp;amp;adid=19RWHEYJ5904R9SMY75T&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doubting Jesus' Resurrection: What Happened in the Black Box?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; In it he lays out a probable naturalistic hypothesis of Christian origins. Here's what some scholars are saying about his book: &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“If you liked my book &lt;em&gt;Beyond Born Again&lt;/em&gt;, you're going to love this one by Kris Komarnitsky! He shows great acuity of judgment and clear-eyed perception of the issues. He does not claim to have proof of what happened at Christian origins, but he does present a powerfully plausible hypothesis for what might have happened, which is all you need to refute the fundamentalist’s claim that things can only have gone down their way. By now it is a mantra – it is also nonsense, and Kris shows that for a fact.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;–– Robert M. Price, Ph.D. Theology, Ph.D. New Testament&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“A surprisingly excellent demonstration of how belief in the resurrection of Jesus could plausibly have originated by natural means. Komarnitsky is well read in the leading scholarship on this issue and boils the debate down to bare essentials in plain language. He quotes and cites dozens of scholars and primary sources to build a solid case. Though I don't always agree with him, and some issues could be discussed at greater length, everything he argues is plausible, and his treatise as a whole is a must for anyone interested in the resurrection.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;–– Richard Carrier, Ph.D. Ancient History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Komarnitsky is addressing an important topic in a considered and rational way. This book offers the open-minded reader an opportunity to work through some of the key questions surrounding the Easter mystery that lies at the heart of Christian faith.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;–– Gregory C. Jenks, Ph.D. FaithFutures Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Clearly written and well argued, Doubting Jesus’ Resurrection lays out a plausible and intriguing case for a non-supernatural explanation of the New Testament resurrection accounts. Don’t be put off by the fact that Komarnitsky is not a scholar – his book makes a solid contribution to the historical-critical understanding of these immensely important texts. This book deserves serious attention from scholars and all those interested in Christian Origins.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;–– Robert J. Miller, Professor of Religious Studies, Juniata College.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Komarnitsky's third chapter he ventures onto my home turf--psychology--and his treatment of the the subject is impressive. I found the chapter opening a bit hard to follow, but persistence paid off in spades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Komarnitsky pulls together the work of historians and psychologists and tells story after story of apocalyptic cults that find ways to sustain their beliefs despite radical disappointments (a messianic figure betrays trust, an end-of-the-world date comes and goes, aliens fail to appear). Social psychologist Leon Festinger's work on cognitive dissonance provides a theoretical framework for understanding an otherwise incomprehensible phenomenon. For anyone who is interested in how apocalyptic beliefs are sustained, whether in a Christian context or not, I recommend this thorough, well-documented overview. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the Christian resurrection story is shrouded in mythos, making it hard to know what actually happened in history, modern examples and cognitive dissonance theory offer a compelling possible scenario. Without resorting to any form of supernaturalism, drawing just on what we know about human behavior, Komarnitsky offers a sufficient explanation for the resurrection story at the heart of Christian orthodoxy." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-- Valerie Tarico, Ph.D., Author: &lt;em&gt;The Dark Side - How Evangelical Teachings Corrupt Love and Truth &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2171050886082474419?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=fight+club"&gt;Fight Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In bad news for the residents, the actual &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/07/judge-rules-that-videos-of-texas.html"&gt;fight club videos are currently not being allowed as evidence&lt;/a&gt; in the trial.  This decision is currently under appeal.  The defense is asserting that the cell phone with the videos was stolen and illegally accessed by police; the prosecution is asserting that the cell phone was in fact abandoned in a public place (the story as it originally broke btw makes this assertion).  The trial will continue regardless of the outcome of the cell phone appeal, however the video is, obviously, a very strong piece of evidence for the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/aspies_psychos_stigma_anddonuts"&gt;Psycho Donuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On July 25 - 26, a representative each from Psycho Donuts and a mental health organization &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/07/mental-health-official-psycho-donuts.html"&gt;will discuss the issue of stigma on TV&lt;/a&gt;.  Some of the donuts are described in the &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/07/mental-health-official-psycho-donuts.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, and yeah, they are pretty offensive, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Should my friend, who suffered major head trauma after a drunken driver hit him two weeks ago, enjoy the doughnut M.H.T., for massive head trauma - a doughnut with an X for each eye, a frown and a smudge of red frosting on the side of the frosted face?" writes Stapleton [a staff writer for Palm Beach Post]. "I am not laughing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um.  Yeah.  Me neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Broadcast details: Channel 2 KTVU Saturday July 25 at 6:30 a.m.; KICU TV36 on Sunday July 26 at 9 a.m.; Comcast on Demand the week after July 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=hate+crimes+raymaker"&gt;Matthew Shepard Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Very soon, as early as this Wednesday, July 15, the &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/07/final-push-hate-crimes-legislation.html"&gt;Senate will vote on the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act&lt;/a&gt;.  This act has already passed in the House.  Now is the time to get loud and get personal--call or fax your Senators and urge them to support this very important piece of public health and safety legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=sotomayor"&gt;Judge Sotomayor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For anyone who is in a position to do so and is so inclined, a letter of support of Sotomayor to be signed by disability organizations is available.

Believe it or not, I was even on a panel! However, my flight was scheduled to arrive very late Sunday night, and I'm still recovering. Consequently, for one more day I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The other day, &lt;a href="http://surgeonsblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/body-talk.html"&gt;Sid Schwab&lt;/a&gt;, surgeon blogger extraordinaire, brought up a question that, I'm guessing, most nonsurgeons wonder about from time to time when contemplating how it is that we surgeons do what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about bathroom breaks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that most of the surgery that I do is breast surgery, my operations rarely take more than two or three hours. The only time a typical operation that I do takes longer than that is the uncommon times when I am doing a double mastectomy, and even then it's rarely more than a four hour affair. All I have to do is to make sure to hit the bathroom right before scrubbing, and I'm fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/iron_surgeon_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/iron_surgeon_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/oOmJ5tznhHc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247504466589"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8109">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78fd6644258cfd1b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Mailbag: Lentil-Burger Babies</title><published>2009-07-13T16:00:30Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T16:00:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8109" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, we received this letter in the Skepchick Mailbag. I was hoping to get it posted sooner, but I’ve been quite busy. I had &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8074"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://amazingmeeting.com/"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt; to go to and &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8100"&gt;a wedding&lt;/a&gt; to help plan (and keep secret) and parties to attend and &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7898"&gt;contests to judge &lt;/a&gt;and sleep to not get. Sorry for the delay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband, Danny, and I have decided it’s time to further the human&lt;br&gt;
race and make a baby or two.  Problem being, we are having trouble&lt;br&gt;
finding books, blogs, and other resources concerning pregnancy,&lt;br&gt;
parenting, and the enormity of creating an entire human being all by&lt;br&gt;
ourselves that aren’t completely lentil-burger.  I know you have&lt;br&gt;
recommended Dale McGowan as an author, but he is more about the&lt;br&gt;
“instilling values into your kids” and less about the “Oh my god, now&lt;br&gt;
I have to take this baby home and raise it what am I going to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any suggestions for an excited, but terrified, future&lt;br&gt;
budding family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;3—Teresa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for writing Teresa! I wish you all the best in your quest to procreate and parent. Being responsible for another human being – a mushy, fragile, blank slate, impressionable human being – is a big deal. It’s a scary endeavor. But here’s the good-ish news: knowing how scary it is and how important your role is as a parent is the first sign that you could possibly be really ready to parent! The bad news? Nothing prepares you to become a parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really want to do is give you a great Skepchick’s Official Guide® to being a great skeptical parent –  a point by point instructional on how to raise skeptical children. Unfortunately, kids don’t work that way. Skeptical or not, there is not a “right way” or “best way” to raise kids. Parenting skills are something you develop as you go along… and when you have another one, everything you thought you knew about raising a kid goes out the window because… you know, that’s how people work. We’re all very different, even from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can’t raise your children to become great critical thinkers. You can only offer them the tools. It’s up to them to decide whether to use them or not. There are great skeptical parents out there with great skeptical children. They aren’t out there by accident. How each of them does it, I don’t know. The best I can offer is a few tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“From &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, alright! I learned it by watching &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;!” &lt;/strong&gt;Live skeptically. Skepticism isn’t something you use now and then. It’s something you do all the time. For the first few years, most of what your kids learn comes from watching the people and things around them combined with their innate curiosity. Kids will try to repeat everything you do. Let them see you asking questions. Let them see you accept that you make mistakes. Be the example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t indoctrinate your children.&lt;/strong&gt; As veteran skeptics, we tend to dismiss some things before the question can even be asked (like when we already know the answer.) We know astrology is bullshit, and we don’t have to think much of it. However, it’s important to not teach our children that “astrology is bullshit.” Or that “ghosts don’t exist”. Instead, engage their sense of wonder. Rather than telling them things like “We don’t believe that”, ask them the questions that will help lead them to the answer. Tell them that astrology is a belief that stars affect how we are as individual people. Then ask them questions. Help them come to a conclusion, but don’t give them the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t dismiss their “silly questions”. You can guide them… show them how to find the answers to their questions. And reassure them that there’s nothing wrong with coming up with a different answer than they expected or even wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace change.&lt;/strong&gt; I think this is the one of the hardest things to do as a human being. We like it when things stay the same. We like our facts to remain facts. But many times, the things you and I learned as kids stop being facts. For some reason, we find this upsetting. In my state, Pluto is &lt;em&gt;legally&lt;/em&gt; a planet. WTF, Illinois? As if &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt; called all his &lt;em&gt;Astronomers in Charge of the Universe Club&lt;/em&gt; members and said, “Hey, wanna &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get people mad? Let’s get rid of Pluto!” And they all laughed and tapped their fingers together while everyone on Earth freaked out. There’s no reason to be emotionally attached to Pluto’s planet status other than the fact that we &lt;em&gt;just don’t like change&lt;/em&gt;.  Try to show your child that change = learning. Perhaps the change isn’t better, but the change has taught them something. And the change has taught you something as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let them explore.&lt;/strong&gt; If it’s not stupidly dangerous, let them do it. Sometimes this will get annoying – like when your toddler goes through his pulling everything out of drawers phase. Or when they have to push that same button for the 150&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; time just to see if it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; does the same thing when they push it. But you know what that is? That’s science! It’s the scientific method… don’t stifle that curiosity. At some point we seem to lose it, not completely, but as we grow, it fades significantly. There’s no reason to encourage less curiosity, is there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;vaccinate.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s no reason to let the potential great leaders of tomorrow die off from something stupid like whooping cough or tetanus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe your future skeplings will grow up to become great minds. Maybe they will grow up to become young earth creationists. You can’t force either one upon them or away from them. All you can do is guide them… the rest is up to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, Teresa!  Parenting is a frustrating, overwhelming, scary and, at times, thankless job… but one of the most rewarding things you’ll ever have the opportunity to experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247504337531"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/13/how-scientific-illiteracy-cost-us-20-years-on-global-warming/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09e15ad1171ec66f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Global Warming"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">How Scientific Illiteracy Cost Us 20 Years on Global Warming</title><published>2009-07-13T16:34:51Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T16:34:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/13/how-scientific-illiteracy-cost-us-20-years-on-global-warming/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The popular website Buzzflash.com has &lt;a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/store/items/1745"&gt;added &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt; to its premiums&lt;/a&gt;–where you can buy the book and also throw in a donation to Buzzflash–and now they’ve also run a &lt;a href="http://blog.buzzflash.com/contributors/2019"&gt;commentary piece&lt;/a&gt; by us, setting our failure to act on climate in the context of the continuing gap between science and society. An excerpt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate issue is the most powerful — and also the most catastrophic — example of how our society dysfunctionally managed matters of science. The stakes are literally enormous: We’re threatened with an unrecognizably changed planet, many of its largest cities submerged. The science is extraordinarily clear: It goes all the way back to 1859, when the Irish scientist John Tyndall first described the nature of the greenhouse effect. In modern times, meanwhile, the issue has been on the agenda for fully two decades now. Yet still, only about half of the public follows or trusts scientists on the matter. And so nothing has happened politically, and the problem has had all those years to steadily worsen — and even if we do get a global warming law for the first time in 2009, in a sense we’ve already failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So perhaps we ought to ask, what could we possibly have done differently?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the idea. Thank god for ctrl + copy so I didn’t have to type the word “penguin” as often as he said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex has a collection of toy jungle animals and some sea birds. Perhaps because we went to the Central Park Zoo last weekend and visited the &lt;a href="http://www.centralparkzoo.com/plan-your-trip/exhibits/polar-circle.aspx"&gt;Penguin House &lt;/a&gt;there, he started to really want a penguin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was easily solved with a trip to &lt;a href="http://www.fao.com/stores.html#new-york"&gt;FAO Schwarz&lt;/a&gt;. A great thing about New York City is the number of &lt;a href="http://gocitykids.parentsconnect.com/parents-picks/new-york-ny-usa/best-new-york-city-toy-store"&gt; toy stores&lt;/a&gt;. I honestly think you are never more than a 15-minute walk from a pretty good toy store in most parts of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex was &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;happy&lt;/span&gt; delighted with the penguin. And we were &lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;relieved &lt;/span&gt;overjoyed not to have to hear him ask Penguin? nonstop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The image below, as &lt;a href="http://www.einsteinstelescope.com/author.html"&gt;Evalyn Gates&lt;/a&gt; explains, is a perfect example.  Evalyn is an astronomer at the University of Chicago, and the author of a great new book on the science of gravitational lensing, &lt;a href="http://www.einsteinstelescope.com/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Einstein’s Telescope:  The Hunt for Dark Matter and Dark Energy in the Universe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Einsteins-Telescope-Matter-Energy-Universe/dp/0393062384"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Einsteins-Telescope/Evalyn-Gates/e/9780393062380/"&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780393062380-2"&gt;Powell’s&lt;/a&gt;).  This post is an introduction to how gravitational lensing gives us some of the most visually arresting and scientifically informative images in all of astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of meeting up with Sean and some other old friends at the World Science Festival in NYC last month, and over champagne at the opening night reception (science has its benefits) Sean graciously invited me to write a guest post on gravitational lensing.  It’s a broad topic, mainly because lensing is proving to be such an incredibly useful tool for many areas of cosmology and astronomy, but I have to admit that the visual beauty of the images produced by lensing is part of the appeal for me.&lt;br&gt;
I’m also enamored of the visceral connection between these images and lensing phenomena that all of us encounter in daily life – and the access into a complex theory that this connection affords. The giant arcs, Einstein Rings, and multiple copies of a single distant galaxy or quasar that have now been observed in hundreds of images are concrete visualizations of otherwise abstract concepts of general relativity – they effectively trace out the warps in spacetime created by massive objects, revealing the outline of the cosmos much as the technique of “rubbing” can reveal the writing on an ancient gravestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image, from a recent &lt;a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0906.5079"&gt;paper by Adi Zitrin and Tom Broadhurst &lt;/a&gt; is both scientifically and visually irresistible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/0906.5079"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/07/zitrinbroadhurstfigure1.jpg" alt="zitrinbroadhurstfigure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the image itself is really cool.  The bright white/yellow galaxies are members of a cluster known as MACS J1149.5+2223, while the blue amoeba-like objects that appear to be invading the cluster are actually five images of a single distant (&lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; ~ 1) spiral galaxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This galaxy has been lensed by the warp in spacetime created by the cluster.  Light from the galaxy, which lies almost directly behind the center of the cluster but much farther away from us, travels along several curved paths through the cluster lens, producing multiple magnified images of the galaxy. The inset box shows a computer generated model of the &lt;i&gt;unlensed&lt;/i&gt; source galaxy, enlarged by a factor of four so that the details, including the spiral arm structure, are visible.  Without the lensing power of the cluster, we would see this galaxy as a single small blue smudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, lensing will both magnify and distort (shear) images of a background source. This lens is fairly unique in that we see large but relatively intact images of the spiral galaxy, which implies that the mass distribution in the central region of the cluster must be nearly uniform. The images in the upper left (#1) and lower right (#2) are especially striking.  #1 is magnified but very minimally distorted, while #2, the largest image with a magnification of over 80, seems to be curling its tentacles about one of the galaxies in the cluster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A close look also reveals the negative parity (mirror symmetry) of the remaining three images – the spiral arms appear to circle in the opposite direction – as expected from lensing.  The total magnification of the distant galaxy (the sum of all five images) is about 200, the largest known to date – supporting the authors’s claim that this is “the more powerful lens yet discovered.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember how pissed off you were because who the $#&amp;amp;% are they to decide what’s best for women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists in Washington state had filed a lawsuit so they wouldn’t have to do their job and fill those orders.  A district court agreed and granted them a temporary injunction saying they wouldn’t have to fill those prescriptions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-pill-ruling9-2009jul09,0,6469894.story"&gt;decided to lift the injunction&lt;/a&gt;.  Those pharmacists can no longer withhold the pill from customers.  Hallelujah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The three 9th Circuit judges found common ground despite differing outlooks: Two conservatives named to the court by President George W. Bush and a liberal named by President Clinton made up the panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right to freely exercise one’s religion “does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability,” the 9th Circuit panel wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any refusal to dispense — regardless of whether it is motivated by religion, morals, conscience, ethics, discriminatory prejudices, or personal distaste for a patient — violates the rules,” the panel said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, you can read the &lt;a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/07/08/07-36039.pdf"&gt;actual decision here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the pharmacists have a right to practice their religion, but not at the expense of someone else’s health.  A woman shouldn’t have to suffer because some pharmacists can’t do their job properly.  If they are opposed to dealing with contraceptives, they’re in the wrong line of work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I, as a vegetarian, worked at Subway but refused to make sandwiches with meat on them because that went against my Jain religion, I would rightfully be fired.  The bigger question, though, would be why I decided to take that job in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

But that's not what I hear in the media; &lt;a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/unpersons/"&gt;for some reason&lt;/a&gt; the most outspoken economists are the anti-stimulus folks. And so I did &lt;a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/07/09/pm_stimulus/"&gt;a short piece&lt;/a&gt; for Public Radio's &lt;em&gt;Marketplace&lt;/em&gt; yesterday on the need for more fiscal stimulus.

We&amp;#39;re going on 7 August, and on that very same day, they are planning to present…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:center;font-size:36px;font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blaghag.blogspot.com/2009/07/creation-museum-trip-just-got-better.html"&gt;THE ULTIMATE PROOF OF CREATION!!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the Ultimate Proof of Creation, you might ask?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a defense for creation that is powerful, conclusive, and has no true rebuttal. As such, it is an irrefutable argument--an "ultimate proof" of the Christian worldview. This presentation will equip you to engage an unbeliever, even a staunch atheist, using proven techniques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy crap! It's a trap! I'm going to be bringing along a whole mob of young atheists from the Secular Student Alliance, and this speaker, &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/events/bio.aspx?Speaker_ID=40"&gt;Jason Lisle&lt;/a&gt;, is going to be like Darth Vader among the younglings. I might be able to put up a fight against Emperor Ham, just like Samuel Jackson, but then his apprentice will show up and zap, blam, zowee, I'll be chopped up and blown out a window. We're doomed. DOOOOOOOMED.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I insist on being informed before going to my ignominious fate. The &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/PublicStore/pdfs/SampleChapter/10-2-363.pdf"&gt;first chapter of the Ultimate Proof of Creation&lt;/a&gt; is available online, so I read it cautiously, fearing that I would see science demolished with an irrefutable argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thing is complete garbage. It's the same old routine that Answers in Genesis always trots out: "We're using the same evidence," they say, "only we're just interpreting it differently. We're just as sciencey as you are!" Only they aren't. They're leaving out all the evidence that contradicts their views, and twisting the bits they want in inappropriate ways. And then they make stuff up! Here's an approach I've been seeing a lot from creationists lately: they invent scientific "laws" and then declare that evolution is unscientific because it violates those "laws". The most common one is the so-called "law of biogenesis" that dictates that life can only come from other life, but here's a pair that Lisle pulls out of his butt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no known law of nature, no known process, and no 
known sequence of events that can cause information to originate by itself in matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When its progress along the chain of transmission events is 
traced backward, every piece of information leads to a mental 
source, the mind of the sender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are quite simply false. Chance can generate new information in genetics, so we know the first law is bogus, and since we can trace a useful piece of genetic information back to unguided mutations, we know the second is yet more baloney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I'm too worried about the Ultimate Proof of Creation anymore. I suspect it is going to be more like &lt;a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;amp;id=1576"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I know there are many people who wanted to attend but could not, so for you I will point out that this year the JREF experimented with &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/jref-office"&gt;Ustreaming part of the conference&lt;/a&gt;. So you can get a dose of TAM skeptical goodness from the comfort of your computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I must say, for me the best part of these meetings is just being in a room with a thousand skeptics, some of whom are friends that I only get to see once or twice a year, including my fellow Skeptologists. There is also an energy to live meetings that, in my opinion, cannot be matched online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also struck me this year that many attendees approached me to ask what they can do to contribute to our efforts and the skeptical movement as a whole. They feel the energy of this growing movement and want to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Fortunately, Daniel Loxton, editor of Junior Skeptic, has already taken the time to answer this question. He wrote a book called “&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhatDoIDoNext.pdf"&gt;What Do I Do Next?&lt;/a&gt;” which includes 101 ways to contribute to the skeptical movement. He interviewed many activist skeptics and included their answers in his list of what skeptics can do. They include many obvious answers – like organize a local skeptical meet-up group or help an existing one, start a blog or (if you are ambitious) a podcast, investigate some local paranormal claims and report on them, and you can send an e-mail of support to skeptologists@newrule.com saying you want this kind of skeptical content on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some not-so-obvious answers – like organize a group tour of a science museum. Perhaps the most challenging answer Daniel gives is to explore new frontiers for skepticism. Find new ways that no one has thought of yet to spread appreciation for science and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to consider what it is you enjoy doing and where your skills and talents lie. If you can do anything, chances are there is someone or some organization in the skeptical movement that can use your skills. We need computer programmers, graphic designers, artists, writers, experts in every scholarly field, journalists, teachers, marketing and PR experts, fundraisers, grant writers – any many more. This blog and The Skeptologists only exist because Ryan Johnson decided to contribute his time and video production expertise to skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need volunteers who do not have to have anything but an interest in skepticism.  There is a ton of online and local activism that anyone can do. The media and our politicians need skeptical feedback, and if you are reading this blog you can send an e-mail (although some argue that a handwritten letter or phone call has more impact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One TAM attendee came up to me this weekend to tell me that we inspired him to join his local school board. He lives in Alabama, and in his town there are evolution disclaimer stickers in the textbooks and corporal punishment of students is accepted. Because of the skeptical movement, he is now fighting in the trenches for science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about TAM and similar meetings is that they remind me of how much energy there is in grassroots skepticism. We may be an intellectual minority, but we are increasingly having an impact. And any individual can contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months ago Derek Bartholomaus decided he wanted to contribute to the skeptical movement. He found a niche – an issue that he cared about, and started the &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt; website. He brought no special skills to this project, just his passion. Three days ago he sat on a panel at TAM7  in front of a thousand people to discuss the anti-vaccine movement and received the loudest applause from the audience when introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, some throat clearing. It may seem odd for authors to respond so extensively to their critics. In the olden days, such exchanges happened very slowly, if at all, through letters to the editor, and usually they weren’t very long. But this is the Internet age, and there are very different circumstances here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The People Want It.&lt;/strong&gt; Hordes of commenters are demanding that we respond to PZ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PZ Asked For It. &lt;/strong&gt;Myers did not write a balanced review, an indifferent review, or even a negative review. Rather, he misrepresented our book, got its arguments wrong, assaulted its authors (”their hypocritical and ignorant paean to mealy-mouthedness”), and finally ended by concluding that our labor of over a year is “utterly useless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not be capable of objectivity judging our own work. But we’re also receiving many supportive emails from people who like the book, are seeing it spark constructive dialogue about solutions on places like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/07/scientist_pacs_and_judges.php"&gt;Chad Orzel’s blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/"&gt;RealClimate.org&lt;/a&gt;, and are witnessing the careful weighing of its arguments’ strengths and weaknesses at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2009/07/book_review_unscientific_ameri.php"&gt;places like Neurotopia&lt;/a&gt;. How could a book that is prompting thought and dialogue be “utterly useless”? Myers may disagree with our book in many respects, but debate itself is useful, is it not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Wrote a Contempt-Free Book.&lt;/strong&gt; Myers’ charges come from someone who is directly criticized in the book, and who admits that his opinion “is colored by the palpable contempt [its authors] hold for me.” But there’s no “contempt” here–just entirely fair criticism of Myers based on his freely chosen actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’ll get to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answering Myers, we will proceed in 10 points, spread across 3 posts to control their length. We will first summarize them here, and then elaborate in the next three posts until we’re done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Getting Personal? &lt;/strong&gt;Myers claims that our book contains “very direct and personal attacks on me and on Pharyngula, atheists in general, and anyone who fails to offer religion its proper modicum of respect.” We do not agree that we have launched &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; personal attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  &lt;strong&gt;Pluto. &lt;/strong&gt;Myers doesn’t appear to understand our argument here, as we will show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;What the Book Actually Says&lt;/strong&gt;. Starting with Chapter 1, Myers gives little if any sense of the book’s real contents and argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/strong&gt;. This is virtually the only thing Myers seems to agree with us on. But he doesn’t grasp the nature of Sagan’s uniqueness, or why Richard Dawkins is no Carl Sagan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  &lt;strong&gt;American Anti-Science&lt;/strong&gt;. Myers claims the book “entirely neglects the anti-scientific forces.” This is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.&lt;strong&gt; Root Causes&lt;/strong&gt;. Myers claims the book “demands we avoid addressing the structural roots” of the problem of science in society. That’s false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;strong&gt;Science in the Entertainment Industry. &lt;/strong&gt;By taking a single sentence about Richard Dawkins vastly out of context, Myers misrepresents our chapter on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Solutions. &lt;/strong&gt;Myers claims our book “offers no new solutions.” This is false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. &lt;strong&gt;Bigotry&lt;/strong&gt;. Myers flings this baseless, inflammatory charge at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;The Problem with PZ Myers. &lt;/strong&gt;Curiously, Myers doesn’t even address our criticisms of…him. But they’re serious and fair, and we will end by elaborating upon why, in the wake of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/the_great_desecration.php"&gt;communion wafer desecration&lt;/a&gt;, we decided we had to speak out about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how we’ll proceed, and we’ll begin with the first post in a few hours. The entirety of what we’ve written will carry over into tomorrow–but never fear, it is already drafted, and you will see it all soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we welcome comment here, we ask that you do not pre-judge our rebuttals on the points above until they have actually been posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first post is now up and can be found &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/13/pz-myers-vs-unscientific-america-part-i/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>the intersection</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247496280146"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1574">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/94aa80224ecd16c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">I again</title><published>2009-07-13T14:26:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T14:26:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1574" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/mp3clips/politicalspeeches/richardnixonconcession3242343432.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="7034880"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month, it was Barack Obama whose (allegedly) imperial ego was &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1495"&gt;said to be signaled&lt;/a&gt; by (fictitious) overuse of first-person singular pronouns. (Follow the link for discussion of columns on the topic by Terence Jeffrey, George F. Will, Stanley Fish, and Mary Kate Cary.) A few days ago, Peggy Noonan's devastating attack on Sarah Palin ("&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124716984620819351.html"&gt;A Farewell to Harms&lt;/a&gt;", WSJ, 7/11/2009) presented a similar argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;She wasn't thoughtful enough to know she wasn't thoughtful enough. Her presentation up to the end has been scattered, illogical, manipulative and self-referential to the point of self-reverence. "I'm not wired that way," "I'm not a quitter," "I'm standing up for our values." I'm, I'm, I'm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This characterization of Gov. Palin as excessively self-oriented is hardly new, as you can discover by searching the web for {&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=Palin+diva&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;Palin diva&lt;/a&gt;}. But is her rate of reference to self, at least as crudely quantified by the count of first-person pronouns, evidence of excessive ego-involvement, compared to politicians of the past?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say that the evidence is at best equivocal. Since last month's flurry of pronominal punditry left me with a handy little script for counting things, I compared &lt;a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/07/sarah_palin_resigns_july_3_200.html"&gt;Gov. Palin's July 3 resignation speech&lt;/a&gt; against three somewhat-similar speeches –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Nixon's 1962 concession in the California governor's context (the famous "You won't have Nixon to kick around any more") speech;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 1968 speech in which Lyndon Johnson announced that he wouldn't run again;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at two crude measures of ego-involvement: the rate of first-person-singular pronouns, where a higher rate suggests &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; ego-involvement; and the ratio of first-person-plural pronouns to first-person-singular pronouns, where a higher ratio suggests &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; ego-involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="text-align:center" border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st sing. forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Percent 1st sing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st plur. forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plur/Sing ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardNixonConcession.html"&gt;RN 1962 Concession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2480&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;152&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.1%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/680331.asp"&gt;LBJ 1968 Won't Run&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4129&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;83&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;114&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.37&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/character/links/nixon_speech.html"&gt;RN Resignation 1974&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1806&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;83&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.6%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2009/07/sarah_palin_resigns_july_3_200.html"&gt;Palin 2009 Won't Run&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;124&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;101&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.81&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By these measures, Palin is more ego-involved than LBJ, but less than Nixon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect prepared speeches to have a lower rate of first-singular pronouns than extemporaneous speeches — but Nixon&amp;#39;s 1974 resignation still weighs in at 4.6%. As discussed &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1495"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, George H.W. Bush's first press conference exhibited a rate of 5.5%, and George W. Bush's first two press conferences came in at 4.5%. So the rate of 4.0% in Sarah Palin's press conference is actually rather low, given that the topic was in fact her own status and plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a speech that's&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt; epically "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;scattered, illogical, manipulative and self-referential to the point of self-reverence", you should take a look at Richard Nixon's 1962 concession speech.&lt;/span&gt; I couldn't find a transcript on the net, so I bought the .pdf from the NYT's archive, and transcribed it into html form &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/RichardNixonConcession.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. An .mp3 of the audio — apparently minus a bit at the beginning — is &lt;a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/mp3clips/politicalspeeches/richardnixonconcession3242343432.mp3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. [Update: Ben Zimmer, whose Google Fu is strong, points out another html copy &lt;a href="http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/encyclopedia/article_show/Last_Press_Conference_1962_California_Gubernatorial_Campaign_/l0000408.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, apparently also derived from the NYT transcript.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that Nixon says in several ways that he&amp;#39;s not complaining about the press, while complaining about the press — these days, politicians generally omit the protestations and get right to the complaints.

I know there are many people who wanted to attend but could not, so for you I will point out that this year the JREF experimented with &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/jref-office"&gt;Ustreaming part of the conference&lt;/a&gt;. So you can get a dose of TAM skeptical goodness from the comfort of your computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I must say, for me the best part of these meetings is just being in a room with a thousand skeptics, some of whom are friends that I only get to see once or twice a year, including my fellow Skeptologists. There is also an energy to live meetings that, in my opinion, cannot be matched online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also struck me this year that many attendees approached me to ask what they can do to contribute to our efforts and the skeptical movement as a whole. They feel the energy of this growing movement and want to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepticblog.org/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" title="More..."&gt;Fortunately, Daniel Loxton, editor of Junior Skeptic, has already taken the time to answer this question. He wrote a book called “&lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/WhatDoIDoNext.pdf"&gt;What Do I Do Next?&lt;/a&gt;” which includes 101 ways to contribute to the skeptical movement. He interviewed many activist skeptics and included their answers in his list of what skeptics can do. They include many obvious answers – like organize a local skeptical meet-up group or help an existing one, start a blog or (if you are ambitious) a podcast, investigate some local paranormal claims and report on them, and you can send an e-mail of support to skeptologists@newrule.com saying you want this kind of skeptical content on the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some not-so-obvious answers – like organize a group tour of a science museum. Perhaps the most challenging answer Daniel gives is to explore new frontiers for skepticism. Find new ways that no one has thought of yet to spread appreciation for science and critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to consider what it is you enjoy doing and where your skills and talents lie. If you can do anything, chances are there is someone or some organization in the skeptical movement that can use your skills. We need computer programmers, graphic designers, artists, writers, experts in every scholarly field, journalists, teachers, marketing and PR experts, fundraisers, grant writers – any many more. This blog and The Skeptologists only exist because Ryan Johnson decided to contribute his time and video production expertise to skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need volunteers who do not have to have anything but an interest in skepticism.  There is a ton of online and local activism that anyone can do. The media and our politicians need skeptical feedback, and if you are reading this blog you can send an e-mail (although some argue that a handwritten letter or phone call has more impact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One TAM attendee came up to me this weekend to tell me that we inspired him to join his local school board. He lives in Alabama, and in his town there are evolution disclaimer stickers in the textbooks and corporal punishment of students is accepted. Because of the skeptical movement, he is now fighting in the trenches for science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing about TAM and similar meetings is that they remind me of how much energy there is in grassroots skepticism. We may be an intellectual minority, but we are increasingly having an impact. And any individual can contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months ago Derek Bartholomaus decided he wanted to contribute to the skeptical movement. He found a niche – an issue that he cared about, and started the &lt;a href="http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com/Jenny_McCarthy_Body_Count/Home.html"&gt;Jenny McCarthy Body Count&lt;/a&gt; website. He brought no special skills to this project, just his passion. Three days ago he sat on a panel at TAM7  in front of a thousand people to discuss the anti-vaccine movement and received the loudest applause from the audience when introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

They are colourful little fish that much larger fish will sit still for and allow the cleaner to dart all around them, even into the waiting jaws of their “clients,” while the cleaners feast of many small surface parasites. Cleaner fish provide one of the classic examples of mutualism in the animal kingdom, proving that evolution does not always mean bloody competition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:10px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;How do “client” fish recognize cleaner fish from a quick snack, particularly given that there are many different species of cleaners? Karen Cheney and colleagues tackle the problem not just from many different angles, but from many different lighting conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, they found &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; cleaner fish had either blue or yellow in their colouration, compared to only about 2/3 of a control group of fishes. They also confirmed a previous finding that all cleaner fish had a long stripe on the side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why blue and yellow? Is there any particular reason for these particular colours? It is just evolutionary happenstance, where one random colour became established, and later, all the others without it were selected against?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheney and colleagues hypothesized that these colours are used because they stand out strongly against the background. Demonstrating this is tricky, because what we see as a colour in a nice, brightly lit aquarium is not necessarily what another fish will see in the natural habitat, for several reasons. First, fish may not see colour like we do. Second, water filters out different wavelengths of light, so the colours change as you descend. Third, the major light source is overhead, whereas aquaria let in light from all sides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To test this, they did some computer modeling using the known visual properties of several fish species, and seeing how they responded to different colours in front of an average coral reef background. Blue, of almost any shade, came out as the most conspicuous for all species for fairly long distances. Yellow was particularly conspicuous against black – such as the long black stripes that cleaner fish have. It was also highly conspicuous against blue water, the other major visual element in a coral reef habitat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/SloDnwmhd7I/AAAAAAAACCE/LAfNedEX6os/s1600-h/cleaner_colour_experiment.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:80px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/SloDnwmhd7I/AAAAAAAACCE/LAfNedEX6os/s200/cleaner_colour_experiment.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;To top this all off, Cheney and company took some fish models, painted with different colours and patterns, into coral reefs. One was a realistic representation of a local cleaner fish, and the others had some variation of colour pattern. Just knocking out blue from the model significantly dropped the response of client fish (figure shown; click to enlarge). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blue &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;alone&lt;/span&gt; is not enough to attract clients, as several models with blue colours in the wrong places fared no better than the blue-less but otherwise realistic models. The ever more radical departures from the realistic colour scheme showed even more declines in client responses, but none of the “duds” were significantly different from each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors suggest that cleaner probably evolved before the conspicuous colouration, which is a sensible hypothesis. Just because something is conspicuous does not guarantee a client’s appropriate response. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where a highly visible colour preceded the evolution of the cleaning behaviour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This research does a very clean job of examining the signaling end of partnership between cleaner and client. Hopefully, someone will pick up with this on the receiver end, and start examining the sensory capabilities of the client fish that enable them to recognize cleaners and react appropriately to those signals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Current+Biology&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2Fj.cub.2009.06.028&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Blue+and+Yellow+Signal+Cleaning+Behavior+in+Coral+Reef+Fishes&amp;amp;rft.issn=09609822&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982209013037&amp;amp;rft.au=Cheney%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Grutter%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Blomberg%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Marshall%2C+N.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CBehavioral+Biology%2C+Zoology%2C+Ecology%2C+Evolutionary+Biology%2C+Marine+Biology"&gt;Cheney, K., Grutter, A., Blomberg, S., &amp;amp; Marshall, N.

Sci pays close attention to the role of scientists, Hollywood, and religion. She does a terrifically comprehensive review that discusses the paramount themes in our book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that there are a lot of people out there who simply&lt;br&gt;
don’t want to learn about science, it’s also true that communication is&lt;br&gt;
a two-way street. Scientists can’t sit back and expect their results to&lt;br&gt;
speak for them. While that does indeed work with other scientists, it&lt;br&gt;
doesn’t tend to fly with the lay public. And many scientists don’t WANT&lt;br&gt;
to communicate. Sci cannot tell you how many scientists go into lab&lt;br&gt;
work “so they don’t have to deal with PEOPLE”, or because they just&lt;br&gt;
HATE reading and writing. Teaching at the graduate level, even of&lt;br&gt;
future scientists, is often performed unwillingly and with as little&lt;br&gt;
effort as possible. Scientists know that their future, their career, is&lt;br&gt;
to be found in successes at the bench. I don’t think we can be blamed&lt;br&gt;
for wanting to pursue our careers, especially when “community outreach”&lt;br&gt;
counts for so very little in the pursuit of jobs or tenure. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/13/unscientific-america-untangled/#more-2417"&gt;(more…)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247490145190"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-412367875554238996">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c70b4da75d3cc693</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="chiropractors" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">General Chiropractic Council Hiring Staff to deal with Complaints</title><published>2009-07-13T11:16:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T11:16:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/07/general-chiropractic-council-hiring.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Le Canard Noir)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml</id><title type="html">the quackometer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247490094674"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_12_constructing_3.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/89bc019c2093dff5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Tutorials"/><title type="html">Clock Tutorial #12:  Constructing the Phase Response Curve</title><published>2009-07-13T11:42:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T11:42:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/VKzI2DH46LQ/clock_tutorial_12_constructing_3.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_tutorial_12_constructing_3.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/URL" title="Clock Tutorial #12:  Constructing the Phase Response Curve"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clock Tutorial #12:  Constructing the Phase Response Curve" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/upload/2006/06/ClockWeb%20logo2.JPG" width="104" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The fourth post in the series on entrainment, originally written on April 10, 2005, explains the step-by-step method of constructing a PRC.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://www.zenosblog.com/2009/06/omnibus-complaint-to-general.html"&gt;increase in complaints&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/05/reputation-of-british-chiropractic.html"&gt;due to the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Chiropractic_Association"&gt;British Chiropractic Association's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=555"&gt;attempt&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775"&gt;silence criticism&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/06/how-british-chiropractic-association.html"&gt;claims for chiropractic&lt;/a&gt; being an &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/06/18/british-chiropractic-association-bca-demonstrate-what-evidence-based-medicine-isnt/"&gt;evidence-free&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://layscience.net/node/548"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the BCA had been a bit less foolish, it could have avoided this whole debacle, but it appears that it was spoiling for a fight, and is &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/07/chiropractors-admit-chiropractic-has.html"&gt;looking pretty groggy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-1069614539075673462?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247483408389"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13719">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4a3e803de3f2764c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Sports"/><title type="html">Jesus at the Soccer Game</title><published>2009-07-13T11:00:21Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T11:00:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/13/jesus-at-the-soccer-game/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I thought it was overtly religious when college football quarterback &lt;strong&gt;Tim Tebow&lt;/strong&gt; wore black strips under his eyes with &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/01/08/tim-tebows-eyes-say-john-316/"&gt;religious phrasing&lt;/a&gt; during the BCS championship game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/tebow.jpg" alt="tebow" title="tebow" width="552" height="255"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, that’s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out what Brazilian soccer players &lt;strong&gt;Kaka&lt;/strong&gt; (below) and &lt;strong&gt;Lucio&lt;/strong&gt; did during the Confederations Cup last month:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Soccer.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Soccer.jpg" alt="Soccer" title="Soccer" width="468" height="443"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be asking: If a Brazilian people do it, can it be wrong?  (Ha!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Yes it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIFA, the soccer governing body, has reminded the players they are &lt;a href="http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-1199121/Brazils-football-superstars-told-Keep-faith-football.html"&gt;not allowed to make&lt;/a&gt; “displays of a personal, religious or political nature” while playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A warning letter was sent to the Brazilian football federation ‘to remind them of the relevant regulations, so that such incidents do not recur in the future’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian players, and Kaka in particular, are well-known for their strong religious beliefs and the squad and backroom staff formed a large circle and sank to their knees in prayer after the victory over the US at the end of last month.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A warning letter?  Like that’ll do any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will all continue until some player wears a shirt with an atheistic slogan (”I am a Soccer-ular Humanist”?)… You know this would all come to an end &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; if that happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Finally, after 2 years, we have an offer on the house!! We also did have to &lt;a title="a big hole" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3673085373/"&gt;re-dig our water well&lt;/a&gt;…and repair the septic tank…but it does seem like it will happen.  The downside to this is that the offer is contingent on our moving by July 30th.  EEEEK!&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bug_girl/3708312778/"&gt;&lt;img title="hair" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/3708312778_428115065d_m.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="161"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item 2:&lt;/strong&gt; I will be super busy the next two weeks with a major new program for first-year students, as well as getting our fall classes sorted out. So, posting will be very spotty.  I feel bad about phoning it in on the Bug Blog so often lately, but life is pretty crazy.  You can tell I’m stressed because I’ve cut most of my hair off.&lt;/p&gt;

Two psychologists from Columbia university reckoned that the physical stress of marathon running might result in cognitive impairments (&lt;a href="http://pbr.psychonomic-journals.org/content/16/3/475"&gt;Eich &amp;amp; Metcalfe, 2009&lt;/a&gt;). Although the benefits of moderate aerobic exercise are well-documented, levels of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;[a "stress hormone" produced by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenal_gland"&gt;adrenal glands&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; after strenuous marathon running are four times greater than those observed after laboratory-based stress induction paradigms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, cortisol levels recorded 30 min after completion of a marathon rival those reported in military training and interrogation (Taylor et al., 2007), rape victims being treated acutely (Resnick, Yehuda, Pitman, &amp;amp; Foy, 1995), severe burn injury patients (Norbury, Herndon, Branski, Chinkes, &amp;amp; Jeschke, 2008), and first-time parachute jumpers (Aloe et al., 1994). &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, along with parachute jumping, marathon running presents an ethical opportunity for studying the effects of extreme cortisol levels on cognitive processing. In particular, cortisol may disrupt &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;hippocampal&lt;/a&gt; function and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory"&gt;explicit memory&lt;/a&gt; -- the conscious recollection of previously learned information (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16891593"&gt;Brunner et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt;). In contrast, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454787"&gt;implicit memory&lt;/a&gt; is thought to be unconscious and independent of the hippocampus, as demonstrated in studies of amnesic patients where impairments in explicit memory are accompanied by intact implicit memory performance (&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15464402"&gt;Squire, 2004&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;sup style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(153,51,153)"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So would completing a marathon differentially affect explicit and implicit memory? The authors predicted the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our hypothesis was that when marathon runners had just undergone the stress of running a marathon as compared with several days earlier, their performance on the explicit cued recall task would be impaired. At the same time, we predicted that their performance on the implicit stem-completion task would be spared or might even be enhanced.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The participants were 261 individuals who had completed either the New York City Marathon or the Boston Marathon: 141 were tested within 30 min of finishing, while the other 120 were tested 1-3 days before the race. All participants were given an implicit memory test (word stem completion) and an explicit memory test (word stem cued recall). Both tasks involve studying a list of words, followed by a series of 3-letter word stems. The instructions dictated which form of memory was to be evaluated, as described in the Procedure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Participants rated 26 words for pleasantness on a 5-point scale. Text on the second page informed participants that each of the cues on the subsequent page would be the beginning of an English word. Their task would be to write a few letters to make each cue into any English word, but they were instructed to write down the first one that came to mind. The next page, which presented the implicit word-stem completion task, contained word stems from 13 words that were previously rated for pleasantness as well as stems from 13 unrated (baseline) words, randomly intermixed. Following completion of the implicit memory task, participants were given instructions for the explicit memory cued recall task. They were told that each of the cues on the subsequent page was the beginning of a word for which they had provided a pleasantness rating earlier. They were instructed to try to complete each cue with the word from the pleasantness-rating list—that is, to explicitly remember the previously rated words. They were also instructed not to look back at the list. After reading these instructions, they turned to the last page, which contained the 13 remaining three-letter word stems presented in a random order, all of which they had previously rated for pleasantness. Given the cues, they then attempted to recall the words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The brief example below gives a list of words seen during the study phase, followed by a series of word stems that are either completed with the first word that comes to mind (implicit memory), or used as cues to recall words from the study phase (explicit memory).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FRAGILE&lt;br&gt;BREAD&lt;br&gt;APPLE&lt;br&gt;BLANKET&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;APP_________&lt;br&gt;CHA_________&lt;br&gt;BLA_________&lt;br&gt;STI_________&lt;br&gt;STR_________&lt;br&gt;FRA_________&lt;br&gt;BRE_________&lt;br&gt;DEL_________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results below illustrate that a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_%28neuropsychology%29"&gt;dissociation&lt;/a&gt; between the two forms of memory was observed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_IA5nokOFh84/SlrYwNiIhdI/AAAAAAAADcE/jt5eKKWFAWg/s1600-h/Priming+and+Proportion+Recalled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="width:400px;height:226px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_IA5nokOFh84/SlrYwNiIhdI/AAAAAAAADcE/jt5eKKWFAWg/s400/Priming+and+Proportion+Recalled.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:arial"&gt;Figure 1 (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-family:arial;font-weight:bold" href="http://pbr.psychonomic-journals.org/content/16/3/475"&gt;Eich &amp;amp; Metcalfe, 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt; Performance on the implicit and explicit memory tasks. The left bars give the difference between the control (premarathon) and marathon (postmarathon) groups on the implicit memory word-stem completion task. The right bars give control group and marathon group performance on the explicit cued recall task. Priming is the difference in the proportions of correctly completed presented and unpresented (baseline) words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As predicted, there was a significant decline in explicit memory after running a marathon. Less expected (but still not a complete surprise) was an &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic"&gt;increase&lt;/span&gt; in performance on the implicit memory task. The authors&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;interpret the results as suggesting that complex neuromodulation associated with extreme stress enhances some brain systems and inhibits others... As we acknowledged in our introduction, marathon running results in a host of other physiological changes &lt;span style="font-size:85%"&gt;[beyond increased cortisol]&lt;/span&gt;, some of which may lead to decrements in explicit memory. However, consideration of those factors alone provides no obvious explanation as to why marathon running led to improved implicit memory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nevertheless, do they have a tentative conclusion about why that happened?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...Stress hormones, including norepinephrine, endorphins, and others, are surging in marathon runners. It is not unreasonable to suppose that these hormones serve to improve certain kinds of mental function.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;But don't even try to remember where you parked your car...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Footnote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(153,51,153)"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; But see &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18760659"&gt;Berry et al., 2008&lt;/a&gt; for the opposing view that explicit and implicit memory are &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; independent and dissociable forms of memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;References&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Berry CJ, Shanks DR, Henson RN.

It’s a piece focused on the entertainment industry and its role in perpetrating negative images of science–with a central focus on Michael Crichton, who also perpetrated outright misinformation about global warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article starts with the film &lt;em&gt;Angels &amp;amp; Demons&lt;/em&gt;, and the story of CERN, wrongly thought to be carrying out all manner of dangerous science–and then gets to the big thesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience of CERN is, more broadly, the experience of science in our culture today. It is simultaneously admired and yet viewed as dangerously powerful and slightly malevolent — an uneasiness that comes across repeatedly in Hollywood depictions. As science-fiction film director James Cameron (”Aliens,” “Terminator,” “Titanic”) has observed, the movies tend to depict scientists “as idiosyncratic nerds or actively the villains.” That’s not only unfair to scientists: It’s unhealthy for the place of science in our culture — no small matter at a time of climate crisis, bioweapon threats, pandemic diseases and untold future controversies that will surely erupt as science continues to dramatically change our world and our politics. To begin to counter this problem, though, we need to wake up to a new recognition: Fixing the problem of science education in our schools, although very important, is not the sole solution. We also have to do something about the cultural standing of science — heavily influenced by politics and mass media — and that’s a very different matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This Wednesday, the &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/"&gt;Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee&lt;/a&gt;---a federal committee that coordinates "all efforts" in the &lt;a href="http://hhs.gov/"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; (HHS) concerning autism---is meeting in Washington, D.C. The &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/events/2009/full-committee-mtg-agenda-july15.shtml"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; for this meeting: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- a joint meeting of the IACC and the &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/"&gt;National Vaccine Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt; (NVAC) Vaccine Safety Working Group to discuss vaccine safety and autism - presentations on the &lt;a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-HD-06-016.html"&gt;NIH Autism Centers of Excellence&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://ndar.nih.gov/"&gt;National Database for Autism Research&lt;/a&gt; (NDAR)&lt;br&gt;
- discussion of services-related activities &lt;br&gt;
- analysis of the autism research portfolio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evinced by the response to my &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_pun-intended_shot_on_division"&gt;most recent post on vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;, the first agenda item will most likely absorb a lot of attention and energy. The specific topic under discussion is to be "Feasibility and Design Issues Regarding Epidemiological Studies of Vaccinated, Unvaccinated and Alternatively Vaccinated Populations"---the sort of study that proponents of the notion that vaccines or something in vaccines might be "linked" to autism as a cause have long been calling for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's notable that the focus on this discussion item is "feasibility and design issues." There's been numerous calls by anti-vaccine/pro-vaccine safety advocates for such a study. Such advocates have asked, "What's so hard about doing such a study? Find a population of unvaccinated children, a population of vaccinated children, and compare the rates of autism---what's so hard about that?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a scientist and, as noted, my &lt;a href="http://web.mac.com/kjchew/iWeb/kc/kristinachew.com.html"&gt;educational background&lt;/a&gt; is in the humanities. So on the one hand, I very much see where the anti-vaccine/pro-vaccine safety advocates are coming from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, from what I've learned about designing and undertaking research studies, it's one thing to have an idea for a study, and another thing to execute it. What's under discussion is an epidemiological study that would involve studying the medical records of many, many children and a very large sample size of medical records at that. According to a &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2008/r080904.htm"&gt;2008 survey from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, most parents in the US have their children vaccinated, "with at least 90 percent coverage for all but one of the individual vaccines in the recommended series for young children." It's most likely that there'll be more children who have (1) been vaccinated and (2) have been diagnosed with autism, because there are more child who have been vaccinated than there are children who have not been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyways. I'm glad that the IACC and the NVAC are discussing such a study, if only to put some of these variables out for consideration. Whatever the design or results of such a study, should the findings be further proof that there is no link between vaccines and autism (because there is no link),  it's likely we'll see protests that something was done wrong, that the researchers had some kind of "bias," or some "&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-rebranding-of-autism/"&gt;moving of the goalposts&lt;/a&gt;" (as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/the_hannah_poling_case_and_the_rebrandin.php?"&gt;Orac at Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; puts it), and further calls for "studies" and disputes about "the science."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of vaccines and autism typifies the gap between scientists and public opinion noted in a &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/528/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released last week by the &lt;a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/528/"&gt;report on science and public opinion&lt;/a&gt; found that, while "American like science," only 17% of the public thinks that the U.S.'s  scientific achievements rate as the best in the world, in contrast to 49% of scientists thinking that they are. Further, scientists are critical about the public's knowledge of science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fully 85% see the public’s lack of scientific knowledge as a major problem for science, and nearly half (49%) fault the public for having unrealistic expectations about the speed of scientific achievements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are particularly displeased with the media's coverage of science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; About three-quarters (76%) say a major problem for science is that news reports fail to distinguish between findings that are well-founded and those that are not. And 48% say media oversimplification of scientific findings is a major problem. The scientists are particularly critical of television news coverage of science. Just 15% of scientists rate TV coverage as excellent or good, while 83% say it is only fair or poor. Newspaper coverage of science is rated somewhat better; still, barely a third (36%) of the scientists say it is excellent or good, while 63% rate it as only fair or poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/528/"&gt;Pew report&lt;/a&gt;, some 2,500 scientists were surveyed and about 2,000 members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that most people get their news about science from the media, rather than from reading the actual studies published in scientific journals or from speaking to scientists and hearing presentations by them, one might point the finger at the media for the gap between scientists and the public. The topic of vaccines and autism particularly highlights this divide, with the subject of vaccines and environmental causes of autism receiving a disproportionate amount of attention in the media, and with popular media outlets regularly producing news stories in which vaccines are said to be "possibly" linked to autism (because one can't outrule anything 100%). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it takes years and years to conceive of, plan, execute, write up, and publish a scientific study, it's not uncommon to find the media reporting about a study in progress or a presentation at a conference as if it were a "new discovery." The media are also constantly putting out stories in which parents report a child's "amazing progress" from this or that supplement, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_the_good_goods"&gt;device&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-skeptic13-2009jul13,0,3545952.story"&gt;portable HBOT chambers&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_need_for_autism_detox"&gt;detoxifying&lt;/a&gt; regimen, etc., etc.. These sorts of treatments receive further media attention when promoted by &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/why_people_believe_oprah"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation, and the Pew study, are further reminders about why we need to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/evaluate_science_not_celebrity"&gt;evaluate science not celebrity&lt;/a&gt;. But I also hope that the study sends a call out to scientists that they the reasons for the gap are not only the media's or the public's doing, or the public's simple "ignorance." Scientists must work on their communication too and keep in mind that the public, and parents in particular, need to know they are truly being listened to, and their fears, worries, and uncertainties addressed.  More than "more studies," this can assist in preventing miscommunication and distrust between the public and scientists---certainly there's been way too much of these around the topic of vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;

As the only other denizen of Science-Based Medicine who has experienced both worlds, that of a PhD and that of an MD, and as the one who two decades further along the path than Tim (give or take a couple of years), his musings reminded me of similar musings I’ve had over the years, as well as emphasizing yet again something I’ve said time and time again: Most physicians are not scientists. They are not trained like scientists; they are trained to apply scientific knowledge to the care of their patients. That’s what science-based medicine is, after all, applying science to the care of patients. Not dogma. Not tradition. Not knowledge of antiquity. Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave dogma, tradition, and “ancient knowledge” to practitioners of “alternative medicine.” That’s where they all belong. Whether you want to call it “alternative medicine,” “complementary and alternative medicine” (CAM), or “integrative” medicine (IM), it rarely changes and almost never abandons therapies that science finds to be no better than placebo, whereas scientific medicine is, as it should be, ever changing, ever improving. I’ll grant you that the process is often messy. There are often false starts and blind alleys, and physicians are all too often reluctant to change their practices in response to the latest scientific findings. We sometimes even joke that for some practices, it takes the supplanting of one generation of physicians with a new generation to get rid of some practices. But change does come when the science and evidence are there. Indeed, for example, in response to evidence that a bacterium, &lt;em&gt;H. pylori&lt;/em&gt;, causes duodenal ulcers, medical practice changed in a mere decade, which is about as fast as anyone could do the science and clinical trials to show the validity of the new concept. Although CAM practitioners like to hold up the example of Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, the researchers who discovered that H. pylori causes most duodenal ulcers, as an example of how researchers with radical ideas are ostracized, but that story is largely a myth, as our very own &lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/bacteria.html"&gt;Kim Atwood showed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of science to medicine is a difficult thing. It takes basic scientists and clinicians, but the two of them exist in different worlds. Or so it often seems. That’s why some individuals seek to straddle both worlds. Tim is one such person. So am I. Unfortunately, most people don’t understand what we do very well. We wear two hats. In my case, I’m a surgeon, and I’m a scientist. In Tim’s case, he’s a scientist and a physician, but he doesn’t yet know what kind of physician he will end up being. At the risk of sounding somewhat arrogant, I believe that we, and others like us, represent an important element in bridging the gap between basic science and clinical science, in, essentially, building a more science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By saying that people don’t understand very well what clinician-scientists doI don’t mean that people don’t understand what it is that a doctor or a surgeon does. Everyone knows that a doctor takes care of patients and that surgeons operate on patients, after all. I also don’t mean that they don’t understand what a basic scientist does, although most of them do seem to have some sort of an odd picture of us in a lab with test tubes and brightly colored solutions bubbling in the background, the same misconception that is common about pure basic scientists. In fact, I would go so far as to say that even most doctors and most basic scientists probably don’t understand the difficulties of combining a clinical career with laboratory research, because those of us who try to do both are in a distinct minority. The vast majority of doctors do only clinical practice, and basic scientists, not having gone to medical school, will never have the responsibility of caring for patients. Even among the minority of doctors who actually do research, the majority do mainly clinical research (testing new therapies in clinical trials, for example), and that is what most people think of when they think of doctors doing research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining a laboratory research career with a clinical career has always been difficult, but these days it’s become a Herculean challenge. One aspect of biomedical research not understood by most lay people is that basic scientists in academia doing research are usually expected to pay much (usually at least 50%) of their own salaries and all of their laboratory overhead through grant support, preferably from the NIH through the “gold standard” grant known as an R01. In smaller colleges, there are often faculty whose primary responsibility is to teach, but the big universities tend to require research and grant funding to support that research. If young faculty members don’t demonstrate the ability to compete for such grant support, they don’t get tenure. Usually, upon being hired fresh out of their postdoctoral fellwoship, they are given a startup package with enough support to keep their lab going for perhaps three or four years. After that, they are expected to be able to fund their own laboratories entirely through external funds. The bottom line is: If they can’t achieve that in the time allotted, they don’t get tenure, and often when they fail to get tenure they are shown the door. It’s a very Darwinian system. Yes, there are other requirements for tenure, such as peer-reviewed scientific publications of sufficient number and quality, science good enough to win the respect of peers, and evidence of teaching talent, but the bottom line is: If you can’t attract enough funding, the other stuff will hardly be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, consider the clinician-scientist. We have to compete for grant money with the same hungry basic scientists who can spend the vast majority of their time doing research. Worse, most of the reviewers in the study sections that decide which grant applications get funded are basic scientists. Yet, a large proportion of our time is taken up caring for patients. Those of us who have not undergone formal Ph.D. training may not have adequate experience in formulating a research plan in a logical and compelling narrative that can convince a study section that (1) we have a reasonable hypothesis; (2) we have evidence to support the hypothesis; and (3) we can formulate a scientifically credible plan to study that hypothesis. And we have to do this while devoting a significant part of our time to patient care. I am fortunate enough as a clinician-scientist in that I have a position where I can spend more time in the lab and office than I do taking care of patients, but my patient care responsibilities are still something that take up a lot of time. Consequently, some basic scientists look at doctors (especially surgeons) with condescension. (”Oh, isn’t that precious! He’s trying to do serious &lt;em&gt;research&lt;/em&gt;!”) Unfortunately, occasionally, that condescension is deserved–but it is not deserved nearly as often as some basic scientists seem to think it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time twenty or thirty years ago when clinician-scientists could be supported by “slush” funds derived from the clinical income of the department in which they worked. This was especially true of surgery departments, which were often revenue machines. Those days are long gone, dead and buried. Academic medical centers now have to live in the same world as private hospitals from a financial standpoint, and managed care companies are not willing to pay them more, even with the increased overhead and inefficiencies that come from training medical students and residents. True, Medicare does pay academic medical centers a per-head sum for such training, but that only covers direct costs. It doesn’t cover the hidden costs that come from the infrastructure that it takes to train residents and the inefficiencies that training residents involve. For instance, most surgeons could get a lot more operations done in a week if they didn’t have to carefully and slowly take residents through them. That would mean more revenue. But we academic surgeons have made a conscious decision that we believe that training the next generation of surgeons is of the utmost importance, and we derive many rewards from it. For example, there’s nothing like seeing a trainee achieve success. It reflects back on everyone who trained him or her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be that as it may, between decreased reimbursement and the increased expenses involved running an academic department, there is often little or nothing left over for research after paying the bills–if the department is lucky enough and well-managed enough not to be in the hole. In fact, academic physicians are generally expected to bring in enough clinical revenue to cover their own salary and expenses. Given that the actual collection rate for what is billed may be only $0.25 to $0.40 on the dollar (or even less), for a surgeon, covering one’s own salary, one’s secretary’s salary and overhead, office overhead (yes, the University charges office rent), and other expenses can require billing for as much as $500,000 to $1 million a year–or even more. Busy clinicians can pull this off. Part-time clinicians don’t have a prayer, particularly if they have the added overhead of a laboratory. That means, to support clinician-scientists, an academic department must explicitly make the commitment to support research in a bit of an almost “communistic” endoavor. Busy clinicians in the department must buy into the vision and be willing to subsidize the development of new physician-scientists with some of the fruits of their own clinical productivity, accepting, in essence, less income than they could make otherwise in return for the benefits of belonging to an academic department and practicing at an academic medical center. That is, in essence, the compact. The other part of the compact is that physician-scientists usually end up accepting considerably less salary than they could make in private practice (or even if they were a busy academic clinician) in order to have enough protected time to do their research. This is not an inconsiderable hurdle for a new clinician-scientist to face in these days of medical students finishing with a quarter of a million dollars of student loan debt, which is why MD/PhD programs funded by the NIH are so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about grant support? That can help, but a scientist can only ask for salary support for the percentage of his time that is devoted to the research project for which grant support is being requested. Consequently, if you are 50% clinical, there is no way you can ever support your entire salary, as basic scientists can, with grants. The most you can ever hope to support is 50%. Rare clinician-scientists can support maybe 70% of their salary if they are (1) only 30% clinical and (2) good enough at getting funded to fund the 70% effort they are putting towards research. It’s worse than that, though. Most clinicians make an academic base salary, plus a salary that comes from clinical revenue generated by the department. Grant support can only ever be applied to the academic base salary. Consequently, clinicians can rarely cover more than 20-40% of their &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; salary with grant support. Again, even with an NIH grant, almost no clinician-scientist can cover his own overhead through clinical activity and grant support, even very successful ones. It would take several hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in government grant support, which includes around 50% or so added to the grant for institutional overhead, to have a shot at doing it. The benefits physician-scientists bring to the department are usually not financial; rather they include intellectual benefits and the prestige that an active and successful research program brings. Again, not all departments can afford such benefits in this climate of diminishing reimbursement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, as clinician-scientists, we do have one advantage over basic scientists in one area. We understand the clinical management of the disease we’re studying in an up-close and personal way that the basic scientist can never match because they don’t take care of patients. We deal with patients with the disease and watch the course of the disease every day. We know the deficiencies in present therapies and issues needing more research attention in a way that basic scientists have a very hard time matching. We make observations about the disease that basic scientists have an even harder time making. Indeed, the flip side of the condescension basic scientists all too often heap upon clinicians trying to do basic and translational research is the similar condescension far too many clinicians heap upon the way basic scientists tend to focus on molecular and cellular mechanisms rather than practical results. We want new therapies &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; because patients are suffering and dying &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;, and are often impatient with the leisurely pace (or leisurely it seems to us) at which pure science basic scientists move. This is not an insignificant factor, given the reorientation of the NIH in recent years towards research that is likely to lead to treatments sooner rather than later. Nonetheless, overall, the forces arrayed against the success of clinician-scientists are formidable indeed, and bridging the differences between the cultures of basic scientists and pure clinicians is not the least of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most formidable challenge for a clinician-scientist is finding enough “protected time” (time with little or no patient care responsibility that is “protected” for research). One of the most challenging tasks a young clinician-scientist has is to protect his research time from the inevitable intrusions of patient care. If he doesn’t, then one day he will wake up to realize that he hasn’t been in his laboratory for anything other than brief visits for over a month; that his entire schedule has been taken over by patient care demands; and that his lab is about to run out of money because he never had time to oversee the production of enough preliminary data to write a competitive grant application. Having adequate protected time is impossible unless a young faculty member’s chairman understands the need for protected time and is willing to help protect that research time. Sometimes that means laying down the law that new patients beyond a certain number will have to be seen by other surgeons. Without the chairman’s support, even the best effort to protect research time will likely fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen it with colleagues and friends over the years. Driven by the unfortunate financial reality of academic surgery today, their chairmen or division chiefs, while paying lip service to the need to provide protected time for research, would demand more and more clinical revenue, which means seeing more and more patients. For a while, the clinician-scientists would try to make up for steady infiltration of their research time by patient care responsibiliteis by working more and more late nights and weekends, but eventually something had to give, and almost inevitably it would. In these cases, what almost always “gives” is the research. The clinician-scientist concludes that he is forced to give up research and–usually–become primarily a clinician. Sometimes the rare surgeon-scientist with an exceptional devotion to and talent for research will become a pure basic scientist, but they can only do that if they are so successful at publishing and applying for grants that their labs are, in essence, awash in grant money. I’ve been extraordinarily fortunate so far in that all my bosses and the institution have done their best to help me protect my research time, but I have no illusions that, were I ever to lose all my grants and show no promise of obtaining more, my current institution (or any institution) would cut me slack for very long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, I think that surgeons trying to do research have it worst of all. In the medical specialties, it is often possible to arrange schedules so that doctors doing research only have concentrated clinical duties one or two months out of the year, with the rest of the year serving as protected time. In medicine, pediatrics, and other specialties, this is known as being “on service” and usually involves being the attending who is responsible for an inpatient service for the month. Once the month’s up, the inpatient clinical responsibilies end, leaving only however much outpatient clinical responsibility was agreed to. For busy clinicians, this can be a lot of outpatient responsibility, but for clinician-scientists, it is often designed to be only one day of clinic a week or even less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In surgery, such huge chunks of protected time are rarely possible for several reasons (outside of V.A. or county hospitals, and even there such huge chunks of protected time are rapidly disappearing). First, surgery is personal. Patients don’t want just any surgeon operating on them. They usually want a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; surgeon that they’ve come to trust. Consequently, the clinical burden is ongoing throughout the year, leading to us trying to protect days at a time, rather than weeks or months at a time. Second, even if we could arrange our schedules the way medical doctors do, our specialties are skill- and task-oriented. We would risk the atrophy of our operative skills if we were only to operate intensively one or two months a year. (Indeed, clinical surgeons sometimes look down on surgeon-scientists as not having the same level of surgical skills they do.) Finally, surgeons have a very special relation to their patients. If a patient I operate on has a postoperative complication, &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; going to take care of it, unless for some reason I’m on vacation or out of town (and for some surgeons, even those are not always barriers to taking care of their own). It doesn’t matter if I’m on call or not, if it’s the middle of the night or not, or if it’s during the weekend or not. That’s just the nature of surgery as a specialty. Although my surgical specialty has relatively few emergencies, for other surgical specialties (for instance, GI surgery), just this aspect of surgery alone can make a productive research career extremely problematic. The bottom line is that we are expected to be just as good as surgeons who are pure clinicians while devoting only part of our time to surgery &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; just as good at laboratory research as basic scientists–again, while dedicating only part of our time to it, usually a lot less than basic scientists can. We rarely succeed at both to an equal degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that basic scientists will retort that they have other responsibilities, too. They teach, sometimes a lot. They sit on committees. They have bureacratic responsibilities that take them away from their research every bit as much as surgery. Well, not quite. If a basic scientist fails to fulfill his teaching or administrative duties or doesn’t fulfill them well, no one is likely to die or to suffer a complication or additional pain. Patient care often can’t be put off, at least not for long. Unlike teaching, it can’t always be predicted or scheduled. That’s the difference. It’s possible to succeed as basic science faculty while being not so good at other responsibilities, like teaching. My own experience with several professors during graduate school bears this observation out. There were a few professors who were highly successful in their research, with many publications, international reputations, and oodles of grant money. Unfortunately, some of them were awful in the classroom. There were even more faculty who were just OK in the classroom, but–again–ran successful laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that what I said may sound arrogant to some or as though I am denigrating the difficulties basic science faculty face. I assure you that it is not and I am not. Not having much experience in teaching classes, I would probably have an absolutely hellacious time at first learning to become a competent classroom teacher (as opposed to a clinical teacher, which is different) if I ever tried to be straight basic science faculty. However, it’s just the nature of the beast. You can’t afford to be bad or even mediocre as a physician, regardless of whether or not you are a scientist as well. You just can’t. If you are bad or mediocre, you have no business treating patients. You have to be &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; competent as a physician or surgeon, and preferably you should be excellent. It’s also more difficult in a highly technical specialty, like surgery. Practice makes a difference in highly technical skills, unless you happen to be one of those lucky surgeons who is just naturally gifted, and, even then, practice is what turns the technically gifted surgeon into a superstar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining one’s medical and surgical skills as a part-time physician is perhaps the most difficult challenge facing the surgeon-scientist or the clinician-scientist. The only way many of us manage it is to focus their clinical practice like a laser very tightly on one specialized area that interests us and about which we’re passionate, which is what I have done. That’s the practicality of it. The necessity for competence when you don’t get as much experience and practice as a straight clinical surgeon almost always mandates focus. Even then, it remains really difficult. As a part-time surgeon, I don’t do nearly as many cases as a full-time surgeon does, and, as long as I continue to run a lab, I never will. That is another reason by my practice has to be tightly focused if I want to do right by my patients and still have the opportunity to do research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cuts both ways, too, although that’s usually less of a consideration compared to the basic science faculty with significant teaching responsibilities. I’m in essence a part-time scientist as well. I can’t devote the same amount of time to writing grants, papers, supervising the lab, or even doing experiments that most basic science faculty can and do. There just isn’t time. But perhaps the biggest issue that cuts both ways is the literature. In essence, physician-scientists have twice as much scientific/medical literature to deal try to keep up with. We have to keep up with the medical literature involving our specialties &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the scientific literature involving our research, and we have less time to do it, to boot. No wonder I never feel as though I’m on top of the surgical literature. No wonder every so often I get blindsided by a paper related to my research that I never noticed, probably more so than basic scinetists do. That’s why another essential practical necessity for success is to have good people working for you and good collaborators working with you. Although this is true for any researcher, for clinician-scientists it’s doubly true: One bad hire can destroy your lab’s productivity and even ultimately your lab. You need people who can work with little supervision, and you need collaborators who can help you out with the more arcane basic science that you aren’t trained in. In return, you offer your collaborators your clinical understanding of the disease process and, if you happen to be a surgeon, one of the most precious resources of all for biomedical research: access to human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, perhaps the key difference between being a basic scientist and a clinician-scientist is predictability. The basic scientist, even the one who has significant teaching responsibilities that take up a big chunk of his schedule, has a much more predictable schedule. Patient care can be made somewhat predictable, but emergencies will always occur, the number and frequency of which depend upon the specific specialty. There will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be calls on weekends or in the middle of the night. Disease doesn’t respect weekends or nights. Moreover, the natural tendency is for patient care responsibilities to grow slowly and inexorably. In essence, a surgeon can be a victim of his own clinical success, and his success in the clinical realm can negatively impact success in the scientific realm. I know one surgeon who has become so popular that every time he tries to cut back his practice in order to engage in more academic purusits, there is a backlash from his referring physicians, who start calling him to ask him if he can make an exception “just this one time” for this patient or that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is always yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a few real-life scenarios that illustrate the conflict between doing bench research and taking care of patients. Scenario number one: You are in the middle of a big experiment when the E.R. calls about a patient you recently operated on, who has returned intrabdominal sepsis. It turns out that your anastomosis has broken down, and the patient needs urgent surgery to fix the problem. However, if you take off to do the surgery, your experiment will be ruined, wasting days of work and hundreds of dollars worth of reagents. The choice is really no choice at all; you must take care of the patient and trash your experiment. You could ask one of your partners to deal with the complication, but they have patients of their own to deal with. They’re all either in clinic or in the operating room, anyway. Besides, it’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; patient’s complication. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; need to deal with it, because that’s how surgeons roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario number two: You have a grant due in a few days. You thought you had planned well, having canceled your clinic for that week several months prior and told the schedulers not to schedule any operations that week, in order to allow maximal time to finish the grant. However, there is a patient that your boss tells you that you must see and take care of &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. Alternatively, one of your top referring physicians is asking you to see this patient as soon as possible. One more variation: The patient is a V.I.P. that the CEO of your hospital is asking you to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario number three (perhaps the most common scenario): Your clinical load has been slowly growing. Almost without your realizing it, you now find yourself spending less and less time in the laboratory doing experiments until you are no longer doing benchwork at all. This alone would not necessarily be a problem. After all, many senior basic science faculty find themselves no longer doing actual benchwork. (Indeed, in a lab I worked at a long time ago, we’d go out of our way to dissuade our PI from venturing into the lab.) However, over time, your patient load continues to increase and you now find yourself spending less and less time even meeting with your lab personnel. You find that you are no longer even sure of what is going on in your lab on a day-to-day basis anymore. There are a pile of manuscripts that need to be finished, but you can’t get to them because you’re always in the clinic or in the O.R.. You try to work on them at home, but your wife and children demand their fair share of your attention when you manage to make it home for a while. You’ll soon be due to try to renew your grant, something you have no idea if you’ll be able to do now. You could try to cut back on your clinic time, but that would mean that patients’ waiting time to be seen would increase. Patients with cancer would be forced to wait longer. Also, if you cut back your clinical productivity, your department would not like it, because you would no longer be supporting your salary and overhead with clinical revenue, and this doesn’t even take into account the consideration that your referring physicians will not be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples, but in the end the conflicts all come down to the tension between two worlds which are very different, the world of the scientist and the world of the clinician. The world of the scientist values inquisitiveness and intellectually stimulation. It also tends to be less interested in practicality and more interested in intellectual pursuits and scientific novelty; i.e., answering questions that have never been asked or answered before. In constrast, the world of the clinician is almost purely practical. It tends to be task- and action-oriented, and protocol-driven. Asking and answering questions are valued, but only insofar as the questions and answers pertain to diagnosing and treating disease or overcoming problems that get in the way of good patient care. The clinician-scientist tries to bridge the gap between these two world in an increasingly difficult environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I didn’t scare Tim off; so I’ll try to finish on a note of hope. Why do I continue to do it? I’ve often joked that, as an MD and a PhD, I catch equal crap from both worlds. Clinicians wonder if I know what I’m doing in the operating room, and basic scientists don’t think I can hack it as a basic scientist. So why put up with the stress of wearing two hats? Why not pick one or the other? There are two reasons. First, I think that clinician-scientists bring a unique perspective to the study of human disease that neither a clinician or a scientist alone can. Second, as I suspect must be the case with Tim, I want to make a difference. Nothing would be as satisfying as making a clinical observation, taking it to the laboratory, developing a treatment based on my laboratory observations, and then testing that in patients and seeing it work. True, I may never manage shepherd a treatment through all those stages (clinical observation, laboratory observations on the basic science, development of a therapy based on the science, and testing in clinical trials). After all, it can take a decade or more to do so, and I probably don’t have more than maybe two decades left in my career, but wouldn’t it be great if, before it’s time for me to retire, I manage to pull it off?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hyper-realistic Einstein robot at the University of California, San Diego has learned to smile and make facial expressions through a process of self-guided learning. The UC San Diego researchers used machine learning to “empower” their robot to learn to make realistic facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, no other research group has used machine learning to teach a robot to make realistic facial expressions,” said Tingfan Wu, the computer science Ph.D. student from the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering who presented this advance on June 6 at the IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University, have demonstrated for the first time rhesus monkeys and humans share a specific perceptual mechanism, configural perception, for discriminating among the numerous faces they encounter daily. The study, reported in the June 25 online issue of Current Biology, provides insight into the evolution of the critical human social skill of facial recognition, which enables us to form relationships and interact appropriately with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Humans and other social primates need to recognize other individuals and to discriminate kin from non-kin, friend from foe and allies from antagonists,” said lead researcher Robert R. Hampton of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center and Emory’s Department of Psychology. “Our research indicates the ability to perform this skill probably evolved some 30 million or more years ago in an ancestor humans share with rhesus monkeys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those keeping track, that’s 29,994,000 years before the existence of the whole universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/an_annoyed_query.php"&gt;But then Mooney gone and dug himself even deeper&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview with the Daily Kos, one commenter responding to Mooney’s claims that critics have misrepresented his position, quoted from Myers’ review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this, he proceeds to damn the “New Atheists” for “collapsing the distinction” between methodological and philosophical naturalism, and argues that Dawkins is taking a philosophical position and misusing science to claim it “entirely precludes God’s existence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the commenter asked Mooney:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My question is, did you in fact say that Dawkins uses science to ‘entirely preclude God’s existence?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you did, that is an extreme mischaracterization and strikes me as an easy way for you to just kick around Dawkins to make inroads with the masses.  That is pragmatism rather than reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what Dawkins actually wrote in his book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To which Mooney responded by saying. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we use that phrase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
although it is not attributed to dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve read dawkins book in some detail, and our objection is to his making god’s existence a scientific question. i realize he does not ascribe full certainty to his atheistic conclusion–but he claims he can reason scientifically about god’s existence. we’re saying that a lot of theologians, philosophers, etc, would say that’s a category error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i really have to ask that you read our book, rather than its misrepresentation in skewed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So did PZ Myers “misrepresent” Mooney and Kirshenbaum’s position on this point? Myers quotes the whole paragraph from their book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much like the anti-evolutionists do, the New Atheists often seek to collapse the distinction between methodological and philosophical naturalism. In &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, Richard Dawkins makes the dubious claim that the existence of God is, as he puts it, “unequivocally a scientific question.” Quite a lot of philosophers — and scientists — would disagree. It is one thing to say that scientific norms and practices preclude ascribing any explanatory force to God in, say, the movement of atoms, or the function of DNA. It’s quite another to say they entirely preclude God’s existence. In rejecting God or any other supernatural entity, Dawkins is taking a &lt;em&gt;philosophical&lt;/em&gt; position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to reread the quote from Myers’ review above. He described their position almost verbatim from how they describe their position in their book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the other thing that really gets me is the way Mooney ends that response with “i really have to ask that you read our book, rather than its misrepresentation in skewed reviews.” He makes that same statement again and again in&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/12/live-on-daily-kos-at-9am/"&gt; the comments section of his own blog&lt;/a&gt; linking to the Daily Kos interview as a substitute for actually addressing legitimate arguments people make about his position, the same position he’s been aspousing for some time already. He insists that the only opinions about his position that are worth addressing are from those people who happen to have read his entire book (which went on sale only this week). And of the few who have received advanced copies, have read the entire book, and given a detailed negative review to his position, he simply writes off as being biased and dogmatic. And of course the Mooney Zombies on his site back him up repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s my snarky response to that absurd demand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now remember everyone. No one has the right to judge anyone’s position until they’ve read their book. That means no one has the right to judge Hitler’s position until they’ve read his book (and if they never read it, they can’t have an opinion on Hitler’s position). I don’t care if Hitler had expressed his position elsewhere. You have to judge his position solely based on what he wrote in his book and that’s that. And also, one more thing. You’re not allowed to read Hitler’s book with any preconceived notions or prejudices of any kind. If you do, you’re just a dogmatic fool…which only means that no one is allowed to criticize you anymore because that’s the Meaney thing to do and not the Mooney thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently in British Columbia, Canada, participating in the Batholiths Onland experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nominally, this large group effort involving over 50 scientists and grad students is for “a seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection survey across the Coast Mountains batholith of British Columbia, Canada.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rather terse description does not really do justice to the project, which has the purpose of discovering why continental mountain ranges are often made of granite instead of basalt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevance to the Panda’s Thumb? (1) Real science involves real work; when is the last time you saw a creationist actually measure something, or use a shovel? (2) Real scientists think the earth is billions of years old. You just can’t scientifically reconcile these batholiths with a 10,000-year old earth without being more than a little schizophrenic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phase of Batholiths is for performing seismic imaging of the crust and mantle below the Canadian Rocky mountains in British Columbia, one of the largest collection of batholiths (from the Greek &lt;strong&gt;bathos&lt;/strong&gt;, depth + &lt;strong&gt;lithos&lt;/strong&gt;, rock, a &lt;em&gt;large mass of intrusive igneous rock believed to have solidified deep within the earth&lt;/em&gt;) in the world. My part of this experiment is as one of six IRIS/PASSCAL scientists assisting with the seismic ranging for the project. This involves deploying thousands of seismic sensors and recorders across British Columbia, and recording responses to several man-made detonations. These responses can then be analyzed to yield, first, seismic velocity profiles; these are then related these to variables such as density or temperature, which in turn are related to chemical composition of the crust and mantle. Many other sources of data are also used, including gravitometric measurements, geochronology, broadband recordings of natural earthquake tremors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my discussions with John Hole, one of the project’s Principal Investigators (PI’s) from Virginia Tech (but a native Canadian, and glad to be working there again), I learned that that basic goal of the project is to locate the “missing pyroxenes.” In brief, as the mantle is distilled chemically below the crust, the result is primarily gabbro, a mafic rock quite similar to basalt in chemical composition. Further distillation of gabbro can remove the pyroxene components, leaving what is basically granite which we see in these huge, beautiful batholiths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, where do the pyroxenes go? Are they hiding between the crust and the mantle? Are they melted back into the mantle? Why are mountain ranges not always formed from huge basaltic lava flows? Why is there so much granite in continents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will be ongoing for several weeks in July 2009. For a photographic tour showing what it’s like to work on a “Big Science” project, log in the &lt;a href="http://nmskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/blogging-batholiths.html" rel="external "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batholiths entry to the NMSkeptic blog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Comments may be left here (MT4 willing) or there, but no where in between.  &lt;/p&gt;

Believe it or not, I was even on a panel! While I'm gone, However, my flight was scheduled to arrive very late Sunday night, and I'm still recovering. Consequently, for one more day I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I really shouldn't do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really shouldn't go perusing the blog of the house organ of the Discovery Institute's propaganda arm, &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org"&gt;Evolution News &amp;amp; Views&lt;/a&gt;, as I did yesterday. I'm not as young as I used to be, have a family history of cardiovascular disease, and am not in the greatest of shape. Reading idiocy such as what regularly appears there surely cannot be good for my blood pressure or my general health, nor can it be good for my mind. Still, for you I nonetheless delve deeply into the muck of logical fallacies, half-truths, distortions, and misinformation that spews forth from the Discovery Institute, keeping my eye out for when it intersects with an area of interest to me, the intersection between medicine and evolution. (It's the same reason that, even now, I still occasionally visit Bill Dembski's home for wandering sycophants, &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/"&gt;Uncommon Descent&lt;/a&gt;, to see what DaveScot and the rest of the "intelligent design" anti-evolutionists are up to.) This time around, I came across an &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/07/did_darwinism_hinder_colon_can.html"&gt;article at EN&amp;amp;V&lt;/a&gt; that was so breathtakingly idiotic that at first I assumed that it could only have come from everybody's favorite creationists neurosurgeon, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=egnor&amp;amp;sa.x=6&amp;amp;sa.y=5&amp;amp;sa=search"&gt;Dr. Michael Egnor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/the_energizer_bunny_of_antievolution_1.php"&gt;Energizer Bunny of anti-evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, my first instinct was wrong. It was Casey Luskin, flak extraordinaire for the Discovery Institute, &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2007/07/did_darwinism_hinder_colon_can.html"&gt;crowing about how he thinks&lt;/a&gt; that "junk DNA" somehow disproves evolution. He finished his little exercise in scientific mendacity with a howler so amazing that I literally could not believe that I was reading something so stupid, even from him.

In spite of the hopeful research announcements that appeared a few days ago, I wouldn't recommend getting one's hopes up just yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a topic I've discussed before: &lt;a href="http://scienceandreason.blogspot.com/2008/04/calorie-restriction-tor-signaling-and.html"&gt;Calorie restriction, TOR signaling, and aging&lt;/a&gt;. And for related stuff on mTOR: &lt;a href="http://scienceandreason.blogspot.com/search/label/mTOR"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The executive summary is that inhibition of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mtor"&gt;mTOR&lt;/a&gt; signaling has been shown to extend lifespan in yeast, roundworms, and fruit flies. Mice can now be added to this list, in experiments that included rapamycin in their diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's the press release: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090708132800.htm"&gt;Easter Island Compound Extends Lifespan Of Old Mice: 28 To 38 Percent Longer Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (7/8/09)&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On July 8, in the journal Nature, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and two collaborating centers reported that the Easter Island compound – called "rapamycin" after the island's Polynesian name, Rapa Nui – extended the expected lifespan of middle-aged mice by 28 percent to 38 percent. In human terms, this would be greater than the predicted increase in extra years of life if cancer and heart disease were both cured and prevented.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although rapamycin and some related compounds have been investigated as anti-cancer therapies, the hypothesized lifespan-extending benefits are thought to be related to the by now well-documented benefits of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie_restriction"&gt;calorie restricted&lt;/a&gt; diets. (For very recent news on that front, see &lt;a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/45430/title/Caloric_restriction_extends_life_in_monkeys%20%EF%BF%BD_study_finds"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for example.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Aging researchers currently acknowledge only two life-extending interventions in mammals: calorie restriction and genetic manipulation. Rapamycin appears to partially shut down the same molecular pathway as restricting food intake or reducing growth factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does so through a cellular protein called mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which controls many processes in cell metabolism and responses to stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A decade ago, Dr. [Dave] Sharp proposed to his colleagues that mTOR might be involved in calorie restriction. "It seemed like an off-the-wall idea at that time," Dr. Richardson said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experiments were performed in parallel at three separate research centers and consisted of feeding hundreds of mice, starting at an age of 20 months, a diet containing a special formulation of rapamycin designed to evade breakdown in the digestive system. It was found that the age at which 90% of mice had died rose from 1,078 days to 1,179 days in male mice, compared to controls, and from 1,094 days to 1,245 days in females. The total lifespan extension, on average, was therefore 9.4% in males and 13.8% in females. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that some accounts of the research claim lifespan extensions of 28% to 38%, but this is misleading, since those figures represent the extension of the "old age" period of mouse life beginning at 20 months. They do not mean that the mice lived up to almost 40% longer in total. (Some pretty shoddy reporting going on here....) And there was no particular evidence to indicate that extensions of such size would have occurred if the special diet began at an earlier age. However, in experiments still going on, there is evidence for some extension when addition of rapamycin to the diet begins for mice 270 days old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, even an extension of human lifespan in the 10% range – 7 or 8 years – would be quite an accomplishment, provided quality of life in the final years remained about where it is today. (Which is a big if.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are various reasons to suspect that even a 10% extension in humans is rather optimistic. Some reasons:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant, currently used therapeutically to prevent organ transplant rejection. The experimental mice were maintained under conditions that carefully protected them from infection – conditions that would not be realistic for humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although mice and humans are both mammals, their genetics are not all that similar. The complete sequence of the mouse genome was recently announced (see &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news162622136.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and it turns out that about 20% of mouse genes are different from human analogs, or not found in humans at all. (It's been 90 million years since the last common ancestor of mice and humans.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapamycin is known to inhibit an important protein &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinase"&gt;kinase&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mtor"&gt;mTOR&lt;/a&gt; (mammalian target of rapamycin). mTOR plays a key role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival, so it's not all that surprising that rapamycin might affect cell biology relevant to aging and longevity. This same property of rapamycin makes it interesting as an anti-cancer agent. Rapamycin and similar compounds that inhibit mTOR have in fact been found to have anti-cancer properties in animal models. Several analogs of rapamycin have been investigated as anti-cancer therapies, and one has even been approved for human use (&lt;a href="http://www.wyeth.com/hcp/torisel/home"&gt;Torisel&lt;/a&gt;). But even in the anti-cancer setting, mTOR inhibitors haven't yet been slam-dunk successes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is not clear that rapamycin in these experiments was working the same way as calorie restriction. None of the rapamycin-fed mice lost body weight, and calorie restriction usually works best when started relatively early in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experimental mice that received rapamycin got a dose of 2.24 mg per kg of body weight. That&amp;#39;s quite a lot – about 30 to 60 times (per kg) what would be given to a 60 kg human for immunosuppression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unfortunate truth is that cell signaling pathways that affect cell growth, proliferation, and survival are rather complicated, and any interventions in such pathways are very likely to not have the expected effects and/or to have various unexpected side-effects. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MTOR-pathway-v1.7.svg"&gt;Here's a diagram&lt;/a&gt; of just some of the important pathways mTOR is involved in. Imagine that were an electrical circuit and you made ad hoc changes to important components of the circuit.... Perhaps you can see how trying to affect mTOR in order either to control cancer or enhance longevity might be a dicey proposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In spite of all the reservations, there are still promising signs for the role of mTOR inhibition in lifespan extension. The mechanism of action need not be the same as calorie restriction, even though that hasn't been ruled out either. For example, TOR is known from yeast and nematode studies to promote protein production in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome"&gt;ribosomes&lt;/a&gt; and to inhibit protein degradation via &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy_(cellular)"&gt;autophagy&lt;/a&gt;. Invertebrate studies have shown that reversal of these TOR effects can increase lifespan. And TOR signaling is also known to influence cell growth, cell-cycle progression, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondria"&gt;mitochondrial&lt;/a&gt; metabolism, and insulin-analog signaling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember what we said about the diversity of effects of mTOR signaling? That&amp;#39;s definitely a sword that can cut both ways – it&amp;#39;s powerful, but hard to predict and control. We need to understand a lot more of the biological details – otherwise we&amp;#39;re just swinging the sword in the dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="100"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Nature&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1038%2Fnature08221&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Rapamycin+fed+late+in+life+extends+lifespan+in+genetically+heterogeneous+mice&amp;amp;rft.issn=0028-0836&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=&amp;amp;rft.issue=&amp;amp;rft.spage=0&amp;amp;rft.epage=0&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fdoifinder%2F10.1038%2Fnature08221&amp;amp;rft.au=Harrison%2C+D.&amp;amp;rft.au=Strong%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Sharp%2C+Z.&amp;amp;rft.au=Nelson%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Astle%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Flurkey%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Nadon%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Wilkinson%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Frenkel%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Carter%2C+C.&amp;amp;rft.au=Pahor%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Javors%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Fernandez%2C+E.&amp;amp;rft.au=Miller%2C+R.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Biology%2CHealth%2CMolecular+Biology%2C+Biogerontology"&gt;Harrison, D., Strong, R., Sharp, Z., Nelson, J., Astle, C., Flurkey, K., Nadon, N., Wilkinson, J., Frenkel, K., Carter, C., Pahor, M., Javors, M., Fernandez, E., &amp;amp; Miller, R.

It is entitled &lt;em&gt;Evolution and Ethics: Human Morality in Biological &amp;amp; Religious Perspective&lt;/em&gt;. It is really a collection of essays by a number of authors compressed into a book edited by Philip Clayton and Jeffrey Schloss. The primary reason I read this book in the first place was because it looked interesting. I found a few bits and pieces in it at least a little noteworthy the first time around, so I’m going to be posting some occasional blurbs about various parts as I am writing diligent notes as if this book were for a class. Here’s some of what I have so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.2&lt;/strong&gt; “we seem to be dealing with two profoundly different metanarratives in evolutionary naturalism and Christian theism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously; without such a profound difference, the need for dozens of texts outlining the distinctions would be pointless.  I won’t start off reading this book and being too snippy. I think Schloss knew this reaction would result from the nonbelievers among us as he goes on to say later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.3&lt;/strong&gt; “Our goal is to begin tentatively, not out of noncommittal diplomacy, but out of exploratory humility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would certainly hope that that claims lacking sufficient evidence are properly treated as such, but I seem to recall this not being the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.4&lt;/strong&gt; Introduction to determinism and evolutionary ethics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.5&lt;/strong&gt; Evolutionary reductionism and descriptive levels of causality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.8&lt;/strong&gt; “The non-adaptationist approach does not address the why question, because it does not view human morality as a biological adaptation at all but rather as a ’spandrel’ (Gould and Lewontin 1979) or by-product of interaction between other cognitive capacities that are adaptive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptive approach: “Unlike organisms with a relatively small repertoire of rigidly determined behaviors, the extensive range of behaviors, the extensive range of behaviors open to human beings requires a parsing mechanism to help us choose among behavioral options that are too varied to computationally assess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.9&lt;/strong&gt; Morality as a social necessity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.11&lt;/strong&gt; “Cynical implications notwithstanding, indirect reciprocity does make sense of, and successfully predicts, many aspects of human moral systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.12&lt;/strong&gt; “So is the very best strategy for cooperative inclusion to be a genuinely good person? Groucho Marx quipped, “Honesty and fair-dealing is the way to succeed–if you can fake that, you’ve got it made.” (self-deception theory)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.17&lt;/strong&gt; “Thus David Oates concludes, ‘For followers of Darwin, the traditional ‘problem of evil’ was turned on its head: evil could henceforth be assumed; the problem became, the problem of goodness’ (Oates 1988).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.19&lt;/strong&gt; “First, notions of kin selection and reciprocal altruism constitute the most systematic explanation to date of the central tendency of moral affections.&lt;br&gt;
“Second, notions of indirect reciprocity and self-deception constitute an unusually rich resource for understanding–and expoosing–religious inauthenticity and the conditions that promote it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, it’s not too terrible, that was the introduction by Schloss. The next essay was by Michael Ruse, who, as I recall, is a bit incoherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.28&lt;/strong&gt; Erasmus Darwin and the “Great Chain of Being”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m rather curious why the “progress” in evolution thing keeps popping up; it’s fairly well discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.40&lt;/strong&gt; The distinctions of humans from other animals; Ruse cites Charles Darwin as having claims speech and ethics are two distinctly human features and Ruse then quotes himself extensively to prove this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Refer to Shermer &lt;em&gt;The Science of Good and Evil&lt;/em&gt; dealing with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to not post any more from Ruse; it’s like reading &lt;a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/"&gt;meaningless postmodern drivel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He likes the pink Dannon Le Cremes, which seem to be raspberry or strawberry. As long as they’re pink there’s no difference to Alex and none to me, either, because I hate yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate the look of it, the feel of it, the smell of it, and presumably I’d hate the taste of it. Slick, cold, smelling vaguely of something spoiled. Which it isn’t, of course, at least as far as nutrition is concerned, and I hate myself for hating it, because I know it’s fabulous for you and about the most good-for-you bang for the buck you’re going to find in your local dairy case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:225px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/yogurt.jpg" alt="Image: Walmart" width="215" height="215"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image: Walmart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can’t stand it. So for a long time too I’ve assisted Alex in eating it. “Alex!” I’d call. “Yogurt!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s been eating yogurt since we had him in a highchair on feeding therapies, fresh home at age 1 from the hospital. At that time, anything good was gold if it slid past slim Alex’s lips. (”Yogurt!?” wondered my big brother, a creature of the diet-conscious advertising of the 197os. “If you want him to gain weight, why do you have him eat yogurt?” Fine, bro. You try to feed him…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, school and teachers got him back onto yogurt — only Le Creme, in the same way he’ll only eat Hebrew National hot dogs, unchallenged winners of taste test after taste test — and soon they were claiming he was eating it on his own. No smears on the table, no icky pink spots on pants’ legs, no wiping up that gives dad the willies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we’ve tried it at home. “Alex! Yogurt!” Sometimes he comes to the table with his hands over his mouth, but that’s a crack. Sit him down and scoop in the first spoonful and he opens like a steamed clam. “Alex, you eat it yourself now.” Take that step toward independence and, like so many such steps, spare your father something in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later and the container is almost scraped bare. I scrape together the last spoonful, and another quarter of a $2.99 bargain in Alex’s eating is ready for the rinse and the recyling bin. No muss and no fuss. Now we just need to get him to put them away from the grocery bags.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers' finding is that the two are mutually reinforcing - a culture's implicit belief that females are not associated with science can actually harm girls' and womens' science performance, they argue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To recap, if something about being female really does predispose a person to be weaker at science, then across the world, girls should under-perform, on average, relative to boys. However, whilst this is true in some countries, other countries actually show the opposite pattern, with girls outperforming boys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by such observations, Nosek's team wondered whether cultural beliefs about gender and science might negatively affect girls' science performance. They used a version of the &lt;a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/"&gt;implicit association test&lt;/a&gt;, hosted on a website, to record implicit beliefs about gender and science among more than half a million people from 34 countries.  By allocating categories (e.g. "male-related words" and "science-related words") to either the same or different response keys, the test shows how easily people associate those categories in their mind. Around the world, 70 per cent of participants exhibited an implicit stereotype - associating science with males more than females.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers then looked at international science test scores recorded in 1999 and 2003 for children aged about 12 years. They found a correlation with the implicit stereotype scores, so that in those countries where more people held stereotyped beliefs about gender and science, girls tended to under-perform at science relative to boys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken in the context of previous research showing that awareness of gender stereotypes can harm people's performance (e.g. girls perform worse at maths after being reminded of the stereotype that females are inferior at maths), the researchers said their correlational findings support the idea that a culture's implicit beliefs about science stereotypes can affect girls' science performance in a mutually reinforcing fashion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"National policy initiatives addressing both factors simultaneously stand the best chance to maximise national scientific achievement," they said. "Education campaigns attempting to bolster women's participation and performance must overcome the pervasive implicit stereotypes that are already embodied in individual minds."&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/25_rb2_large_white.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1073%2Fpnas.0809921106&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=National+differences+in+gender-science+stereotypes+predict+national+sex+differences+in+science+and+math+achievement&amp;amp;rft.issn=0027-8424&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=106&amp;amp;rft.issue=26&amp;amp;rft.spage=10593&amp;amp;rft.epage=10597&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnas.org%2Fcgi%2Fdoi%2F10.1073%2Fpnas.0809921106&amp;amp;rft.au=Nosek%2C+B.&amp;amp;rft.au=Smyth%2C+F.&amp;amp;rft.au=Sriram%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Lindner%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Devos%2C+T.&amp;amp;rft.au=Ayala%2C+A.&amp;amp;rft.au=Bar-Anan%2C+Y.&amp;amp;rft.au=Bergh%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Cai%2C+H.&amp;amp;rft.au=Gonsalkorale%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Kesebir%2C+S.&amp;amp;rft.au=Maliszewski%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Neto%2C+F.&amp;amp;rft.au=Olli%2C+E.&amp;amp;rft.au=Park%2C+J.&amp;amp;rft.au=Schnabel%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Shiomura%2C+K.&amp;amp;rft.au=Tulbure%2C+B.&amp;amp;rft.au=Wiers%2C+R.&amp;amp;rft.au=Somogyi%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Akrami%2C+N.&amp;amp;rft.au=Ekehammar%2C+B.&amp;amp;rft.au=Vianello%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Banaji%2C+M.&amp;amp;rft.au=Greenwald%2C+A.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Psychology"&gt;Nosek, B., Smyth, F., Sriram, N., Lindner, N., Devos, T., Ayala, A., Bar-Anan, Y., Bergh, R., Cai, H., Gonsalkorale, K., Kesebir, S., Maliszewski, N., Neto, F., Olli, E., Park, J., Schnabel, K., Shiomura, K., Tulbure, B., Wiers, R., Somogyi, M., Akrami, N., Ekehammar, B., Vianello, M., Banaji, M., &amp;amp; Greenwald, A.

I just received my copy on Friday and haven't finished it yet.  You know, grants, data, blah blah blah...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of my Sciblings have and that began this week's hooplah.  PZ is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php"&gt;unamused&lt;/a&gt; and ERV has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/07/congrats_on_the_transformation.php"&gt;basically called&lt;/a&gt; Chris and Sheril traitors.  ERV's comments section is a whole 'nother discussion to be had.  All I'll say for now is that there is some mention there over whether Abbie or I are the bigger "drama queen" here at &lt;a href="http://www.scienceblogs.com/"&gt;ScienceBlogs&lt;/a&gt;.  I think the entire question is rooted in a fallacy.  I can&amp;#39;t be a drama &amp;quot;queen.&amp;quot;  I am the domestic and laboratory &lt;i&gt;goddess&lt;/i&gt; already.  Thus, by default, the win is hers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/why_jesus_makes_me_a_bad_scien/drama%20queen.jpg" alt="drama queen.jpg" height="250" width="250"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.buycostumes.com/mgen/merchandiser/19461.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: You feel free to wear that crown proudly, sister&lt;/b&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, my interest in the discussion is minimal at best.  I have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/02/on_the_blending_of_god_and_sci.php"&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt; about being a Catholic scientist and my relationship with church and science.  But even though I agree vehemently about the need to separate education and science from religion, the comments  typically come back to how to scientifically test the existence of God in a way that will satisfy those who do not currently believe in a higher power.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I knew dudes, don't you think I'd have done it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/why_jesus_makes_me_a_bad_scien/silly-kid-sticking-out-tongue.jpg" alt="silly-kid-sticking-out-tongue.jpg" height="400" width="267"&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_gGE_XbvzgYQ/SKHpBptKbJI/AAAAAAAAATQ/4zZjrUHhNGg/s400/silly-kid-sticking-out-tongue.jpg"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;: "There is a God." "No there isn't." "Yes there is." "No there isn't."&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It's largely the broad-brush painting of anyone who has faith in a higher power as a "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/wackaloon%20theocratic%20neofuedal%20douchescrote"&gt;wackaloon theocratic neofuedal douchescrote&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; though that largely makes me avoid these discussions to begin with.   I get that there are some real nutters out there -- creationists and global warming deniers -- but that&amp;#39;s a hard place to come back from short of retaliating with &amp;quot;godless goatfucking cockknuckle.&amp;quot;  And even then, what&amp;#39;s the point?  I don&amp;#39;t really think my atheist brethren are godless goatfucking cockknuckles.  I usually agree with them when it comes to issues of science education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to textbook biology , I don&amp;#39;t usually find myself substantially disagreeing with them about the &amp;quot;how.&amp;quot;  Usually just the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;, and I am very content to keep the &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; out of public education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's with all of this in mind that I realize that there is no real way to reply to the unsubstantiated rant to come out of &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/2009/07/10/more-on-science-and-religion/"&gt;PhysioProf a couple of days ago&lt;/a&gt;.  He writes (I&amp;#39;ll quote the whole post.  It&amp;#39;s certainly shorter than an abstract):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/why_jesus_makes_me_a_bad_scien.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/why_jesus_makes_me_a_bad_scien.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/N-XeYXdGxnU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247444880198"><id gr:original-id="http://draust.wordpress.com/?p=632">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08ab07dfadd76301</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Of conferences, 5 yr olds and Professors</title><published>2009-07-12T21:17:32Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T21:17:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://draust.wordpress.com/2009/07/12/of-conferences-5-yr-olds-and-professors/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">No bad science this time – Dr Aust muses on scientific conferencing, family life, and the usefulness of child psychology

That was a fun weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, despite my best efforts, completely failed to leave the pawns up a tree near Thetford&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3713453237/" title="IMG_0302 by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2601/3713453237_bd3c88f1ed.jpg" height="500" alt="IMG_0302" width="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so we trundled onwards to Norwich, where they’d laid on a parade and fireworks for us. Which was rather kind, I thought. The Lord Mayor came out and waved to us too, so rather a fun evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3714266418/" title="IMG_0305 by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3422/3714266418_f1e83521db.jpg" height="375" alt="IMG_0305" width="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning we got back into the hire car and braved the wilds of deepest Norfolk, rocking up at Chez Gee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3713463267/" title="IMG_0324 by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2478/3713463267_53520803d8.jpg" height="500" alt="IMG_0324" width="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lovely time was had by all, as were chips and fish and pies, and I found a complete fossil record of Henry Moore’s early works. We also discovered Microsoft’s attempt at an iPhone, and here’s Henry using it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pommiebastards/3714275736/" title="iStone by Pommiebastards, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2480/3714275736_b6c32fa736.jpg" height="500" alt="iStone" width="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The ultimate in silicon technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy million years in development (the iStone, not Henry): proof, if it was needed, against intelligent design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did want to write a serious blog post on intermediate fossil forms and the dangers of science, in that it can often show you want you want to see, but (a) Henry has the photos and (b) he’d probably make a better job of it than I, being a palaentologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came home to the blessed safety of the south of the River, checking each other’s hands for the right numbers of fingers and feet for webbing. I’m pleased to report that we remained non-&lt;span&gt;NFN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and for those of you who remember the arm-wrestling competition last year, in which Henry cheated by using &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; arms to my one, you might be interested to learn that despite hours of practicing against his daughters, he was only able to win our table-top football match by 10 goals to nine, and refused a re-match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

There's been a stream of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/communication_is_more_important_than_speech"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/behavior_communication_it_just_makes_sense"&gt;communication&lt;/a&gt; (and an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/take_action_for_accessible_communications"&gt;action for accessible communications&lt;/a&gt;---please sign if you have not yet!). Communication is one of my favorite topics, whether considering an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/aac_again_beyond_words"&gt;augmentative device&lt;/a&gt; for Charlie or just &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/breaking_the_habit"&gt;trying to understand&lt;/a&gt; what he's telling us, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_talk_and_a_lot_of_pictures"&gt;with words and without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie communicates plenty, but one thing that's he's not yet able to do is to explain what happened to him. Most of the time, he's either with us or at school, and getting a detailed-enough, honest report about his day has been a long-term effort. We've tried forms with boxes to check off, communication books, and the current system---email. Charlie's teacher (he has the same teacher for Extended School Year as he did during the regular school year) writes to me every day; on the days that she is not in the classroom, she usually gives us a report about what went on the day before. There's usually a comment about "behavior"---something or other usually happens (though I'm happy to report that nothing major did the first week of ESY). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like these emails to be more about what Charlie does or learns, but the reality is that the "behavior business" needs to be documented and anything major written up in an incident report, which we are supposed to receive a copy of. The many things that Charlie is learning and accomplishing often get snowed under. But then I remember some of the notes I used to receive from Charlie's teachers, which were generally positive but really didn't give me any idea of what was going on in the classroom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charlie had a great day!!!!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's such a good boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie did well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a nice weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teachers are pressed for time and I doubt any parent expects a literary production! Especially when a child is young and still learning to talk and communicate or if a child is (like Charlie) not very verbal, teacher's notes often feel like my lifeline to Charlie's day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only four students in Charlie's class and as many aides, so his teacher has the time to focus on each child sufficiently. And of course, having a good, open, trusting relationship with one's child's teacher is essential, but that is a topic for a whole other post (and one I'm going to refrain from saying more about at the moment, as we have a district-requested IEP meeting this Tuesday morning.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not only Charlie who has trouble getting his message across---helping him to do so has made me more than aware of my own miscommunications.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247436015052"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13679">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ccb760280e8eeb2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">A Review of Your Religion is False by Joel Grus</title><published>2009-07-12T21:00:03Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T21:00:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/12/a-review-of-your-religion-is-false-by-joel-grus/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/02/11/all-your-religions-are-false/"&gt;posted a video&lt;/a&gt; of a talk by &lt;strong&gt;Joel Grus&lt;/strong&gt;.  That talk has now turned into a book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982481802?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0982481802"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/YRIF.jpg" alt="YRIF" title="YRIF" width="325" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter what you believe, Grus thinks &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982481802?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0982481802"&gt;your religion is false&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To all those people who think the New Atheists focus too narrowly on Christianity, Grus counters that argument and blows it out of the water.  He’s not making over-your-head philosophical arguments… he’s just pointing out the problems with each and every faith he can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What religions are deemed false?  All the major ones, of course, and then some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoroastrianism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shinto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kabbalah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clapton-worship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wicca&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pastafarianism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?  Why is that last one included in the list?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grus explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Part of me suspects that Pastafarianism is not a serious religion but was designed primarily to mock some of the more prominent religions.  On the other hand, this suspicion is rooted primarily in the ridiculousness of the notion of a Flying Spaghetti Monster.  Using this sort of ridiculousness as a criterion I could just as easily mount the same suspicion against any of the other religions in this book.  As I have first-hand experience that those other ridiculous religions are practiced in earnest, I am forced to assume that the same is true of Pastafarianism, and I am forced to point out that Pastafarianism is (like every other kind of food-worship) false.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you write a book like this, with 91 short chapters, without pointing out the same things over and over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to that is why I like the book so much.  Grus not only explains why each religion is false, he explains each religion’s basic beliefs.  That’s actually a far better use of this book for me, as a sort of religious encyclopedia.  It’s nothing you can’t find on Wikipedia, but it’s less objective and far more entertaining.  I doubt Grus’ arguments against faith will change many minds, but it will educate you on the finer points of religions you don’t tend to hear much about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the chapter on Jainism (the religion in which I grew up) especially carefully and it was surprisingly accurate (and with some depth!).  I don’t see that very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also not a direct assault on any one particular faith, which makes the book more palatable for anyone who is religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for Muslims.  They might not want to read the hilarious chapter on Islam, which ends the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nonetheless, there is no excuse for terrorism; the veil liberates no one; pork is exceptionally tasty; rent-to-own is a huge rip-off; praying five times a day is a huge waste of time; and there is no god Allah.  Islam is false.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm now in that state of summer leisure mixed with the responsibility of providing entertainment for the kids that causes a man to forget what day it is of the week. And so a week's fun is no longer restricted to its last two days. But I have done nothing grandiose lately: mainly pottered about and enjoyed being reunited with my lady wife after her recent visit to the in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Friday and Saturday were largely taken up by housework of the interior decoration kind. My dad likes to suggest grandiose changes to our house and incite my wife into supporting his ideas, but as he also invariably offers to perform the work in question I can't complain. I felt that one short wall of our large living room needed re-painting and the construction of a large wall-hung book case. While I was busy with this wall, my dad and my wife painted all the other three walls and the ceiling. Now we have 24 glorious metres of shelves and nicer-coloured walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to bookshelves, I am a passive plaything of women. My first bookshelf I found next to the laundry room when I was in student housing -- thanks, Lady Fortune. My second one I bought to match my first wife's shelves. No 3 I bought to match No 2. And now I have just gotten shelves as per a design by my dad's wife, who used to head the Swedish interior decorators' association. What is my own true wish in bookshelves? I shall most likely never know. But it felt good to start getting our books out of the cardboard boxes and onto the new shelves last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving my dad to apply the last coat of paint this morning, we headed out to my mom's place in the archipelago. (Near Djurhamn, the harbour site where I've done fieldwork.) Sunshine, wind, rounded grey cliffs, pine trees. I live beside the main Medieval shipping lane from the Continent to Stockholm. This is beside the Early Modern route.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A long-serving Church of England bishop has predicted that the Church of England will cease to exist within a generation. In an article in the Sunday Telegraph, the Right Reverend Paul Richardson said declining church attendance and the rise in multiculturalism meant that "Christian Britain is dead".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Church is rapidly declining, with attendances at its services in freefall, a proposal on the table at the next General Synod meeting to cut the number of bishops, and huge holes in its finances due to the economic downturn and a lack of congregants to donate to the collection plate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Richardson said that the Church had lost more than one in ten of its regular worshippers between 1996 and 2006, with a fall from more than one million to 880,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only concern would be that some other, more malevolent church could rise to take its place. Maybe the next step would be for the state to declare that the official state religion was atheism, just to preclude any nastier replacement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/cheerful_news_from_the_uk.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/5agYutiaYMs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247432477687"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/what_not_to_do_in_the_neighbor.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9660f2ee82b0a81a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">What not to do in the neighborhood of Temple Square</title><published>2009-07-12T21:12:21Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T21:12:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/jLNdYXQzIdw/what_not_to_do_in_the_neighbor.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/what_not_to_do_in_the_neighbor.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;How often have you seen this? An affectionate couple are walking along holding hands, and one gives the other a kiss on the cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way you might have missed seeing that fairly often is if you are legally blind. It&amp;#39;s common, it&amp;#39;s harmless, and it&amp;#39;s rather sweet — and we normally approve of such mild public expressions of affection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, the &lt;a href="http://www.sltrib.com/ci_12811907?source=most_viewed"&gt;couple consists of two young men&lt;/a&gt;, and especially if it is in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gay couple says they were detained by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints security guards after one man kissed another on the cheek Thursday on Main Street Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"They targeted us," said Matt Aune, 28. "We weren't doing anything inappropriate or illegal, or anything most people would consider inappropriate for any other couple."
Aune and his partner, Derek Jones, 25, were cited by Salt Lake City police for trespassing on the plaza, located at 50 East North Temple, according to Sgt. Robin Snyder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know exactly where that is — it&amp;#39;s near the huge office building that is headquarters for the Mormon Empire. Good work, Matt and Derek! If there is any place on the planet that most needs some demonstration of gay endearment, that&amp;#39;s one of the best (oddly enough, all the others that I can think of are also centers of established religion…). Maybe a few hundred loving couples of all sexes ought to descend on the place and show the Mormon security guards that they can&amp;#39;t quell people&amp;#39;s feelings for one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aune did show a little naivete, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kiss happened on a former public easement given up by city in 2003 in a controversial land-swap deal. The easement became private property, allowing the church to ban protesting, smoking, sunbathing and other "offensive, indecent, obscene, lewd or disorderly speech, dress or conduct," church officials said at the time. In exchange, the city got church property for a west-side community center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Aune said he was one of those who protested the transfer at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"They claimed in 2003 this would never happen, they were never going to arrest anyone," he said. "It's clear now they do have an agenda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's clear &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;? Trust me, when a church lobbies for the right to police offensive behavior in any place, they&amp;#39;ve got some very specific stuff in mind, and the people who don&amp;#39;t fit into their narrow fundamentalist pigeonhole should know it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you do — they&amp;#39;re going to get you. You probably don&amp;#39;t even want to bend over to tie your shoelaces when some straitlaced repressed Mormon authority figure with a nightstick is standing somewhere behind you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/what_not_to_do_in_the_neighbor.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/jLNdYXQzIdw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247432477686"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/looking_for_some_godless_hymns.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4398c39a3698c3a7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Looking for some godless hymns?</title><published>2009-07-12T21:03:36Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T21:03:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/pX1pkTWKYhE/looking_for_some_godless_hymns.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/looking_for_some_godless_hymns.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eric Jayne has put together a list of his &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/content/view/360/1/"&gt;top 30 atheist songs&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I am quite humbled by the interest that has been generated by our paper “Has the climate recently shifted?” (&lt;a href="http://www.uwm.edu/~kswanson/publications/2008GL037022_all.pdf"&gt;Swanson and Tsonis, 2009&lt;/a&gt;), and would like the thank the RealClimate editors for the opportunity to give my perspective on this piece.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before delving into the paper itself, a few words about the place of our work in the global warming “debate” are in order.  A quote from the early 20th century Viennese polymath Egon Friedell (which I ran across in the wonderful book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/books/review/Schillinger.t.html"&gt;Cultural Amnesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Clive James) captures the situation better than any words I could ever weave; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt; Electricity and magnetism are those forces of nature by which people who know nothing about electricity and magnetism can explain everything. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substitute the words “modes of natural climate variability” for “electricity and magnetism,” and well…,  hopefully the point is made.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It first needs to be emphasized that natural variability and radiatively forced warming are not competing in some no-holds barred scientific smack down as explanations for the behavior of the global mean temperature over the past century.  Both certainly played a role in the evolution of the temperature trajectory over the 20th century, and significant issues remain to be resolved about their relative importance.  However, the salient point, one that is oftentimes not clear in arguments about variability in the climate system, is that all else being equal, &lt;em&gt; climate variability and climate sensitivity are flip sides of the same coin&lt;/em&gt;.  (see also the post &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/12/natural-variability-and-climate-sensitivity/"&gt;Natural Variability and Climate Sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A climate that is highly sensitive to radiative forcing (i.e., responds very strongly to increasing greenhouse gas forcing) by definition will be unable to quickly dissipate global mean temperature anomalies arising from either purely natural dynamical processes or stochastic radiative forcing, and hence will have significant internal variability.  The opposite also holds. It’s painfully easy to paint oneself logically into a corner by arguing that either (i) vigorous natural variability caused 20th century climate change, but the climate is insensitive to radiative forcing by greenhouse gases; or (ii) the climate is very sensitive to greenhouse gases, but we still are able to attribute details of inter-decadal wiggles in the global mean temperature to a specific forcing cause.  Of course, both could be wrong if the climate is not behaving as a linear forced (stochastic + GHG) system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, our paper is fundamentally about inter-decadal variability in the climate system and its role in the evolution of the 20th century climate trajectory, as well as in near-future climate change.  The climate system has well known modes of variability, such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), that are active on inter-annual time scales.  We are interested in how this short time-scale (from the climate perspective!) variability impacts climate anomalies over multi-decadal time periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we find is that when interannual modes of variability in the climate system have what I’ll refer to as an “episode,”  shifts in the multi-decadal global mean temperature trend appear to occur. I’ll leave the details of these episodes to interested readers (&lt;a href="http://www.uwm.edu/~kswanson/publications/2008GL037022_all.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2007/2007GL030288.shtml"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), as things get pretty technical.  It’s sufficient to note that we have an objective criteria for what defines an episode; we aren’t just eyeballing curves.  The climate system appears to have had three distinct “episodes” during the 20th century (during the 1910’s, 1940’s, and 1970’s), and all three marked shifts in the trend of the global mean temperature, along with changes in the qualitative character of ENSO variability.  We have also found similar types of shifts in a number of model simulations (both forced and unforced) that were run in support of the IPCC AR4 report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contentious part of our paper is that the climate system appears to have had another “episode” around the turn of the 21st century, coinciding with the much discussed “halt” in global warming.  Whether or not such a halt has really occurred is of course controversial (it appears quite marked in the HadCRUT3 data, less so in GISTEMP); only time will tell if it’s real.  Regardless, it’s important to note that &lt;b&gt; we are not talking about global cooling, just a  pause in warming. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.uwm.edu/~kswanson/rc_fig1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" border="0" style="float:right;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s our perspective on how the climate will behave in the near future?  The HadCRUT3 global mean temperature to the right shows the post-1980 warming, along with the “plateau” in global mean temperature post-1998.  Also shown is a linear trend using temperatures over the period 1979-1997 (no cherry picking here; pick any trend that doesn’t include the period 1998-2008).  We hypothesize that the established pre-1998 trend is the  true forced warming signal, and that the climate system effectively overshot this signal in response to the 1997/98 El Niño.  This overshoot is in the process of radiatively dissipating, and the climate will return to its earlier defined, greenhouse gas-forced warming signal.  If this hypothesis is correct,  the era of consistent record-breaking global mean temperatures will not resume until roughly 2020.   Of course, this contrasts sharply with other forecasts of the climate system; the purple line roughly indicates the model-based forecast of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5839/796"&gt;Smith et al. (2007) &lt;/a&gt;, suggesting with a warming of roughly 0.3 deg C over the 2005-2015 period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.uwm.edu/~kswanson/rc_fig2.jpg" width="350" height="300" alt="" border="0" style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would anyone in their right mind believe what I’ve just outlined?  Everything hinges on the idea that something extraordinary happened to the climate system in response to the 1997/98 super-El Niño event (an idea that has its roots in the wavelet analysis by &lt;a href="http://ams.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;issn=1087-3562&amp;amp;volume=4&amp;amp;issue=1&amp;amp;page=0001"&gt;Park and Mann (2000)&lt;/a&gt;).  The figure to the left shows the spatial mean temperature over all grid boxes in the HadCRUT3 data set that have continuous monthly coverage over the 1901-2008 period.  While this provides a skewed view of the global mean, as it is heavily weighted toward North America, Europe and coastal areas, unlike the global mean temperature it has the cardinal virtue of being a consistent record with respect to time.  The sole exclusion in the figure is the line connecting the 1997 and 1998 temperatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, anomalous behavior is always in the eye of the beholder.  However, the jump in temperature between 1997 and 1998 in this record certainly appears to pass the “smell test” (better than 3 standard deviations of interannual variability) for something out of the ordinary.  Nor is this behavior dependent on the underlying time interval chosen, as the same basic picture emerges for any starting time up until the 1980’s, &lt;em&gt; provided you look at locations that have  continuous coverage over your interval&lt;/em&gt;.  Again, as the temperature anomaly associated with this jump dissipates, we hypothesize that the climate system will return to its signal as defined by its pre-1998 behavior in roughly 2020 and resume warming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do our results have to do with Global Warming, i.e., the century-scale response to greenhouse gas emissions?  &lt;b&gt;VERY LITTLE&lt;/b&gt;, contrary to claims that others have made on our behalf. Nature (with hopefully some constructive input from humans) will decide the global warming question based upon climate sensitivity, net radiative forcing, and oceanic storage of heat, not on the type of multi-decadal time scale variability we are discussing here.  However, this apparent impulsive behavior explicitly highlights the fact that humanity is poking a complex, nonlinear system with GHG forcing – and that there are no guarantees to how the climate may respond. &lt;/p&gt;

The subject of my review has come up a few times, and one commenter cited this sentence from me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this, he proceeds to damn the "New Atheists" for "collapsing the distinction" between methodological and philosophical naturalism, and argues that Dawkins is taking a philosophical position and misusing science to claim it "entirely precludes God's existence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the commenter asks, "My question is, did you in fact say that Dawkins uses science to 'entirely preclude God's existence?'"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is Chris Mooney's dumbfounding reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;we use that phrase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
although it is not attributed to dawkins.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
i've read dawkins book in some detail, and our objection is to his making god's existence a scientific question. i realize he does not ascribe full certainty to his atheistic conclusion--but he claims he can reason scientifically about god's existence. we're saying that a lot of theologians, philosophers, etc, would say that's a category error.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
i really have to ask that you read our book, rather than its misrepresentation in skewed reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This annoys me. Mooney can disagree with me, he can argue his side all he wants, but to accuse me of misrepresenting his book is inaccurate. I will now quote the entire damn paragraph from the Mooney/Kirshenbaum book. You tell me if I have in any way misrepresented what he said with my short summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But much like the anti-evolutionists do, the New Atheists often seek to collapse the distinction between methodological and philosophical naturalism. In &lt;i&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/i&gt;, for instance, Richard Dawkins makes the dubious claim that the existence of God is, as he puts it, "unequivocally a scientific question." Quite a lot of philosophers -- and scientists -- would disagree. It is one thing to say that scientific norms and practices preclude ascribing any explanatory force to God in, say, the movement of atoms, or the function of DNA. It's quite another to say they entirely preclude God's existence. In rejecting God or any other supernatural entity, Dawkins is taking a &lt;i&gt;philosophical&lt;/i&gt; position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mooney has promised a reply to my comments later this week. He should take his time, or not even bother; I think his tactics have been foreshadowed enough here that I'm not going to find much of interest in his response. Although at this rate he may end up simply disavowing everything they actually wrote and trying to pretend it was a completely different book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if there’s one man you can count on to take a firm stand against pleasure-providing, consensual activities, it’s the Pope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s not terribly surprising to find him weighing in against &lt;a href="http://www.zenit.org/article-26428?l=english"&gt;drug use&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In particular, the Holy Father noted Mexico’s work to eliminate “violence, drug trafficking, and inequality and poverty, which are fertile ground for delinquency.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can already hear you objecting that the Pope is only opposed to drug “trafficking,” not drug &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt;, to which I will simply point out that without drug “trafficking,” there is no drug use, except maybe for drugs that you grow yourself in your closet using a hydroponic setup that you lied to the sales clerk and told was for “legitimate vegetables,” drugs that you made in a trailer in the woods from common household items you bought at supermarkets and hardware stores, and model airplane cement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you might be wondering why exactly the Pope cares about drug use.  After all, the College of Cardinals has been known to &lt;a href="http://www.smokemachines.net/papal-smoke.shtml"&gt;smoke some wacky stuff&lt;/a&gt; during papal elections, and Benedict is himself supposed to have experimented in the past with &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/12/28/eveningnews/main26314.shtml"&gt;Nazi crank&lt;/a&gt;.  And you’d think that as a well-known Cypress Hill fan, he’d have more appreciation for the “bubonic chronic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s possible that nostalgia-minded priests are encouraged by the parallels between the War on Drugs and the &lt;a href="http://www.drugwar.com/inquisition.shtm"&gt;Inquisition&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, drugs have “an &lt;a href="http://www.cannabis.net/justsayno/"&gt;obvious affiliation&lt;/a&gt; with the desires of Satan,” especially his desire to eat at White Castle.  And probably the Church views the War on Drugs as a useful proxy for its war against &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1671984,00.html"&gt;Santa Muerte&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the internet, though, it’s primarily because Pope Benedict &lt;a href="http://www.popebenedictantichrist.com/"&gt;is the antichrist&lt;/a&gt;, who will necessarily &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/06/science.religion"&gt;support the drug war&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“If cannabis was one of the main ingredients of the ancient anointing oil _ and receiving this oil is what made Jesus the Christ and his followers Christians, then persecuting those who use cannabis could be considered anti-Christ,” Mr Bennett concludes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have edited it to distill it down to the essential issues of their relationship. To summarize their background: They are both scientists, currently finishing their PhDs at the same university.  He has a few months to go, and she has two years.  He is 29 and she is a little younger.  Pressure for finding work in their field as soon as they graduate is beginning to build, and he feels that he must reach a decision about their relationship within six months. Where I paraphrase him, I use parentheses and italics.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My problem, briefly, is that my current girlfriend (of two years) is a  theist, I’m an atheist, and we can’t quite agree on how to raise the hypothetical children we’d someday like to have. I believe my  girlfriend has the additional problem that she isn’t completely   comfortable with the fact that I think her religious beliefs are   nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve both compromised our plans for our hypothetical children some, with me saying I could allow the kids to go to church sometimes, but preferably UU, and her saying UU would be okay (although she still wants to go to an Episcopal church herself sometimes). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appear to  have reached a stumbling block on prayer, however. I’m adamantly  against having small kids pray, because they have no idea what’s going  on and it can get weird behaviors ingrained in them before they have much of a filter. She’s apparently not very flexible on wanting them to pray. There may be other issues; it’s an ongoing conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discussed religion a great deal at the beginning of our relationship. As we talked, however, we ran into two problems from my perspective: First, she couldn’t actually define God in any coherent way. &lt;em&gt;(and I think children should not be taught a concept so complex and vague that even adults cannot understand it.)&lt;/em&gt;  The second problem was that she admitted that when she really started to think about these things it did make her question the existence of God, which was horribly uncomfortable for her, and so even if there were no or even contrary evidence, she was going to believe in God anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I respect her as a person, I respect her intelligence, I respect her reading, her hobbies, her friendliness, her morality, her research, her thoughtfulness, her charity, and more. But there’s no way I’m going to respect her papered-over cognitive dissonance. This nonsense of religion is very important to her, however, and she’s not sure if she wants to commit fully to someone who will never share it with her.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we are very compatible apart from the religion   issue. I’ve never met anyone I mesh with as well as her, and I really   don’t want to lose her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I have some work prospects in my field out of state and overseas, but I’d be willing to take temporary work nearby to wait for her to finish her PhD if I felt more confident that we have a future together.)&lt;/em&gt; I love my career, but I love her more. My girlfriend and I talk about this stuff, we respect each other, we both want marriage to be a life-long thing. I’m not sure  what advice you could give here, but as a former marriage and family counselor, I imagine you might have some.  Thanks,    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disbelieving on a Deadline
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Disbelieving,&lt;br&gt;
Firstly, I apologize if my editing, summarizing and paraphrasing does not feel entirely accurate from your point of view. Let’s summarize the pluses and minuses of your current relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plus:&lt;/b&gt; You love her, you mesh well, and you respect her many excellent qualities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minus:&lt;/b&gt; You do not respect her religious ideas, which you consider to be nonsense and self-kidding.  Her religion is  very important to her, and she’s uncomfortable knowing how you feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plus:&lt;/b&gt; The two of you have hypothetically arrived at a compromise about religious exposure for your future children, most likely involving UU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minus:&lt;/b&gt;  The two of you have reached an impasse about teaching your future children to pray.  She is adamantly for it, you are adamantly against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plus:&lt;/b&gt; The two of you are able to talk extensively about these issues of religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minus:&lt;/b&gt; Talking extensively about these things is beginning to make her feel doubtful, anxious and obstinate about her faith.  This may shut down your dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plus:&lt;/b&gt; Both of you agree on marriage being a life-long commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minus:&lt;/b&gt; Both of you have serious doubts that you will ever be able to be comfortable and compatible with your differences if you marry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pluses and minuses seem to cancel each other out, adding up to zero.  Zero does not mean “no chance for you,” it means “neutral.”  The two of you can continue to enjoy each other’s company as you are, unless the two of you decide that you must marry. The only reason to marry would be to have children, and these non-existent people are complicating your lives.  Don’t let them.  Considering all the issues about children now, before you have established careers, is very premature.  By creating an irreconcilable conflict about this now, you are stealing trouble from the future, a future that for many other unknown reasons may not come to pass.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you both agree to shelve the prospect of kids for now, which takes away the need to marry, which in turn takes away the pressure to find agreement on so many things.  Continue to enjoy how well you mesh, talk gently about your differences, and let some time go by as you finish your doctorates and start your careers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re 29, but believe me, you are both still very young.  So many parts of your personalities are still developing and changing.  As the two of you continue to change and grow, you might converge or you might diverge. Only time will tell, and you don’t have to rush things by pulling the future into the present. The future will get here of its own accord. What you will be to each other some day is not yet knowable. In the meantime, the present contains this interesting and loving couple.  Just appreciate each other in the fullness and richness of the present moment. &lt;/p&gt;

Then, as suddenly as it began, it disappeared---no ILI, no positive nasal swabs for influenza A (and hence H1N1/swine flu)---just the usual strep throat, poison ivy, ankle sprains, etc.  So what happened?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new influenza A/H1N1 (hereafter called "H1N1" or "swine" flu) emerged early this year and rapidly became pandemic.  It caused a "second" flu season, ramping up just as the usual winter flu epidemic was winding down.  This graph shows vividly the two-peak flu season we have this year due to the new flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/upload/2009/07/what_happened_to_the_flu/WhoLab26.GIF" width="450" height="350"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From &lt;a href="http://cdc.gov/flu/weekly/"&gt;the CDC's weekly flu surveillance site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/05/swine_flu_lessons_from_past_pa.php"&gt;As others have discussed&lt;/a&gt;, it is not unusual for a novel, pandemic flu strain to come in waves. As the first wave of H1N1 leaves the northern hemisphere and &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/world/americas/02argentina.html"&gt;takes root in the southern hemisphere &lt;/a&gt;for their flu season, what may we expect next?  Or is the "first wave" even done with us yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible answer to the sudden absence in swine flu in my daily work may be the end of the school year, the removal of kids from the crowded environments that they inhabit during the rest of the year.  And where do these kids go when not in school? &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E0D7133AF93AA15755C0A96F9C8B63&amp;amp;sec=&amp;amp;spon="&gt;Many of them go to summer camps&lt;/a&gt;, where H1N1 may find a comfortable place to hang out.  It's still early in the camping season, but in parts of the country where camps start early, they are seeing cases of H1N1 flu.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief google search reveals different ways in which summer camps are dealing with influenza-like illnesses.  For example, in Ontario, Canada, health officials recommend against testing for flu and base guidelines on clinical circumstances.  Some camps have temporarily shut down, others have sent sick children home, and others have implemented screening, control, and isolation programs within the camp, especially those that are geographically isolated.  One summer camp sent out this letter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As has always been the case at this time every summer, four campers have presented themselves to our Health Centre with fevers and/or flu symptoms. And as is always the case, our MASH staff have responded expertly and quickly to provide a comfortable and isolated space for these kids to begin the process of getting better.

&lt;p&gt;Sending kids home to recuperate is one of the options that we have available to us in this sort of situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have decided it to be prudent to send these campers home for a few days until they are cleared by their doctor to return. Our motivation is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.To provide the most comfortable space for kids to get well and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.To protect our overall (and overwhelmingly!) healthy population from acquiring any contagious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four of the families have been contacted and are cooperating with this decision. We are helping with their camper's transportation to their hometown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we are acting particularly cautiously in this summer of 2009 while fears of the spread of H1N1 flu through the cities remain significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wish to inform you that there are a number of practices that we initiated this year to protect our population:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Everyone coming in and out of camp from the "outside world" is screened before being admitted to camp. (This includes staff on days off, canoe trips, field trips, inter-camp, and individual "ins and outs")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definition of "screen": Their temperature is taken, they are asked a series of diagnostic questions, and they are watched while washing their hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.The cabin groups (including staff) of campers with a fever are screened twice in the first day and then periodically over the next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.We are delivering specific, repeated, and targeted education about coughing safely and proper handwashing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this communication is strictly to keep you informed, to let you know that there are some kids who are sick at camp, and to let you know that we are doing our very best to take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect our campers and staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2009/07/03/10022341.html"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One camp, which news reports did not identify by name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, voluntarily shut down after experiencing a large flu outbreak.  This does not, however, appear to be the norm.  After communicating with several summer camps across North America, it would appear that many are experiencing small outbreaks of ILI which they are containing within the camp environment, and have implemented increased prevention and control programs.  

&lt;p&gt;What's the lesson here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As has been known for at least a century, crowding helps the spread  of influenza.  It would also appear that aggressive prevention and control programs can mitigate this spread.  During the current pandemic, should we be keeping kids away from schools, camps, and other areas where flu can be spread?  Is this pandemic worrisome enough that we should, during this Depression, halt necessary economic and educational activities?  Remember, when a kid stays home from school or camp, a parent stays home from work or vacation, both of which are income-generating activities.  These sorts of questions were asked during the 1918 flu pandemic, which attacked while the US was preparing for and fighting a war.  It was not clear to health officials then what necessary activities should be curtailed to help stop the spread of flu (and of course politics made decisions doubly difficult).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, time and science will give us more insight into these questions.  If there is to be a "second wave" of H1N1 in the fall/winter flu season, our current experiences may serve as a guide for how to control the next phase of the pandemic, should it arrive.  Meanwhile, my kiddo is going to camp, I'm going to work, and life continues on nearly as always.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I do carry a bottle of hand sanitizer with me wherever I go, and I never touch a doorknob.  I'm not so fond of shaking hands, either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/what_happened_to_the_flu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/EeYSNp8HmnE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247415878565"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/12/the-sunday-snog-2/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1ec1922b05dd017c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="science of kissing"/><category term="cheetah"/><category term="The Sunday Snog"/><title type="html">The Sunday Snog</title><published>2009-07-12T16:17:38Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T16:17:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/12/the-sunday-snog-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.allposters.com/-sp/A-Mother-s-Love-Posters_i358164_.htm" title="mothers-kiss.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Believe it or not, I was even on a panel! While I'm gone,  I'll probably manage to do a new post or two, but, in the meantime, while I'm away communing with fellow skeptics at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.)

&lt;a href="http://www.newstarget.com/"&gt;Mike Adams&lt;/a&gt; is an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I said it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adams runs the &lt;a href="http://www.newstarget.com/"&gt;NewsTarget &lt;/a&gt;website, a repository for all  things "alternative" medicine. In it, he rails against "conventional" medicine as utterly useless and touts all manner of woo as the "cure" for a variety of diseases. I generally ignore his website these days because I fear that reading it regularly will cause me to lose too many neurons, and, as I get older, I want to hold on to my what neurons I have remaining for as long as possible, or, if I must lose them, to do so in a pleasurable way, perhaps as a result of a fine bottle of wine. But, then &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/07/alternative_medicine_quacks_de.php"&gt;MarkH&lt;/a&gt; had to go and point out an example where Mike Adams has surpassed himself in the amount of sheer stupidity and logical fallacies packed into a single article. The article is entitled,  &lt;a href="http://www.newstarget.com/021922.html"&gt;The false gods of scientific medicine revealed: It's a cult, not a science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stupid, it really does burn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/07/alternative_medicine_quacks_de.php"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt;'s done a  great job of taking this idiocy down, but does that mean that there's nothing left for me?

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;'What word do you hate and why?' is the intriguing question put to a selection of poets by the Ledbury festival. Philip Wells's reply is the winner for me - 'pulchritude' is certainly up there on my blacklist. He even explains his animosity in suitably poetic terms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; "it violates all the magical impulses of balanced onomatopoeic language - it of course means "beautiful", but its meaning is nothing of the sort, being stuffed to the brim with a brutally latinate cudgel of barbaric consonants. If consonants represent riverbanks and vowels the river's flow, this is the word equivalent of the bottomless abyss of dry bones, where demons gather to spit acid."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;For Geraldine Monk, "it's got to be 'redacted' which makes me feel totally sick. It's a brutish sounding word. It doesn't flow, it prods at you in a nasty manner."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Both these poets understand that the key to words that make you feel nauseous is not the meaning - it's easy, after all, to hate the word 'torture' – but something else entirely. Something idiosyncratic, something about the way the word feels in your mouth as you say it. The horrors of 'membrane', for instance. Or the eccentricity of 'gusset'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The expression of negative lexical affect, in the form of &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=%22word+rage%22"&gt;word rage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=%22word+aversion%22"&gt;word aversion&lt;/a&gt;, is a &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002625.html"&gt;major concern&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002626.html"&gt;anglophone intellectual culture&lt;/a&gt;; and so I wasn't surprised to see that Ms. Pauli's post got &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/jul/07/words-wince-hated-poets?showallcomments=true"&gt;1108 comments&lt;/a&gt; (so far). In comparison, a post about how "The online Codex Sinaiticus changes book scholarship for good" garnered only 4 comments, a post about Dan Brown's new book got 10, and even "Tips for titillating reading", which tells us that "middle-aged women want to read books about sex more than anything else, according to a new survey", got a mere 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And despite Ms. Pauli's  plain statement that she's talking about cases where "the key is not the meaning", but rather "something about the way the word feels in your mouth as you say it", at least half the comments are focused on senses or usages that are associated with disliked groups or ideas, or that are seen as irritatingly novel or non-literal. In other words, word rage wins, and to hell with the poets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Leverage - whenever it is used in a situation that does not physically  involve a long stick, a fulcrum and shifting a heavy weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;way forward; national debate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Partner - when used in a non-commercial sense. If you mean wife/husband/girlfriend/boyfriend, then just say that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;quot;Like&amp;quot; in, like, the way, like, its used nowadays….. please just shoot me now!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;On the side of huge lorries: 'logistics' and 'solutions'. Both just mean haulage. Probably.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Context is all, certainly, but I cant stand the word ‘comedic, which seems to have replaced perfectly serviceable words such as ‘funny, ‘comedy and ‘comic to no apparent purpose. Its weirdly jarring in sentences discussing the ‘comedic possibilities of a scene or the ‘comedic talents of a performer. It makes my teeth ache and must be stopped.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"liase" as a verb, also "liasing". ugh. it makes my spine go crunchy. oh, let me add "wicked" - just because I'm a grouchy old git.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;#39;Blogosphere&amp;#39; is one word that makes me wince, and the phrase that has me cringing more than most is &amp;quot;Now, more than ever…&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Medal, when used as a verb by American sports commentators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2009/jul/07/words-wince-hated-poets?commentid=2d92406f-c28a-43d9-bee9-0b01517da8c9"&gt;favorite&lt;/a&gt; , among the small fraction that I've read, was contributed by greenpaua:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;[…] sufficient (why not say enough? ie use one syllable instead of three)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More raw material for someone's (as yet unwritten) study of &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004244.html"&gt;the social psychology of linguistic naming and shaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Investigate.jpg"&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; at the start of Pauli's post is captioned "Pointing the finger at pulchritude: 'a brutally latinate cudgel of barbaric consonants'", even though the the (stock?) photo actually shows a finger pointing at the word &lt;em&gt;investigate&lt;/em&gt;.

On one hand we have fabulously expensive and epic documentaries such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Earth_(TV_series)"&gt;Planet Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, while at the other end of the spectrum, there's "entertainment television with a science motif" such as the dreadful &lt;em&gt;Brainiac: Science Abuse&lt;/em&gt;. BBC's &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt;, a landmark series in its own right, has attracted &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/10/27/bbc_horizon/"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt; for a drift into what some see as sensationalist drama - a move no doubt influenced by the success of Channel 4's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/bodyshock/episode-guide"&gt;Bodyshock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series, which gave us such titles as Half Ton Mum and the Girl with Two Faces&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly then, there's room for an accessible, science-led TV show for the whole family.

a fine talk to Skeptics in the Pub in London&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So by the summer, chiropractic was for me just another topic which skeptics had discussed in a pub one evening. It was of no greater interest to me than, say, horoscopes, ghosthunting, or crop circles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For, although my lovely critic &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/06/hello-to-dr-george-lewith.html"&gt;Dr George Lewith&lt;/a&gt; has accused me of being &lt;em&gt;"a prominent member of the anti-CAM brigade"&lt;/em&gt;, I really have never had any particular interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of what I now know about CAM has come from dealing with legal threats from CAM practitioners to critics; and so whilst I now know about chiropractic and homeopathy, I still know little about - say - osteopathy, reiki or acupuncture, for the simple reason that practitioners of the latter do not seem to threaten to sue people when criticised to the same level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one summer day, I get a call from my friend &lt;a href="http://www.gold.ac.uk/psychology/staff/french/"&gt; Professor Chris French&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;He tells me that Simon Singh is being sued for libel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had met Simon Singh, around the time of his fateful &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; article, when &lt;a href="http://www.skeptic.org.uk/randi/"&gt; the great and amazing James Randi came to speak in London&lt;/a&gt;. At the dinner afterwards I was lucky enough to sit by Simon Singh, and he cheerfully and charmingly fired questions at me about the relationship between skepticism and the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I was shocked and supportive when Chis French told me that this cheerful and charming chap was now being sued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I was still "in-house" at time, I was not able to advise or act for Simon Singh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I wondered what I could do to help from the outside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I straight away realised that as a media and communications lawyer I could offer an informed and supportive commentary on this Blog. For although I know little about CAM, I do know about libel law. And, unlike many lawyers, I enjoy writing about law in a popular way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as I read further into the case, and finally got hold of the original text, my general wish to support Simon Singh transformed into a stark and fierce passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was immediately obvious on reading the alleged libel that the BCA case was deeply misconceived.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before I explain the cause of my passion, I would just like to set the BCA case in some legal context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have had the good fortune to sit in the same conference rooms and offices as some of the best media litigators in the City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And of many things I have learned from these experiences, two are salutary:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. just because a case can be brought it doesn't mean it should be brought; and&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. never, never bring a case unless you are fully prepared to fight it to the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Think about feeding Gremlins after midnight...)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad litigation arises when either - or both - of these lessons are disregarded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have said before that the BCA do not have a weak case; and the BCA - and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;- lawyers have so far been proved "right" on this narrow point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, it is a case which should not have been brought. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing important would have been gained by a BCA legal victory - or even defeat - whilst the crucial underlying issue of the adequacy of the evidence base was left unresolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the BCA clearly are bewildered that Simon Singh refused to surrender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, the most telling statement made by the BCA from the &lt;em&gt;plethora&lt;/em&gt; of verbiage in their increasingly barmy and desperate press releases, was a snide remark about Simon Singh saying he had the money and time to fight the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was like the school bully realising that someone is both willing and able to take him or her on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My impression - my guess - is that like a number of such claimants, the BCA did not really think past bringing the claim. To use the dreadful management-speak term, they thought this would be a &lt;em&gt;"quick win"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, with this background, it was never going to be a good case for the BCA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the source of my passion was nothing to do with CAM or because I had met and liked Simon Singh or that I saw a case wrongly brought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was, for me, a free speech issue regarding public health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In essence, Simon Singh's article was critical of the evidence base for certain treatments for children's ailments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As such, it is my fundamental view that - absent malice - such statements should be published without fear of legal action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, my view is that the law should be there to &lt;em&gt;protect&lt;/em&gt; such statements not &lt;em&gt;hinder&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Debate about public health - and public safety and police powers - should be as free as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I stated when I set up the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/group.php?gid=33457048634&amp;amp;ref=ts"&gt; Facebook support group&lt;/a&gt; (which, incidentally, is now too large for messages to be sent to its members!):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;   "An informed and responsible science writer should be able to write about genuine concerns on an important public health issue (the correct treatment for children) without the threat and expense of High Court libel claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   "Even if he is wrong, it would be surely enough for the BCA to simply show their supporting evidence. But they are suing him instead".&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key passage here is "&lt;em&gt;even if he is wrong&lt;/em&gt;" - I know little about CAM and did not know if he was correct (though it is now clear to me that he is), but he should have been permitted to raise the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, the two sentences in dispute should have been properly sub-edited by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;into being libel-proof - it would have taken five minutes at most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, given they were published, the BCA should have accepted &lt;em&gt;The Guardian's&lt;/em&gt; offer of a "right to reply".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or they could have published their evidence base on their website.  Perhaps they could have had a conference to discuss Simon SIngh's claims, which I think he would have eagerly attended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was not until Simon Singh forced the BCA with his wide-ranging &lt;a href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2008/11/on-putting-chiropractic-on-trial.html"&gt; Defence&lt;/a&gt; to set out its purported evidence base for the six children's ailments that the BCA even started trying to substantiate their claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(I understand the "&lt;em&gt;plethora&lt;/em&gt;" originated in the BCA's attempt to undermine Simon Singh's "&lt;em&gt;Fair Comment&lt;/em&gt;" defence - a defence which the BCA strongly opposed.  So, had it not been for this defence, we still would not know the BCA's evidence base.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when a case is misconceived, disasters can occur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, I never expected the spectacular mess which the BCA has caused by their lawsuit.  It really does seem to get worse every week or so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, the BCA could sue, but it is now obvious to everyone that they should not have done so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Libel law should not have any role in science generally; but it certainly should be kept out of discussions about public health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is where "free speech" should be a given, but it is not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And so that is why BCA v Singh matters to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/freedebate"&gt;&lt;img height="66" alt="free debate" src="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/images/sas-libel-2.png" width="180" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4762827614191702843-5709895061987421751?l=jackofkent.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Jack of Kent)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Jack of Kent</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247404007213"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BoredLunatic/~3/46cpaxRqr34/bursting-and-neural-information_12.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/251f79664616a769</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Bursting and neural information (continued)</title><published>2009-07-12T07:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T07:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/qtM5sB2O2pI/bursting-and-neural-information_12.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BoredLunatic/~3/46cpaxRqr34/bursting-and-neural-information_12.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;What happens when you take a very boring mechanism and combine it with a mechanism only marginally less boring? A really really interesting set of behaviors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://boredlunatic.blogspot.com/2009/07/bursting-and-neural-information.html"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; I discussed one paper discussing why neurons might burst, on the abstract level - not &lt;i&gt;how bursting comes about&lt;/i&gt; but &lt;i&gt;how the brain might exploit bursting&lt;/i&gt;.  That was one of three papers I've read discussing the phenomenon of resonance frequencies in neurons.  &lt;a href="http://osiris.rutgers.edu/BuzsakiHP/Labmeeting/PDFs/HutcheonYaromTINS2000.pdf"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the second.  This paper briefly looks at the different ionic mechanisms and how their dynamics support resonance properties.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Typically, neurons generate electrical spikes by shifting sodium, calcium, and potassium ions in and out of the cell membrane using ion pumps.  Certain mechanisms on the cellular biology level can account for the phenomena of resonance frequencies/frequency preference, in particular, slow-activating membrane currents can account for resonance.  In fact, a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; slow-activating membrane current can do the trick.  From an every-day experience perspective, you can get resonance by taking a &lt;i&gt;very boring&lt;/i&gt; neural mechanism - adaptation - and slap a &lt;i&gt;slightly more interesting &lt;/i&gt;neural mechanism on top of it - facilitation - and you can get &lt;i&gt;really really interesting &lt;/i&gt;behavior.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The phenomena of adaptation is well-studied in neuroscience - the property many neurons exhibit of ignoring inputs after awhile.  Reasonably, one would imagine neurons should wait for &lt;i&gt;changes&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;unchanging&lt;/i&gt; stimuli - if it didn't work that way, we would constantly be paying attention to how our shoes feel on the bottom of our feet instead of, say, paying attention for potential predators because the brain couldn't damp out that constant, unchanging stimuli.  An analogy is when you look at a white spot on a dark background for a long period of time, and then look away - a dark spot where the white spot once was follows your vision.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(This isn't a direct description, it's an analogy - that particular dark spot is actually a consequence of the photoreceptors in your retina, not neural adaptation.) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another phenomenon, however, is somewhat less studied in neuroscience - facilitation.  This is when a neuron will actually &lt;i&gt;boost&lt;/i&gt; a weak signal.  In other words, you have two mechanisms - one which ignores novel signals (facilitation) and one which ignores old signals (adaptation).  Put those together?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You get a peak in behavior for middle-of-the-road input.  You get resonance frequencies, frequency preference, band-pass filtering, whatever you like to call it.  The authors show that this occurs in model neurons by considering the actual ionic mechanisms that bring this property about, and they also show that this occurs in actual recordings of neurons.  Unfortunately, the cell-biology specifics that are responsible I'm not going to get into unless a reader is interested - primarily because I have taken what I needed (a model) from the paper, but also because it would require a post or two on the basics of neural membrane voltage mechanisms before I could discuss the concepts presented in the paper without fear of losing you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=Trends+in+Neurosciences&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1016%2FS0166-2236%2800%2901547-2&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=Resonance%2C+oscillation+and+the+intrinsic+frequency+preferences+of+neurons&amp;amp;rft.issn=01662236&amp;amp;rft.date=2000&amp;amp;rft.volume=23&amp;amp;rft.issue=5&amp;amp;rft.spage=216&amp;amp;rft.epage=222&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0166223600015472&amp;amp;rft.au=Hutcheon%2C+B.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Neuroscience%2CCognitive+Neuroscience"&gt;Hutcheon, B.

Anyone who reads it knows that Andrew has continuously called out &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Palin&lt;/strong&gt; on her bullshit ever since &lt;strong&gt;John McCain&lt;/strong&gt; picked her last year, one of only a handful of journalists to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, Andrew, a theist, and &lt;strong&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/strong&gt; had a &lt;a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Secular-Philosophies/Is-Religion-Built-Upon-Lies.aspx"&gt;public conversation about the nature of God&lt;/a&gt; a couple years ago.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading his posts regarding Palin, I noticed a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew is constantly astounded that anyone takes her seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He believes it would be a mistake if an entire group of people (the GOP in this case) supports her wholeheartedly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He wonders why people in high places (i.e. the mainstream media) aren’t asking the right questions — they just seem to let Palin get away with everything, &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/07/the-odd-lies-of-sarah-palin-a-roundup.html"&gt;including the hypocrisy and lies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We know that far too many people still support her despite her never-ending list of flaws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He considers McCain grossly irresponsible for choosing her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely enough, I think many atheists have the same feelings about God &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially when it comes to politicians who want to turn this country into a variation of a Christian theocracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe I shouldn’t have been as surprised when I &lt;a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/06/a-party-of-one.html"&gt;found this out&lt;/a&gt; about Palin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… When Trig was born, Palin wrote an e-mail letter to friends and relatives, describing the belated news of her pregnancy and detailing Trig’s condition; she wrote the e-mail not in her own name but in God’s, and signed it “Trig’s Creator, Your Heavenly Father.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to shoot down or expand the metaphor.&lt;br&gt;

The book neatly follows up Mooney’s best seller, &lt;em&gt;The Republican War on Science&lt;/em&gt;, into a broader, nonpartisan narrative of an entire nation enamored by the nifty gizmos and life saving applications of science, yet saddled with a long history of anti-intellectualism that periodically spills over into open contempt. It’s a dose of stiff but sorely needed medicine for baby boomers and genx’ers who grew up during a short thaw in that icy antiscience trend by way of a cold war, a hot space race, and one great communicator named Carl Sagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Sheril Kirshenbaum</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247391387144"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_349.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e9419c96c1721940</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-07-12T09:10:09Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T09:10:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Godp8Do9HK4/clock_quotes_349.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/clock_quotes_349.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things which danger does to you after a time is, well, to kill emotion.

The original title for this post was going to be "never say never" but the above title just seemed more apropos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42 inches is equivalent to 3 1/2 feet. And 42 inches is the size of the boogie board I was hastily dispatched to purchase, per Charlie's request yesterday while we were at the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years, we had three boogie boards, a big blue one (I suspect it was 42 inches; can't remember) and two smaller red ones (35 inchers, most likely). We'd bought one red one at a beach variety store: Last summer, it was thin and faded and cracking. The big blue one was without its strap, which had gotten detached for some reason or other, and then promptly misplaced, as have many things in our back-and-forth visits to the Jersey Shore over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regularly chronicled since I started blogging in June of 2005, my son Charlie adores the ocean. He first dipped his feet in the Atlantic when he was about six months old back in October of 1997 and, except for the summer of 1998 when we moved from St. Louis to St. Paul, we've taken him to the ocean and, specifically, the fabled Jersey Shore. Charlie has always loved the water. He doesn't run in fully clothed (as he did into Lake Excelsior in Minnesota on the 4th of July in 1999) any more, but he's clearly most at ease and just in his element in the water, and most of all in the ocean. Charlie was 6 when he learned to swim in a local swimming pool but he'd been in waves over his head since he was little courtesy of Jim's arms and back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around that time we got that red boogie board and Jim held Charlie in the surf and tried to get him onto the board, held by me. Holding onto a wet board in salt water waves with other people splashing and running around and squealing and yelling and potentially crashing into you with their boogie boards---this is definitely an &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/proprioception_and_the_brain"&gt;activity involving a fair amount of gross motor planning&lt;/a&gt;. In those first days of boogie-boarding, Jim pulled the board by the strap or held the board with both hands and walked backwards, while I followed and helped Charlie regain his grip or scooped him up when he slid off. Sometimes Jim would drag Charlie-on-the-board out into the waves and try to give him a sense of how it'd feel to get a ride. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life_in_the_slow_lane"&gt;Slowly, slowly&lt;/a&gt;---and buoyed by the kindly encouragement of others (one &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/we_ride_bikes_together"&gt;New York City firefighter&lt;/a&gt; in particular)---Charlie was able to hang onto the board.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jim towed him out into the waves and frequently had to recover both a boy who'd gone under the waves and the board so it wouldn't bang into Charlie. Often Charlie would get back to the sand, rip the wrist strap off, and tell us "all done!" and "hot shower." But over time he was able to keep himself on the board and we added the two other boards to our collection. And three summers ago Jim and Charlie started to go out together both on their own boards, often with Jim holding his board and towing Charlie out with his other hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie does more every year we go to the beach. Last year he carried the board out himself and I risked ruining yet another digital camera standing in the shallows and trying to get pictures of Jim and Charlie catching a wave in, side by side. Two summers ago Charlie had his &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-surfing-challenge/"&gt;first surfing lesson&lt;/a&gt; on a 9-foot-board; last summer, at his &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/surfs-up-with-charlie/"&gt;second lesson&lt;/a&gt;, he got himself into a kneeling position on the board, but said no to standing up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we took the backroads to the beach. There's always traffic going down, especially on the Garden State Parkway, and Jim's mantra is "better to be in motion," and so on local roads we went. Charlie didn't seem to mind being on unfamiliar routes. We made it in good time and Charlie had a huge grin on his face as we neared the beach. The waves were rougher than they were last weekend and he went in slowly after Jim had swum out pretty far; I followed. Charlie was swimming under the waves and frowning at us when we urged him to swim between the lifeguard's flags, and turning to jump just as a big foamy wave hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he said, "Boogie board."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't have the three boogie boards mentioned at the start of this post anymore. Last summer, the old red one became puckered and cracked, the other red one got left behind at an outdoor shower, and I don't remember what happened to the big blue one. So we have been boogie board-less and Jim and I had just been figuring we'd wait till it was time to get another one----and yesterday at 3.15pm was the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hastened to a surf shop to get a board, with Jim and Charlie remaining on the beach. Jim suggested getting one about 35-39 inches and most of the boards I saw were a bit longer. Factoring in Charlie's height I figured, why not, and chose a 42-inch turquoise blue board with a Hawai'ian motif. And drove back as fast as I could with the 35 mph speed limit in mind (and numerous cop cars around to remind me about it). I pulled off the plastic and sped back to the beach where I saw Charlie and Jim in the waves and soon I was handing over the board to Jim who fastened the velcro around Charlie's wrist and Charlie picked up the board and headed into the waves. And turned around and put himself flat on the board just in time to catch a wave and get a smooth ride in, and picked up the board and went back out and caught another wave; repeat, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It often seems that Charlie (and Jim and I by extension) get at least a little &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/beachsick-boy/"&gt;beachsick&lt;/a&gt; every year until it's June and we can venture down the Garden State Parkway to the beach again. The water is cold in June but by August, when we head down the shore for a two-week stay in a rented beach house, it's warmed up quite a lot. After we left the beach yesterday, Jim rented a canoe, lifejackets, and two paddles and I know we'll be scheduling at least one surfing lesson for Charlie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it'll be the year he stands up on the board and maybe not. He'll tell us what he's ready for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Certainly, his new Hawai'ian boogie board).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247385689581"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/tam7_respectful_insolence_meetup.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af175ec5d068c95c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">TAM7 Respectful Insolence meetup?</title><published>2009-07-12T08:30:20Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T08:30:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/8Nhkl2tk7Cs/tam7_respectful_insolence_meetup.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/tam7_respectful_insolence_meetup.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m back from the Penn &amp;amp; Teller Show at the Rio. It was, as usual, highly entertaining. I haven&amp;#39;t seen P&amp;amp;T since sometime in the late 1990s in Chicago, but they&amp;#39;re just as good as I remember them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next issue: Shy and retiring putz that I am, it never occurred to me that any of my readers might want a meetup until one reader asked me about it yesterday. Perhaps my thoughts were colored by the memory of the couple of times before when I tried to do this with embarrassingly minimal to nonexistent responses. Judging from Twitter, though, there are at least a handful of you out there who, for FSM knows what reason, want to meet up with me. (Trust me, I'm not nearly as interesting in person as I am here on the blog.) Since I'll still be at TAM7, the least I can do is give it a try. I was thinking Sunday sometimes around 11:30 PM or noon (i.e., lunchtime) outside the conference hall. (I still want to make it to the Million Dollar Challenge at 1 PM.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're still at TAM and have any interest in a meetup, either leave a message here, e-mail me, or respond to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/oracknows/status/2592859378"&gt;my Tweet last night&lt;/a&gt; about a meetup.

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the focuses of the DSM-V Neurodevelopmental Disorders Work Group is whether the mutual exclusion of ADD/ADHD and ASD should remain or be lifted. Currently a person can not, according strictly to the letter of the DSM, be diagnosed with both neurodevelopmental disorders at once. The neurodevelopmental group is working on possible re-definitions of autism spectrum disorders for the new version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the DSM may currently place some restrictions on which letters can go with which other letters, this article from Times Online asks the question, "Does having a clutch of acronyms after their names help or hinder children with multiple behaviour problems?" and then proceeds to discuss kids being diagnosed with multiple neurodevelopmental and/or psychological disorders from the DSM including the ASD/ADD dual diagnosis. The article raised some interesting (to me anyway) different ideas about where the sudden explosion of DSM diagnoses might be coming from, including some non-medical ones such as changing social and cultural norms and misdiagnoses based on not properly looking at lifestyle (e.g. difficulty concentrating because of lack of sufficient sleep).&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247379374637"><id gr:original-id="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenimAndTweed/~3/Bd1Pkrc8_qA/sonar-gives-whales-bends.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cda682bf99f8dfbf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="All Topics"/><title type="html">Sonar gives whales the bends</title><published>2009-07-12T00:57:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-12T00:57:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ResearchBloggingAllEnglish/~3/1eMQP_fE6zw/sonar-gives-whales-bends.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenimAndTweed/~3/Bd1Pkrc8_qA/sonar-gives-whales-bends.html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.researchblogging.org/" type="html">&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_small.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/i&gt; has a cover article on &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12whales-t.html"&gt;human-whale interactions&lt;/a&gt;, with special attention to whales' cognitive, communicative, and social abilities. It's pretty neat stuff, and I started reading it with the intention of posting something about it with a title along the lines of "So long, and thanks for all the fish." But, rather than all the whales-as-fellow-sentients stuff, this early aside about the effects of navigational sonar on whales is what actually caught my attention:&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of the examinations performed on the [beached] Canary Islands whales, however, added a whole other, darker dimension to the whale-stranding mystery. In addition to bleeding around the whales’ brains and ears, scientists found lesions in their livers, lungs and kidneys, as well as nitrogen bubbles in their organs and tissue, all classic symptoms of a sickness that scientists had naturally assumed whales would be immune to: the bends.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiatluxe/110056687" title="Cuvier&amp;#39;s Beaked Whale on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/50/110056687_b09727746a_m_d.jpg" width="180px;" alt="" style="border:solid 1px #cccccc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:0.8em;margin-top:0px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A beached &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuvier%27s_Beaked_Whale"&gt;Cuvier's beaked whale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Photo by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fiatluxe/"&gt;fiat luxe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;That's right -- the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness"&gt;bends&lt;/a&gt;. As in the harmful effects of a rapid  decrease in atmospheric pressure associated with rising too rapidly from deep water to the surface, which can cause gasses dissolved in the bloodstream to come out of solution and form bubbles. Human divers take precautions to avoid "decompression sickness," but it's surprising to find that mammals who spend their lives underwater should run the same risk. The idea is that navigational sonar is so irritating or disorienting that it drives whales to the surface faster than is safe, and often kills them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Naturally, I went to Google Scholar: although the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/425575a"&gt;original report of "gas-bubble lesions" in beached whales [$-a]&lt;/a&gt; generated some &lt;a href="http://www.seaturtle.org/PDF/Jepson_2003_Nature.pdf"&gt;controversy [PDF]&lt;/a&gt; at first, the most recent review I could find seems to &lt;a href="http://www.whalescience.com/SDSU/My%20Work/CoxEtAl_BeakedWhaleReport2006.pdf"&gt;accept the diagnosis [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although no potential mechanisms can be eliminated at this stage, we highlight gas bubble formation mediated through a behavioural response as plausible and in need of intensive study.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The review cites a number of documented whale strandings closely associated with offshore naval maneuvers, and calls for, among other things, re-evaluating past records of strandings with an eye to whether sonar use may have been involved. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This, of course, is what prompted conservation groups to &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/us/29sonar.html"&gt;sue the U.S. Navy&lt;/a&gt; for investigation of the environmental impact of navigational sonar; the Supreme Court eventually ruled, regrettably, that the Navy's need for sonar use in training exercises trumps the requirements of federal environmental law. I'd followed the story when it originally unfolded, but never really understood exactly &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; whales were hurt by sonar -- I think I assumed they were just sort of driven onto beaches. So, my totally non-marine biologist, non-mammalogist reaction: wow. And, ugh.&lt;br&gt;

Believe it or not, I was even on a panel! While I'm gone,  I'll probably manage to do a new post or two, but, in the meantime, while I'm away communing with fellow skeptics at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I suppose I had better get ready for another e-mail with a wounded, puppy-dog, plaintive complaint of "I'm not really anti-vaccine" in it. You see, that's what has happened in the past a couple of times after I wrote about that pediatrician to the children of the stars (in particular &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/postholiday_the_stupid_it_burns_part_1_j.php"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;'s child) and ubiquitous go-to pediatrician whenever the media wants to hear some "skepticism" about the safety of vaccines, &lt;a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, it really, really bothers him when someone refers to him as being "anti-vaccine," but what other term fits him so well these days? After all, Dr. Gordon toes the anti-vaccine party line from Generation Rescue, Talk About Curing Autism, and, of course, the celebrity mom of his patient, and he has the "too many, too soon" spiel down pat. He shows up at rallies to give speeches to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/green_our_vaccines_anti-vaccine.php"&gt;parents carrying explicitly antivaccination signs&lt;/a&gt; proclaiming their children as "poisoned" and "damaged' by vaccines, one sign even referring to them as "weapons of mass destruction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what am I supposed to call Dr. Gordon, if not "anti-vaccine"? He hangs out with hard-core antivaccinationists--more than that, &lt;em&gt;leaders&lt;/em&gt; of the anti-vaccine movement--and talks the anti-vaccine talk so well. He's become the go-to interview whenever a lazy journalist wants some vaccine "skepticism" from a medical professional. What more does one need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day, once again Dr. Gordon demonstrated his skill with anti-vaccine talking points in this &lt;a href="http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2008/07/vaccine_experts?currentPage=2"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Cookie Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's painful to read such idiocy flowing from the lips of a physician. Indeed, it's even worse than listening to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/the_energizer_bunny_of_antievolution_1.php"&gt;Dr. Michael Egnor&lt;/a&gt; spew creationist nonsense hither and yon, because at least for Dr. Egnor evolution is not part of his area of expertise. For Dr. Gordon, vaccines should be considered part of his area expertise, but you'd never know it from the data-free, anecdote-filled nonsense he spouts.

grande"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:lucida grande"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are wounded, oh religion.&lt;br&gt;The still-warm blood runs down your side as you say it did your savior on the cross.&lt;br&gt;My Soldiers in white coats have maimed you.&lt;br&gt;They have crippled you, leaving you to limp away a casualty from the battlefield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, on the loser’s end, with My chipped and crimson sword laid at your throat, you plead for mercy.&lt;br&gt;You beg Me to spare your life.&lt;br&gt;You ask for compassion and for understanding from Me, Science.&lt;br&gt;You want to be held up and accepted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Know that I, Science, have no obligation to hear you.&lt;br&gt;Better it is that you should die, as all things old and decrepit.&lt;br&gt;But out of compassion and mercy, I grant you what you seek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I let you alone.&lt;br&gt;I let you go your way.&lt;br&gt;I spare you.&lt;br&gt;But like a fool, you press your luck and demand more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of running away with your tale between your legs, with a morsel of thankfulness, and what little dignity you have left intact, you debase yourself.&lt;br&gt;You whine and complain.&lt;br&gt;You want your doctrines to be accepted in the universities and Institutions of Science and higher learning as viable theories, if not Scientific Truths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You ask, “Why does science have to be so hostile to religion?”&lt;br&gt;“Why does the Scientific Community mock us so?”&lt;br&gt;“Why can't we as religious believers get the respect that we seek?”&lt;br&gt;“Why can't science and religion join hands?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I, Science, reply to you that We are hostile to you because you claim to be of Our Number, but are not.&lt;br&gt;Your representatives – the creationists and apologists of the ID movement – claim allegiance to Science when your claim is invalid and a manipulation for your own advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are imposters, all of you, liars and imposters with an agenda.&lt;br&gt;You serve yourselves and your own interests, and not those of Science.&lt;br&gt;You seek to exalt your savior and your faith.&lt;br&gt;You don't seek Truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this I say to you – the religious intelligencia who actively seek an alliance with, Me, Science – take the liberties I give you. Bask in the sun of the life conveniences and the comforts I have granted to you, to worship, to sing, to pray, and to affirm or to deny any belief you want; teach and expound; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine; imagine and create, appoint and oversee; stand outside and admire the stars and the host of heaven as you believe your god provided them for you to admire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the raindrops bounce off of your tongue; admire to no end; teach on love, seek peace, and promote change as you see fit. Do all these things and My covenant of peace shall abide with you, and a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;very small&lt;/span&gt; number of My White-coated Representatives of Science shall at times join you as you worship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But should you cross into My Territory, into the Territory that belongs to Science, should you bring your antiquated holy books into My Realms of microscopes and peer-reviewed journals, should you take select quotes from real Scientists to bolster your own beliefs and the claims of your false scientists, I will attack you and will kill you in open debate.&lt;br&gt;You can never stand up to Me, oh religion.&lt;br&gt;I am your Successor.&lt;br&gt;I am your Better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should the outstretched arms and bleeding hands of your savior embolden you to embrace Our Naturalistic Approach and begin to choke our Scientific Method, should the representatives of your splintered, pious movements begin to interfere and impersonate Our Scientists, to subvert our Work and to make it your own work, a great trespass is committed, and I will remember no more the covenant I made with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nay, I, Science, shall strike you down, and your academics shall be cast out of the universities.&lt;br&gt;All My Scholars shall hiss at you, and you will be a mockery and an abhorrence to all of the Enlightened everywhere.&lt;br&gt;You shall grope in the darkness.&lt;br&gt;Only the simpleton and the ignoramus and the child shall hear you.&lt;br&gt;The dumb and the fool and the unlearned shall be they who give ear to your words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I, Science, shall surely slay you in the courts of the lands.&lt;br&gt;Cursed shall you be in the schools and cursed shall you be in the colleges.&lt;br&gt;Cursed shall you be in the laboratories and cursed shall you be in all of the institutions of higher learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I, Science, have spoken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(JH)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-7896150765358126256?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re welcome. I write honestly about our son and our life — if I put a rosy spin on it I think that would diminish all of us.  But I feel bad sometimes, like all I ever do is complain about Alex, complain about autism or its symptoms. I really can’t think how the neurodiversity crowd does it so acceptingly, so cheerfully. Embrace the differences, the spinning, stimming, screaming symptoms of autism, which sometimes wake you at 3 in the morning or force you to run full speed to catch your 11-year-old child before he’s too far away — and where he’ll continue to run until the distance between you is ungulfable, dangerous — and litter your floor and furniture with pretzel crumbs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:343px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/candy.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of D Sharon Pruitt" width="333" height="500"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of D Sharon Pruitt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a big spectrum. So sometimes I think that the people who say they don’t want to change or cure their children are people whose kids are perhaps a little easier to communicate with than our son. Or perhaps their lives are more settled, a bit easier. Our work lives are uncertain these days, and our futures are, too. So there’s pressure everywhere we look, which makes it a little harder to simply absorb a child who is different and unusual into our rich, happy, secure-job-filled lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d describe our life as varied and textured but stressed, worried and short on sleep, filled with great food and family and interesting city experiences, but a bit thin on social life. We bring Alex to a number of gatherings but it’s increasingly harder as he gets older and bigger. We wonder how long we’ll all live together in the same apartment; we wonder how long before he comes to fewer family events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think people who support neurodiversity are crazy or misguided — and I don’t want them to think that I am, either. If I can accept them, why can’t they accept me?&lt;/p&gt;

Sick and tired of politics after the 2004 election I decided to start a science-only blog - Circadiana.  After a couple of days of fiddling with the templae, on January 8, 2005, I posted the very first post, this one, at 2:53 AM and went to bed.  When I woke up I was astonished as the Sitemeter was &lt;a href="http://sciencepolitics.blogspot.com/2005/01/holy-cow.html" title=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;going wild!  This post was linked by BoingBoing and later that day, by Andrew Sullivan.  It has been linked by people ever since, as recently as a couple of days ago, although the post is a year and a half old.  Interestingly, it is not linked so much by science or medical bloggers, but much more by people who write about gizmos and gadgets or popular culture on LiveJournal, Xanga and MySpace, as well as people putting the link on their del.icio.us and stumbleupon lists.  In order to redirect traffic away from Circadiana and to here, I am reposting it today, under the fold.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The ad in question read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You can be good without God&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a &lt;a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/663948"&gt;recent Supreme Court decision&lt;/a&gt;, Metro Transit is now revising their policies.  Here’s &lt;strong&gt;Chris Hammond&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://atheistbus.ca/2009/07/10/atheist-ads-on-the-horizon-in-halifax/"&gt;Canadian Atheist Bus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is great news for free speech but also great news for our atheist ad. Metro transit informed us months ago that they would revise their policy on advertising what some may deem ‘controversial’,  if the courts ruled in favour of the Canadian Federation of Students. We are hopeful that Metro Transit will make good on their stated intentions and reconsider our proposed advertisements with as little additional delay as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The courts did rule in favor of the Canadian Federation of Students and the atheists will re-apply for a bus ad on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

She doesn&amp;#39;t like those atheists one bit — she&amp;#39;s got a list of 5 horrible facts about atheists (although it could be longer, if she hadn&amp;#39;t kindly left off the bits about baby-eating). &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being the hot topic of the day, any discussion of atheism, should include these 'difficult to admit' points:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Firstly, atheists claim that they themselves are god. They claim they have superior knowledge then the rest of us by trying to say that they have better knowledge because of their own thinking. They will not acknowledge anyone else to be above them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I only rank myself as a lesser demon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, atheists have been hurt somewhere in their lives, can't understand suffering, and are mad at God -- so it is easier to deny there is one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so confused. They&amp;#39;ve been hurt, so the can&amp;#39;t understand suffering…wouldn&amp;#39;t it make more sense to say they have &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; been hurt, so they can't understand suffering, or they have been hurt, so they &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; understand suffering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;ve suffered the usual losses throughout my life, but haven&amp;#39;t been inordinately afflicted — I&amp;#39;ve actually been fairly fortunate. Her premise fails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, atheists are looking for God for the same reason a thief would be looking for a police officer. They don't want to be accountable to a higher being because of the wrong things they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what wrong things do we do? Isn't it a bit much to assume all atheists are criminals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strangely, note that her first three items — atheists think they are god, they are mad at god, and they&amp;#39;re afraid of god — all assume the existence of a god. This is the one basic idea these cranks have to get in their heads: &lt;i&gt;atheists don't believe in gods&lt;/i&gt;, period. Plug that in and everything she has said so far is patent foolishness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, atheists forget that when a person goes to a museum and admires a painting, that there was a painter/designer of that art piece. The art piece is absolute evidence of a painter and not caused by random nothingness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All of the world, stars, animals, plants, oceans, and mountains are absolute proof of a divine intelligent being (beyond our human ability and thinking) who made these things.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Can the atheist make a tree? It is scientifically impossible for bees to fly (laws of physics) and yet they do. It is impossible for our eyes to see and yet they do. What more proof does an atheist need than their own heart pumping in their chest without them commanding their heart to pump each beat in perfect timing each and every second necessary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, good old argument from invalid analogy. I have a black cat. I have a second black cat. Therefore, all cats are black. Nancy shows me a gray cat. I could say my hypothesis is false, or I could close my eyes and say it's actually a black cat and stick by my hypothesis. Which makes more sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s doing the same thing. Here&amp;#39;s a painting, it has a designer. Here&amp;#39;s a sculpture, it has a designer. Therefore everything is designed. I show her a blade of grass…it evolved, and the individual blade grew from a seed, and no designer acted. But Nancy will simply close her eyes and declare that it was designed, anyway. Why is grass designed? Because paintings are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, uh, Nancy? Bees don't fly by miracle. They obey the laws of physics, none are violated. Same for vision: we know quite a bit about the physics and chemistry and biology of eyes, and there's no step where you can it's physically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifthly, denial is a strong coping mechanism in crisis, but does not serve anyone in the long run. Like an ostrich with its head in the sand, an atheist denies God not because God does not exist--but because the atheist doesn't want God to exist and does not want to see the truth and evidence in front of their eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I would rather believe in God and make sure my life is doing what is acceptable to this Superior Being than to not believe in God and find out I will be accountable to this God for everything I've done after I die. With 84% of the world's population believing in the existence of God, I think the majority rules in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little Pascal's wager to round out the list, followed by an argument from popularity. She's one big fallacy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cheerful atheist in Alberta has got to introduce themselves to Nancy, because clearly she's never met one before. You might give her a primer in logic, too, because she hasn't met that before, either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/a_lesson_in_atheist_philosophy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/8LgmN0zGsik" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247359082472"><id gr:original-id="http://yrif.org/?p=684">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/303b787ed0e11ab9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="devo"/><category term="judaism"/><title type="html">Q: Are we not Jews?

Safety---along with sensory processing and communication---was the third of "the top three areas people [on the autism spectrum who are now adults] wished they'd received help with as children" noted by parent and professional &lt;a href="http://www.chantalsicile-kira.com/"&gt;Chantal Sicile-Kira&lt;/a&gt; in her book &lt;a href="http://www.chantalsicile-kira.com/book3.html"&gt;Autism Life Skills: From Communication to Safety to Self-Esteem and More---10 Essential Abilities Every Child Needs and Deserves to Learn&lt;/a&gt;. A news story from the July 10th &lt;a href="http://www.peninsulaclarion.com/stories/071009/new_357677959.shtml"&gt;Peninsula Clarion&lt;/a&gt; reminds me of why safety may be the third area mentioned, but it's as important as the other two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.peninsulaclarion.com/stories/071009/new_357677959.shtml"&gt;Peninsula Clarion&lt;/a&gt; reports that a former church youth leader, 47-year-old Richard J. Wagner, has been sentenced to 13 years with 8 years suspended, plus three months hard jail time for sexually abusing a 12-year-old boy between November 2007 and April 2008, and for possession of child pornography. The boy is on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a person with autism, the boy "longed for a friend ... someone he could trust," said his mother in a statement to the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she and her husband would have preferred Wagner remain in jail for 10 years, at which time her son would have entered into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenai Superior Court Judge Carl Bauman also stated that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where you had a position of authority in the church, this comes in the classic definition of hypocrite."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all the more with a child "longing for a friend."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247354402830"><id gr:original-id="http://actionforautism.co.uk/?p=319">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/313883e4073b5a59</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">A better future for autistic adults</title><published>2009-07-11T19:08:23Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T19:08:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionforautism.co.uk/2009/07/11/a-better-future-for-autistic-adults/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Following on from the National Autistic Society’s I Exist campaign and the massive support for the Autism Bill in Parliament the UK Government, after working closely with an external reference group chaired by NAS chief executive, Mark Lever, has launched a

Case in point: &lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/kingdomofpriests/2009/07/hp-lovecraft-darwinisms-visionary-storyteller.html"&gt;David Klinghoffer&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re already familiar with him, you won&amp;#39;t be surprised at this. He&amp;#39;s written an essay in which he takes to task the concept of convergent evolution, as espoused by Ken Miller and Simon Conway Morris. I don&amp;#39;t care much for the way Miller and Conway Morris use the idea myself, but Klinghoffer&amp;#39;s argument…man. You&amp;#39;d think it was a parody if you didn&amp;#39;t know Klinghoffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His argument against convergence is that if it were true, then evolution could have led to something truly repulsive, like Cthulhu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Literally&lt;/i&gt; Cthulhu. He quotes a lot of H.P. Lovecraft, "Darwinism's visionary storyteller," and cites me linking to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/customize_your_bible.php"&gt;the "Unholy Bible"&lt;/a&gt;, and claims that &amp;quot;Darwinists love him&amp;quot;. Apparently, we aren&amp;#39;t just unbelievers, or even merely Satan-worshippers anymore — we&amp;#39;ve moved on to worshipping inimical alien beings beyond space and time that intend to remorselessly destroy us. Ken Miller (!) is naively promoting the adoration of monsters when he suggests that maybe his god wasn&amp;#39;t so specific in his mechanisms as to demand mammalian bipeds as the recipients of ensoulment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ken Miller hasn't publicly expressed any known fondness for Lovecraft, and I don't think his idea of evolution as a natural process undetectably adjusted by a benign deity would accommodate itself well to a Cthulhu-dominated universe. As for the rest of us, and me personally, H.P. Lovecraft's stories are clearly &lt;i&gt;fiction&lt;/i&gt;: we don't see them as a portrayal of our universe at all. I find them entertaining because the descriptions are so flamboyantly over the top, and because, well, &lt;i&gt;tentacles&lt;/i&gt;. There&amp;#39;s also the factor that, as an atheist, I find the similarities between a hostile anti-human monster and the Christian religion&amp;#39;s petty, cosmic tyrant amusing. Really, my shrine to the Elder Gods is very tiny, only taking up one of the smaller wings of my mansion. (Uh-oh, it&amp;#39;s Klinghoffer—he might think I mean that for real.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, if we rewound the tape of life and ran it forward again, and evolution led to intelligent cephalopods, an anthropocentric bigot like Klinghoffer might well regard them as &amp;quot;grotesque, obnoxious, loathsome, abhorrent, ghastly&amp;quot;, but I&amp;#39;d think them pretty cool…and most importantly, these beings would consider their own forms beautiful, and us strangely twisted chordates as hideous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way: nobody should tell him how &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/04/pharyngula_the_blog_that_bring.php"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; appears in some dusty corners of Cthulhu lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A world filled with wonder, a cold, fathomless sky&lt;br&gt;
A man’s life so meager, he can but wonder why&lt;br&gt;
He cries out to Heaven its truth to reveal&lt;br&gt;
The answer: only silence, for God isn’t real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go tell the executioner of the power he can’t defy&lt;br&gt;
Go tell his shackled victim of the mercy on high…&lt;br&gt;
Then go to your churches, go beg, pray, and kneel,&lt;br&gt;
But don’t ask me to follow, for God isn’t real.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mocking Bass.  For four years this fish watched me cast lures and live bait from the end of the small dilapidated dock in the lagoon behind the cabin, without ever showing interest in what I had to offer.  Two weeks ago I dropped a plastic worm on his head.  The worm slid off and rested on the bottom.  The mocking bass reoriented towards the worm and took a sniff.  I jiggled the worm.  And, BANG.  He took the bait.  My drag was set to medium, so WZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ .. he took off across the lagoon.  I tightened the drag a little because he was running into brush and he turned direction and jumped. But I kept the rod tip up and used his jump to bring him in.  He ran back and forth across the lagoon two more times and then headed out.  WZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ against the harder drag with his last bit of strength, and one more jump.   Then I brought him in, letting him struggle and tire a little more because they always manage to pull off that one last bit of resistance, the one where you lose most of the big ones.  I got on my knees and pulled him out just as he got near the dock... And that fish was THIS BIG!!!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/i_only_fish_for_the_fishing_no.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/i_only_fish_for_the_fishing_no.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/YbRqUFCkEnk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247339844296"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/book_review_unscientific_ameri.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/13ef52169d75541f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Book review"/><title type="html">Book review: Unscientific America.</title><published>2009-07-11T19:20:16Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T19:20:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/qi0PK6O14N8/book_review_unscientific_ameri.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/book_review_unscientific_ameri.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/upload/2009/07/UnscientificAmerica.jpg" width="350" height="532" alt="UnscientificAmerica.jpg"&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Basic Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book, Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum set out to alert us to a problem, and they gesture in the direction of a solution to that problem.  Despite the subtitle of the book, their target is not really scientific illiteracy -- they are not arguing that producing generations of Americans who can do better on tests of general scientific knowledge will fully address the problem that worries them.  Rather, the issue they want to tackle is the American public's broad disengagement with scientific knowledge and with the people and processes that build it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(Not so great is some of the horrific language the reporter used, but that's a topic for a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/press_terminology_and_disablism"&gt;different post&lt;/a&gt;.)  This article addresses some key topics in AAC-intersect-autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Fears that using AAC will prevent someone from speaking / communicating are unfounded; AAC is intended to facilitate communication and has at times been a bridge to speech.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Communication is not speech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Removing frustration that comes from speech, language, or movement difficulties improves both quality of life and behavior (because 1. one is not frustrated all the time, and 2. one does not need to resort to unpleasant behavior to get the message across).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Enabling communication, no matter what the form, radically changes how people will percieve an individual (so some care needs to be taken about assumptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Once the idea of speech is let go of, some far more exciting things may emerge,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...[AAC] also allows him to have meaningful exchanges with people. Family pictures have been downloaded to the device. Ask Kyle about his family, and he will pull up pictures of him with his mom, dad and sister. He will show you his home in Henderson. He will show you pictures of things he likes to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the DynaVox, Kyle's personality has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He's more animated," Merrihew said. "He likes to be silly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He's really funny," Bailey added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every day we learn something we didn't know he knew," Bailey said. "We're just trying to get it out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Even for those of us who have some speech, we may not always be able to use it to communicate; further, some of us may need AAC in order to initiate conversation or "find" words.  This is &lt;em&gt;OK&lt;/em&gt;, because not only is commuincation not speech but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Communication is &lt;em&gt;more important than&lt;/em&gt; speech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This are all key points I hit in every presentation I give on AAC, whether it's for educators, support staff, or scientists and policy makers.  But what makes the Nebraska story so much cooler than my usual writing is that it doesn't state these points in a general, bulleted list or with the dryness of a formal presentation, but with vibrant personal stories.  &lt;a href="http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2009/07/09/living/402/doc4a551d197da1e267780038.txt"&gt;DynaVox device provides a voice for area boys with autism&lt;/a&gt; has made bookmark -and-share-repeatedly status. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ask Michelle Obama to Meet With Autism Families &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We, the undersigned, propose that Michelle Obama meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers, representatives of the autism community, to discuss effective strategies to provide urgently needed assistance to overstressed autism families.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We believe that an Autism Corps, based on the Teach for America model, can create an army of trained volunteers to effect this assistance by providing four to fourteen weekly hours of one-to-one in-home support for people with autism.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We believe autism families&amp;#39; immediate need for day-to-day assistance with their autistic family members supersedes discussion of ongoing autism research and causation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

We believe in supporting measures that benefit all autism families.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;: Those who believe in providing support for ALL families affected by autism.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt; (Preamble):
We would like to propose that Michelle Obama meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers, two parents representing two very different autism families&amp;#39; perspectives, to discuss creating an Autism Corps or other measure that will address one of the most pressing needs of families affected by autism: one-to-one in-home support.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thousands of American children and adults have autism diagnoses, and their ranks are swelling. While autism shouldn&amp;#39;t be demonized, we need to be frank: having a child with autism is more stress than some families can handle. There often aren&amp;#39;t enough trained professionals providing autism services -- and in areas where autism professionals are abundant, many families can&amp;#39;t afford their services. Those families have needs that take precedence over panels and promises and research; they need help getting through the day, and they need it now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Michelle and Barack Obama have spearheaded a campaign to encourage service. Millions of energetic and idealistic young adults want work but can&amp;#39;t find jobs. Our president has said that he &amp;quot;...believes we must work to guarantee that Americans with ASD [autism spectrum disorder] can live independent and fully productive lives and to assure that their families understand and are able to support a loved one with ASD.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We would like to discuss taking those three factors and combining them into a nationwide organization dedicated to training volunteers to aid kids and adults with autism: an Autism Corps, based on the Teach For America urgent action model, to provide autism families in need with between four and fourteen hours of weekly care.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Autism Corps workers could be trained to help individuals with autism gain skills and independence, and have recreation opportunities. They could give their families some sorely-needed respite. They could make a real difference for families approaching a breaking point. And, like Teach for America alumni, Autism Corps volunteers would have a permanent interest and investment in autism rights and issues, thereby continuing to raise awareness of autism needs in general.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We believe that an Autism Corps model is the best way to support all families affected by autism. If you agree, and you think Michelle Obama should meet with Shannon Des Roches Rosa and Jennifer Byde Myers to discuss the matter, then please sign our petition. Thank you.
&lt;/p&gt;

If you are at TAM, please step up and say hello. That’s me in the picture at left. I despise name tags, but I suppose I will have to conform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not at TAM, you have to ask yourself …..why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will assume that you are far far away on some distant continent(or planet) or cannot make it due to the dire state of the economy or some other circumstances beyond your control. I understand. But in lieu of a new post by me and you having nothing better to do to satisfy your every skeptical need in my absence; please read or re-read my past rants on &lt;strong&gt;“Guerrilla Skepticism,”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“Ambush Skepticism”&lt;/strong&gt;and take a few minutes to consider what you might do for The Skeptologists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there any millionaire dilettante you know who needs a cause to write off as a tax break or use to gain a social advantage by supporting? Do you personally know Trump, Gates …or even Rupert Murdock? Are you anywhere near that sixth degree of separation to Al Gore or Anderson Cooper? Can you get Mike Judge or even Rob Zombie on board this project? Instead of working  fretfully at your work desk or computer cubicle and making The Boss richer, would you use that spare time you usually use surfing the vastness of the Internet to connect The Skeptologists up with a media sponsor or better still;…&lt;em&gt;a network executive? &lt;/em&gt;How difficult can it be to get a few hours of science and sanity sandwiched in between &lt;em&gt;“American Idol”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“One Tree Hill?”&lt;/em&gt; ?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Is there anyone out there willing to make the leap to the next big event in reality television – and I mean &lt;strong&gt;REALITY&lt;/strong&gt; television, not just another season of Ice Truckers? Ponderous questions indeed. We need your support now more than ever. Show your colors. Think Big and help get us the space up on the marque you know we deserve! I’m counting on YOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;A full detailed report of my investigations will follow on my return.&lt;/p&gt;

And they're not even being subtle about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/assets/pdf/D213815778.DOC"&gt;draft resolution&lt;/a&gt; reads like typically uninformed religious propaganda. It starts off requiring that staff and students be granted rights they already have: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;School will not discriminate against private religious expression.&lt;br&gt;School will educate about, not indoctrinate religious faith.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;*headdesk*&lt;br&gt;Students have &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; had the right to &lt;i&gt;private&lt;/i&gt; religious expression. It's when they start doing it publicly, in a manner that disrupts the curriculum or the academic environment that it becomes unacceptable.&lt;br&gt;Schools have &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; had the ability to teach &lt;i&gt;about&lt;/i&gt; religion. This is something the religious right frequently whines about because to teach about it, means we don't leave out the things they'd rather not have people know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it doesn't get any better.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Promote dialogue between schools and community concerning faith.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yes. Invite sectarian groups to proselytize. Smart one there. And who gets to pick &lt;i&gt;which&lt;/i&gt; groups are invited in to do this?&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Create a climate of academic freedom concerning faith issues.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This idea sounds wonderful, but how fairly will it be applied? I remember a few years ago a similar notion of allowing religious groups to distribute “backpack mail”. But as soon as a Pagan group wanted to use it, &lt;a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Va.+Pagans+advertise+through+Falwell-secured+school+%27backpack+mail%27-a0159504803"&gt;it drew complaints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Allow for student and employee religious expression within the law.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I feel pretty repetitive here, but students &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have this right. Teachers, not so much. If the “within the law” statement is actually upheld, then this resolution doesn't actually mean anything.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;School will neither promote, or disparage religious faith.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Which isn't never been allowed to in the first place! Why is this crap included in here? I think it's pretty obvious: A critical analysis of these people's religions and the history of their religion doesn't necessary cast it in a positive light. That's not disparaging it. It's being honest about it. But such people are so thin skinned that they can't tell the difference anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next section is “Definition”. The one for religion is stupidly vague:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Religion-a specific system of belief which may or may not include a deity, is not limited to orthodox belief systems or practices.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh look! Words to equivocate with! Let's not define the difference between “belief” based on evidence and “belief” based on blind faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next one is even worse:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Evolution – The belief that an unguided process of mutation and natural selection resulted in the existence of life on earth.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I can &lt;i&gt;guarantee&lt;/i&gt; no one with any scientific knowledge beyond a basic course helped write this crap. Evolution is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; unguided. Natural selection is a powerful guiding force. Evolution does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; have anything to do with the “existence of life on earth”. It only discusses the &lt;i&gt;diversity&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The section on “Graduation exercises and other Extra-Curricular Activities” is nothing but things that have been ruled against by courts in the past:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;a. Content of speeches by private individuals will not regulated on religious content.&lt;br&gt;b. School will permit the graduating class to choose whether to have an invocation and or benediction to be given by student volunteer in a non-proselytizing and nonsectarian manner.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first one is basically saying that the school will not keep out preaching. The second contradicts the first saying that proselytizing is not ok. Make up your minds guys. It even contradicts itself by allowing for a “nonsectarian benediction”. While a benediction &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be just a general well-wishing, given the title of the document (&lt;i&gt;Religious&lt;/i&gt; Liberty), it's safe to assume that it's talking about a religious one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the school I mentioned before, this school is trying to allow for distribution of religious materials too:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;a. Religious materials may not be singled out for specific regulation based on content.&lt;br&gt;b. Students may distribute religious materials at reasonable times and manners designated by the school.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Again, something that sounds good, but just wait till someone with views they &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want tries to apply for the same rights. As for the second statement, students already have these rights, but it's pretty worthless anyway. Unless you want trashcans full of Chick tracts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The section on “Religion in the Curriculum” is just a mess.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;1. Curriculum areas that overlap religious faith shall demonstrate respect for affected religious convictions.&lt;br&gt;2. Electives to be offered at Spencer High School:&lt;br&gt;  a. The Bible in History and Literature&lt;br&gt;  b. Critic of Darwinism, a scientific approach.  (provide a balanced review of evidence for and against the theory of evolution, using texts which include “Darwin’s Black Box” by M. Behe)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The idea that topics that may overlap must “demonstrate respect” is just code for “tiptoe around anything we don't like to hear” which destroys the stance of neutrality they're pretending to create. As far as the elective courses, the first one is fine. The second is, well, at least they're admitting the “criticism” of religion is a &lt;i&gt;religious&lt;/i&gt; exercise. But seriously, &lt;i&gt;Darwin's Black Box&lt;/i&gt;!? That book's been torn up and down so many times now it's not even funny. That's hardly “balanced”. Nor does “Darwinism” even exist beyond a silly Creationist strawman!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And just so the whole thing ends on a stupid note: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;Teaching about the holidays.   Discussion of the significance in an objective and historical nature will be allowed.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sure. So they're going to admit that every Christian holiday is a rip off of other religions? Yep. Thought that one through real well...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;HT: &lt;a href="http://www.stupidevilbastard.com/"&gt;Stupid Evil Bastard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-2976703015969895926?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247332675207"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/collins_gets_panned_almost_eve.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2667402ac689ad23</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Collins gets panned almost everywhere</title><published>2009-07-11T17:57:11Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T17:57:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Cf9b82d_ylM/collins_gets_panned_almost_eve.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/collins_gets_panned_almost_eve.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been wrestling with how to respond to the imminent appointment of Francis Collins to the NIH, and it&amp;#39;s tough. The problem is that he has excellent qualifications for the position of chief paper-pusher and technician-wrangler, but that his position on religion is just plain weird. He&amp;#39;s a lovable dufus with great organizational skills whose grasp of the principles of science is superficial. But you can&amp;#39;t just reject the guy because he&amp;#39;s religious — we&amp;#39;re in big trouble when we start using a religious litmus test for high political positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait…we already do that. You know if someone with equivalent prestige and administrative credentials was even half as vocal about atheism as Collins is about Christianity, there&amp;#39;s no way she would even be considered for this appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was on &lt;a href="http://www.am770chqr.com/Station/Podcasts.aspx"&gt;The World Tonight Redux with Rob Breakenridge&lt;/a&gt;, a radio program out of Canada to talk about these issues the other night, and I listed a few reasons why Collins was a poor choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a big-science guy, who headed the National Human Genome Research Institute. I have some concern that he has a mindset that may not promote the diversity of scientific research — he represents a very narrow, gene-jockey style of research, which is valuable and does churn out lots of data, but I&amp;#39;ve often found exhibits a worrisome lack of understanding of the big picture of biology. I&amp;#39;d have liked to have seen a leader with more breadth: someone with an appreciation of systems biology, or environmental biology, and a little less shackled to the purely biomedical side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doesn't understand evolution. He has said that he thinks humans are no longer evolving, that junk DNA is functional, and he can't understand how altruism could have evolved. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/evolgen/2008/01/francis_collins_should_not_be.php"&gt;RPM summarized these deficiencies well&lt;/a&gt;. I know he argues well against the specifics of intelligent design, but ultimately, he's following the same gods-of-the-gaps formula that the Discovery Institute does, as this &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2222562/"&gt;article on Slate&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This formula offers a convenient litmus test for where Collins falls on a variety of questions: If a given problem appears to be merely unsolved, then he'll leave it to the realm of science; if, on the other hand, Collins deems a question to be unsolvable, it's fair game for inclusion in a spiritual interpretation of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not what I want to hear from someone with such a visible position in science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His website, &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/"&gt;Biologos&lt;/a&gt;, is an embarrassment of poor reasoning and silly christian apologetics. It's &lt;i&gt;awful&lt;/i&gt;. His logic is a joke, and all it really shows is that Collins is a man blinded by faith to the absurdities of his convictions. That he even &lt;i&gt;asks&lt;/i&gt;  "At what point in the evolutionary process did humans attain the 'Image of God'?", or "Was there death before the Fall?", among many other similar absurdities, is a revelation. These are questions that don't even have any meaning outside the scope of a specific, very narrow religious view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also another difficult issue for me. I&amp;#39;m the last guy who&amp;#39;s going to say someone should be denied a position because he maintains a controversial website. However, it&amp;#39;s not the controversy that annoys me (it&amp;#39;s also not particularly controversial among the American mainstream — it&amp;#39;s more like a site that panders to a religious bias), it&amp;#39;s the stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a big one for me: he will use his position to act as a propagandist for Christianity, entirely inappropriately. We already saw this in the announcement of the completion of the draft of the human genome project, where he actually &lt;i&gt;brags&lt;/i&gt; about getting Clinton to include religious language in his speech, and where he himself made claims about the DNA sequence being "the language of god". The head of the NIH isn't just an administrative position; it's a &lt;i&gt;political&lt;/i&gt; position, and the appointment of a loudly evangelical Christian to that spot is sending a political message. There are enough of us even louder atheists out here who will make a stink over any attempt on his part to use the accomplishments of science under the NIH to proselytize, that he's going to have to be very cautious in his statements from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, my objections rest on an important word: integrity. Collins hasn't got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't mean integrity in the sense of being honest and having strong moral principles; I think Collins is entirely sincere, and he doesn't seem to be the type to have ever crossed any lines of ethical behavior, except perhaps in his taste in music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean integrity as in the condition of being unified, unimpaired, or sound in construction. He's a jumble of intellectual contradictions, and when you read any of his &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,4047,God-vs-Science---A-debate-between-Richard-Dawkins-and-Francis-Collins,TIME-Magazine"&gt;interviews&lt;/a&gt;, he comes off as an amiable lightweight. I'd rather have someone who can &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; like a scientist in charge than yet another Jebusite with an evangelical agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/primatediaries/2009/07/sam_harris_francis_collins_and.php"&gt;Eric Michael Johnson&lt;/a&gt; all have interesting things to say on this subject. I have no hope that any of this will make a difference, however; Collins will obligingly appeal to the superstitions of congress and sail through any confirmation. I had higher hopes for Obama, but at this point, I can only despair of the kind of president who would &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090710/ap_on_re_eu/eu_obama_vatican"&gt;consult the Pope on bioethics&lt;/a&gt;. I'm beginning to feel he will not hesitate to sacrifice reason on the altar of religious conformity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/collins_gets_panned_almost_eve.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Cf9b82d_ylM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247331849975"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/which_is_more_agile_cats_or_do.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa775c707d5780b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Which is more agile:  Cats or dogs?</title><published>2009-07-11T17:11:05Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T17:11:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/3YRqTuT03Rw/which_is_more_agile_cats_or_do.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/which_is_more_agile_cats_or_do.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dogs:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correct answer is… &lt;strong&gt;Rob Sherman&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Michael Newdow&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how I know that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/godless-in-chicago/2009/07/newdow-sherman-to-sue-to-block-onug-at-capitol-visitor-center.html"&gt;Rob Sherman said so&lt;/a&gt;.  (Modest one, no? &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt;  ) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two guys are suing over the &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/12/god-to-be-engraved-in-visitor-center/"&gt;Capitol Visitor Center fiasco&lt;/a&gt; (they’re engraving “In God We Trust” and the Pledge of Allegiance with “Under God” into the CVC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they’re right in theory, this lawsuit won’t work for the same reason “In God We Trust” is still on our money: It’s considered our national motto and not a promotion of religion.  There’s a reason no major atheist (or church-state) organization is taking up this case — if you’re not going to win, you don’t want to waste resources.  And a losing lawsuit just sets further precedent and hurts us in the future when we may actually have a solid case in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, Newdow and Sherman know this.  They’re both lawyers.  It sounds like they’re more concerned with getting their names in the news than being realistic about this case.&lt;br&gt;

To kick it off, here's a song that almost everyone knows of, by the Eagles.  Only, the Eagles didn't write it.  Jackson Browne was screwing around in his flat with this song that "wasn't quite done" according to him.  He played it for Glen Frey, and was stumped after the line "standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona, such a fine sight to see."  The Eagles' contribution to the song was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a girl, my lord,
&lt;br&gt;in a flatbed Ford
&lt;br&gt;slowin' down to have a look at me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That's right; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of/19%20Take%20it%20Easy%201.mp3"&gt;Take it Easy&lt;/a&gt; is a Jackson Browne song.  (And, incidentally, Winslow, Arizona was chosen because it's the worst place they could imagine being stuck.  Perhaps not knowing this, Winslow &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TakeItEasy_WinslowAZ.jpg"&gt;erected a statue&lt;/a&gt; commemorating this song.)  This is his version, and -- although I &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; the Eagles -- Jackson Browne's version is far superior to me.  Hope you enjoy the listen, too!  (Note: the player I use is down, so you can &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of/19%20Take%20it%20Easy%201.mp3"&gt;click here to listen&lt;/a&gt; if the embedding is broken.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.odeo.com/flash/audio_player_standard_gray.swf&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=52&amp;amp;flashVars=valid_sample_rate%3Dtrue%26external_url%3Dhttp://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of/19%2520Take%2520it%2520Easy%25201.mp3" width="500" height="52"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do to amuse yourself while you're listening?  Take a look at this optical illusion (and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of/Optical_Illusion_2.jpg"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for the full-size version):
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of/Optical_Illusion_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of/Optical_Illusion_2.jpg" width="512" alt="Optical_Illusion_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that whatever circle you look at stays stationary, but the ones in your periphery seem to rotate!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your peripheral vision, whose drawbacks can be seen via this illusion, is actually &lt;b&gt;superior&lt;/b&gt; for visual astronomy than your normal sight.  Seriously!  The next time you've got a clear night and you're staring at the sky:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of/palm-trees-stars-746499-ga.jpg" width="500" alt="palm-trees-stars-746499-ga.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for the dimmest star that's still visible to you.  Look at it in your peripheral vision.  (In other words, look about 5-10 degrees away from the star, but be aware of where it is out of the corner of your eye.)  It becomes &lt;i&gt;easier&lt;/i&gt; to see in your periphery.  Now look directly at it; you might see it disappear!  This happens to me a lot more easily than my wife (who has perfect vision, and I don't), but it &lt;i&gt;ought to&lt;/i&gt; happen to everyone.  Take a look the next time you have the opportunity; this is one more neat thing your body can do!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/weekend_diversion_the_power_of.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247328162259"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8100">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b178c5cad167dc0c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><category term="love"/><title type="html">Congrats Becca and Sid</title><published>2009-07-11T15:51:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T15:51:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8100" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=04d48b3bb90a23da3a8368762d26a8f7&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it–&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/"&gt;Rebecca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skeptic.org.uk/news/"&gt;Sid&lt;/a&gt; got married at &lt;a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/jref-office"&gt;TAM&lt;/a&gt;.  So bummed I couldn’t be there, but so happy I could see it on JREFmedia stream!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris pointed out &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/04/09/why-reason-loses-special-marc-morano-edition/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that climate change denier extraordinaire Marc Morano may be dead wrong, but he’s articulate, well funded, and there’s no one on the science side that competes with him. What specifically can be done to change that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s simple: Things won’t change until the world of science invests in creating counter-Moranos. There are many talented and extremely young intelligent people in science today who could fill that role, but there is little training available for them, and even less of a career trajectory for them to get there.&lt;/p&gt;

We definitely have our differences, or different emphases, but I hope our argument ended up being enlightening, rather than demolishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big difference was over high school science education. I just can’t see any long-term solution that is superior to doing a better job of teaching high school kids about science and getting them to feel that it’s part of their lives. Part of this involves getting really good teachers out into all schools, not just the ones surrounded by McMansions. Part of this involves a program like the one I mentioned in the bloggingheads talk, called &lt;a href="http://www.usfirst.org/"&gt;FIRST&lt;/a&gt;, which was developed by Dean Kamen as a kind of robot-building Superbowl. And guess what? Kamen actually fills football stadiums with kids, and those kids are more likely to do better in school, get into science and engineering, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I don’t buy the counter-argument that there are lots of people with advanced degrees who don’t believe in vaccines, etc., and so “just more science education” won’t matter much. Let’s really unpack what we mean by “advanced degrees,” really. I know plenty of people who went to top colleges, and then on to top law schools or got higher degrees in literature or such–and the last time they took a real science class was in high school. It’s not as if the science seeped through the walls of the chemistry or biology departments and infused them while they were listening to lectures about Derrida or modern politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now–if I could just find that $50 billion I had set aside for improving high school science education…I know it’s around here somewhere…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris will be coming to my neck of the woods (New Haven) on Tuesday, July 21, to give a talk. I’ll be introducing him.&lt;a href="http://www.unscientificamerica.com/tour.php"&gt; Details here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This column is a great idea. Thanks for taking it on.&lt;br&gt;
The question is: am I missing something here? Am I ignoring some blind spot of my own? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem: I am both an atheist and  a practicing Zen Buddhist. While it is true that &lt;em&gt;some forms&lt;/em&gt; of Buddhism assert the existence of gods, demons and so forth—and no form of Buddhism explicitly &lt;em&gt;denies&lt;/em&gt; the existence of any such—these woo-woo characteristics spring from the cultures in which those particular forms of Buddhism grew up, rather than from anything in Buddhist philosophy itself. The group to which I belong—a stripped-down American version of Korean Zen—is completely non-theistic. The main practice is meditation, and there is no supernatural component to any of it. I derive—or &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; I derive—tremendous psychological benefit from the practice, and have found it very useful in examining the underlying causes of unhealthy actions and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet periodically I hear non-theists denigrate Buddhism with exactly the same language they reserve for fundies and born-agains. I think this stems from the erroneous notion (propagated by fundies and born-agains and repeated unwittingly by the uninformed) that the Buddha is some kind of god (he is not), that Buddhists pray to Buddha the way Christians pray to Jesus (they do not), and that karma is some kind of cosmic bank account where one stores up brownie points for future rebirths (it is not). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that Buddhism is probably the world’s oldest humanist “religion.” The most important guiding principle for practice, supposedly articulated by the Buddha himself 2,500 years ago, is simply, “try this out—see if it works; if not, abandon it.”  There is no element of faith in unseen forces, or acceptance of any tenet without evidence. Yet many of my fellow non-theists persist in their disparagement of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you say? Do you think I’m just fooling myself? Or am I merely the unfortunate victim of other people’s ignorance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Codswallop—The Perfect Fool
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Codswallop,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago, I practiced Zen Buddhism for many years as a lay member of an urban Zen center.  As in yours, the emphasis was on meditation, and basically any of those other beliefs were optional, being whatever each individual wanted to adopt or discard.  There were some very down-to-earth folks there, and some space cadets as well.   Whatever woo-woo that I subscribed to and eventually rejected was only the woo-woo that I had brought with me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every religion, even in very regulated sects, we see variation in what people focus on as essential and what they de-emphasize, disregard or dismiss as unessential.  Each individual, though they may not admit it, does at least some “customizing” of their belief system, so that it better fits their personality.  This is why there are thousands of sub-sects and sub-sub-sects.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path you are walking is of your own creation and definition.  You carry with you whatever baggage works for you, and as you journey, you may pick up a few new items, but probably you will discard more than you collect.  Gautama taught that we each have a buddha, a person who is &lt;em&gt;awake&lt;/em&gt; inside of us.  More than inside,  &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; us.   So your Buddhism is based on your buddha, not on somebody else’s.  You are the world’s leading authority on Codswallopism.  If keeping your mind free of clutter is what you want to do, then just keep right on sweeping clutter away whenever it begins to collect. You sound like you’ve become quite good at that.  The clutter in others’ minds is not your concern.  They have their own paths on which to walk or stumble as they choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose you are reviewing a paper. Also assume, that like most papers these days, that it has multiple authors, each of whom applies his expertise to the problem at hand. And finally, assume that you are an expert in some, but not all of the fields used to solve the particular problem being reported in this paper.

&lt;p&gt;What do you do if one of the key points in the paper that is not your area of expertise seems fishy. For example, if the paper is on your field area, what if some of the lab results seem fishy. Or if you are an analyst, what if the experimental setup seems odd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that you are a successful researcher, you probably have long-time collaborators who are experts in these fields. So, what is the best way of accessing their expertise, given that some sort of confidence generally surrounds papers in review.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's break down some of the relevant interests at work here:&lt;br&gt;

Isn't the internet a wonderful thing?&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I dare say no one has called out more to God than I for answers, even for answers about his own existence. No one has pleaded more with God for help. No one has been on their knees more than me. But I’ve heard nothing. Not one thing but my own voice, until eventually I got the impression that my prayers were merely floating to the ceiling and falling back down like stillborn stars. So, I got off my knees and determined, like the human that I am, to find the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have, indeed, for centuries, received nothing at all but silence from the God of the Old Testament, just as we have received no recent word from Jesus or Zeus or Apollo or Allah or Osiris. Thousands of years have passed and not an utterance. Does that not strike anyone else as peculiar?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did not set out at the start to disprove anything. I set out to find the truth. And these truths we can’t escape: Earth is billions of years old, Earth exists on a spiral arm of our galaxy, an insignificant spot, and not the center of the galaxy as many of our forebearers thought (which, by the way, gave creedance to the argument that we are the special planet, and a special species, in all of creation). The Earth will one day be uninhabited by people once again, not by a rapture, but either by a wayward asteroid or gamma ray burst or by the sun losing power. The truth is the canonical Bible contains many irreparable self-contradictions; condones slavery, mass slaughter, rape, the mutilation or altering of children’s genitalia, among other things; and cannot even get the details straight about the events surrounding Jesus’ death and resurrection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And at some point, all us of have to make a similar choice: Do we want to be complacent in living our lives for a faith that may or may not, in reality, be true, or can we mentally and emotionally handle another possibility: that we are an insignificant dot in a vast, vast universe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me, the option that we are an insignificant dot in a vast universe, takes much more wherewithall, and frankly, is a quite liberating axiom, to know that we are, at the core, connected and interconnected with the universe, not just Earth, and everything the universe is quite a beautiful thing, as astrophycisist Neil deGrasse Tyson noted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;His name is &lt;a href="http://www.jeremystyron.com/?p=1020"&gt;Jeremy Styron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-3438677895687514379?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Sensory overload and difficulties with communication: These are the two main sources of major anxiety  in individuals on the spectrum that I've heard mention of again and again from many people I've been in touch with. And they are the two things that Jim and I keep returning to when Charlie's gotten upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's only been in the past year plus that we've really noted Charlie's extreme sound sensitivity. It's not only loud sounds that bother him, but high-pitched ones, no matter how soft. (He even puts his hands over his ears when he's sleeping if there's a noise.) When he was younger, there was a time when he'd sniff his food before eating it, and when he licked the salt of the potato chips before eating them. (I only figured out what he was doing with the latter because one of his ABA therapists said she used to do the same thing.) He definitely is alert to textures and likes his clothes to be light and loose and soft and not too bulky. (Wool sweaters? &lt;i&gt;fuhgeddaboudit&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to shake my head when I find myself making a big deal about Charlie's sensory sensitivities as unusual responses to sensory stimuli were the one thing that Jim and I were quite sure that Charlie, when newly diagnosed, did not have. In those days, as now, Charlie's communication disability was a major concern; Charlie's initial diagnosis from the St Paul Public School District was, indeed, that he had a "communication disability" (I think they gave him that in part because I was so distressed about the whole situation; as you can see, things have been changed quite a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been reading (thanks very much to &lt;a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/site/AutismSpectrumDisorders"&gt;Bonnie&lt;/a&gt;) a book called &lt;a href="http://www.chantalsicile-kira.com/book3.html"&gt;Autism Life Skills: From Communication to Safety to Self-Esteem and More---10 Essential Abilities Every Child Needs and Deserves to Learn&lt;/a&gt; by parent and professional &lt;a href="http://www.chantalsicile-kira.com/"&gt;Chantal Sicile-Kira&lt;/a&gt;. It's sensory processing, communication, and safety that Sicile-Kira notes are "the top three areas people [on the autism spectrum who are now adults] wished they'd received help with as children" in the book's introduction (p. xxii). The first chapter, "Sensory Processing: Making Sense of the World," encourages parents to keep their child's sensory issues in mind when addressing behavior problems and even when undertaking a &lt;a href="http://www.wrightslaw.com/info/discipl.fab.starin.htm"&gt;Functional Behavior Analysis&lt;/a&gt; (p. 12). And Sicile-Kira also notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...behavior &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; communication, but we [non-autistic individuals] are not always so good on picking up what the message is. (p. 5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet more reasons why life with Charlie means thinking differently, and taking things at a different, often &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/life_in_the_slow_lane"&gt;slower pace&lt;/a&gt; and learning to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/pulling_with_control"&gt;pull carefully rather than push&lt;/a&gt;. As I've noted, Jim and I are &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/a_little_talk_and_a_lot_of_pictures"&gt;quite the big talkers&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of being Charlie's parents and advocates has meant learning that what he does---his behavior---can tell us quite a bit about what he's thinking and trying to communicate to us. It also suggests why &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_arent_all_theyre_cracked_up_to_be"&gt;words aren't all they're cracked up to be&lt;/a&gt;, and why &lt;em&gt;we've&lt;/em&gt; learned to use &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; other senses, in the hope of making better sense of things for Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the different segments of the conversation, and we actually had some significant disagreements about the role of education in solving our problem, and other matters. I think it was a great talk:&lt;/p&gt;

As a recent example, consider Margaret Carlson's analysis of Sarah Palin's resignation speech (from &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677#31838044"&gt;Countdown on July 9, 2009&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Sarah Palin is very good at stringing words together&lt;br&gt;
that don't have a subject, a verb and an object, they're just&lt;br&gt;
present participles and prepositions and "I love the people of Alaska"&lt;br&gt;
and "I'm quitting so I can serve them better".&lt;br&gt;
It makes no sense! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that Carlson means to claim that Palin speaks in fragments rather than complete sentences. But having "a subject, a verb and an object" is a poor diagnostic for this: for example, the very sentence that Carlson uses to make the claim appears to fail the test. And I don't believe it's true, by any test, that Palin's resignation statement contained an unusual number of sentence fragments, or was particularly rich in present participles and prepositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to count (fragments, present participles, and prepositions) in the &lt;a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/2009/07/full-text-of-palins-resignation-speech.php"&gt;transcript of Gov. Palin's statement&lt;/a&gt;, and compare their frequency with what you find in Ms. Carlson's commentaries (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glr4N_QWixQ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well as the episode linked above). I don't have the time to do it myself, today. But as a suggestion of what you're likely to find, here are their respective openings in the passages under discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;OK, good.&lt;br&gt;
Appreciate you all being here, and I just want to say hi to Alaska.&lt;br&gt;
I appreciate speaking directly to the people that I serve as governor&lt;br&gt;
and I thank you all for coming here today, on the shores of Lake Lucille –&lt;br&gt;
this is a source of inspiration for my family and for me –&lt;br&gt;
and I'm thankful that Todd flew in last night&lt;br&gt;
from commercial fishing grounds in Bristol Bay, to&lt;br&gt;
stand by my side&lt;br&gt;
as always.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well in- in the statement, in her back yard,&lt;br&gt;
there- the- the- I'm surprised you found,&lt;br&gt;
you know, the heart of it, which uh was&lt;br&gt;
the- the- the legal fees. Because there was the lame duck,&lt;br&gt;
she doesn't want to milk it, she doesn't want to go on junkets,&lt;br&gt;
everybody does it, remember there're countless others,&lt;br&gt;
who've quit, and when there're only two governors who've ever quit,&lt;br&gt;
under pressure,&lt;br&gt;
Eliot Spitzer and Jim McGreevy of- of New Jersey,&lt;br&gt;
uh but you found this one,&lt;br&gt;
and this one then turns out not to be right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, there are legitimate questions about the logical and rhetorical coherence of Gov. Palin's statement. But Ms. Carlson's apparent attempt to characterize this as syntactic incoherence was analytically lazy and linguistically silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[For a different take on the psycho-political correlates of sentence structure, see "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001514.html"&gt;Decisiveness is SVO: a Hitlerian theory of communication?&lt;/a&gt;", 9/30/2004; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001529.html"&gt;Decisiveness and clause structure&lt;/a&gt;", 10/6/2004.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 7/12/2009: fev at &lt;em&gt;Headsup: The Blog&lt;/em&gt; considers a range of recent cases where "the commenting class uses linguistic features of political speech to shed light on True Motives and Meaning", and observes ("&lt;a href="http://headsuptheblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/unseen-hand-club.html"&gt;Unseen Hand Club&lt;/a&gt;", 7/11/2009) that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very well organized assertions about personal and political character, and they fit neatly into a consistent pattern. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Incoherent metaphor? Hardly. I think we&amp;#39;re seeing a carefully arranged meta-frame emerge — the sort of metaphor by which a certain part of the population lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The First Step to Expertise

&lt;a href="http://www.aft.org/pubs-reports/american_educator/winter2002/CogSci.html" title="AFT: Publications: American Educator: Winter 2002: Ask the Cognitive Scientist"&gt;AFT: Publications: American Educator: Winter 2002: Ask the Cognitive Scientist&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Does This Suggest for Teachers?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Use examples: The fact that students seem to get stuck on examples does not mean that teachers should refrain from providing examples. Certainly, examples help students understand the abstract concepts and some researchers (e.g., Gick &amp;amp; Holyoak, 1983; Gentner et al., 1993) believe that by providing multiple examples, one encourages students to compare the examples and to thereby consider what they have in common; what they have in common, of course, is the deep structure we would like students to learn. Thus, it is probably helpful to tell them not just about Pavlov’s dog, but about a number of wide-ranging examples.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Make a distinction between rote and inflexible knowledge: This might be the most important point. &lt;strong&gt;Rote knowledge is meaningless. But inflexible knowledge is a natural consequence of learning.&lt;/strong&gt; We should neither despair when it appears, nor take drastic measures to eliminate it when its elimination could cause collateral damage to our students (i.e., diminished factual knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3. Appreciate the importance of students’ growing knowledge, even if it’s inflexible: Don’t be reluctant to build students’ factual knowledge base. Some facts end up in memory without any meaning, and other facts have meanings that are quite inflexible, but that doesn’t mean that teachers should minimize the teaching of facts in the curriculum. &amp;quot;Fact&amp;quot; is not synonymous with rote knowledge or with inflexible knowledge. &lt;strong&gt;Knowing more facts makes many cognitive functions (e.g., comprehension, problem solving) operate more efficiently.&lt;/strong&gt; If we minimize the learning of facts out of fear that they will be absorbed as rote knowledge, we are truly throwing the baby out with the bath water.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Remember that inflexible knowledge is a natural step on the way to the deeper knowledge that we want our students to have: Frustration that students’ knowledge is inflexible is a bit like frustration that a child can add but can’t do long division. It’s not that this child knows nothing; rather, he doesn’t know everything we want him to know yet. But the knowledge he does have is the natural step on the road to deeper knowledge. &lt;strong&gt;What turns the inflexible knowledge of a beginning student into the flexible knowledge of an expert seems to be a lot more knowledge, more examples, and more practice. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247303129319"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/07/oh-vaccination-is-unnatural-getting-the-disease-is-so-much-better.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fa54c64590140c36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Vaccination"/><title type="html">Oh, Vaccination Is Unnatural -- Getting the Disease Is So Much Better</title><published>2009-07-11T08:10:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T08:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/07/oh-vaccination-is-unnatural-getting-the-disease-is-so-much-better.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stanford.wellsphere.com/autism-autism-spectrum-article/the-myth-of-mild-measles/418782"&gt;Kev Leitch writes:&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

One of the common arguments from vaccine rejectionists is “These diseases aren’t really that bad”. Often this includes graphs of death rates over time, with the suggestion that the diseases were already going away by themselves when the vaccination program started. It boggles the mind that intelligent people can make that claim, but they do.

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
The other argument is that with modern medicine and sanitation, the diseases were not a big problem. Again, mind boggling.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People will say, without any hint of irony, “I got the disease and I didn’t die.” The response being so obvious (the dead people aren’t here to speak) that I am astounded that these people make this claim.
&lt;/p&gt;

The first was a patient who had lost one of her 2 children in infancy. &amp;quot;Measles&amp;quot;, she said, matter-of-factly, when I asked her why. The other case was a patient in her fifties who came in for an unrelated problem, but had a lifelong severe disability because of a paralysed left side, and who had poorly-controlled epilepsy. I imagined these were the result of a congenital problem such as cerebral palsy. &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;, explained her carer. &amp;quot;It was encephalitis from measles&amp;quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Much of my time is spent battling illnesses that are largely unavoidable, but from time to time I see things that are totally preventable, like the measles cases last summer, and it rankles, big time. Knowing that there are those who actively campaign against vaccines makes me unspeakably angry
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/04/if_you_think_anti-vaccine_loons_are_just.php"&gt;If you think anti-vaccine loons are just crunchy left-wing New Agers, think again&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a measles outbreak in &lt;a href="http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7014758959"&gt;Montgomery County, Maryland.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The officials suspect that all the cases are related to an unvaccinated adult who came down with measles after a trip to China. He, in turn, infected a co-worker. Another adult and an eight-month-old child have all come down with the disease since then.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09100/961896-53.stm"&gt;There&amp;#39;s a measles outbreak in Allegany and Westmoreland Counties, Pennsylvania.
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
As predicted, the source of the measles outbreak in southwestern Pennsylvania was a foreign visitor, a child from India.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While neither the child nor any of five other people infected with measles have been identified, their whereabouts late in March included visits to Seven Springs Mountain Resort in Somerset-Fayette counties, Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, Alle-Kiski Medical Center in Natrona Heights and various trips on Allegheny County Port Authority buses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The state Department of Health and Allegheny County Health Department said other &amp;quot;probable&amp;quot; cases of infection await confirmation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But the source of infection was &amp;quot;a traveler from India&amp;quot; who arrived March 7 in the United States.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That the source was a child is confirmed by the investigation&amp;#39;s focus at Children&amp;#39;s Hospital, where two Westmoreland County preschool-age children contracted measles, which also infected their 33-year-old father.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.emaxhealth.com/1024/39/30498/mumps-outbreak-boston.html"&gt;There may be a mumps outbreak in Boston
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There is another outbreak of a “preventable” childhood disease. This one is not measles, but mumps. There are four Northeastern University students in Boston who are suspected of having mumps. Their symptoms are consistent with mumps, but the laboratory results are not back yet to confirm the diagnosis.
&lt;/p&gt;

Then I come back to reality where I realize “of course not, they are zealots, they can’t look at ANYTHING from another perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to a thought; we’ve had so many posts around here recently on empathy and how religions desire compassion and all this other fluffy bullshit, I realize that, if these religions really desire empathy and the ability to step back and look at the world from another viewpoint, why are they so hostile when someone tries to present them with another viewpoint? It could just be that it’s 2:35 A.M. and my brain is a bit slow at the moment, but it’s really an interesting thought. Empathy=good but contradiction=bad.&lt;/p&gt;

They just passed &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/08/a-brief-summary-of-the-ireland-blasphemy-law/"&gt;the blasphemy law&lt;/a&gt; by a single vote. It is now criminal to criticize a person’s religious views if you cause “outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion” whatever the hell that means. According to&lt;a href="http://www.palibandaily.com/2009/07/09/ireland-makes-blasphemy-illegal/"&gt; Paliban Daily&lt;/a&gt; here are some possibilities for how this new law might be interpreted in the future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atheists&lt;/strong&gt; can be prosecuted for saying that God is imaginary.  That causes outrage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pagans&lt;/strong&gt; can be prosecuted for saying they left Christianity because God is violent and bloodthirsty, promotes genocide, and permits slavery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christians&lt;/strong&gt; can be prosecuted for saying that Allah is a moon god, or for drawing a picture of Mohammed, or for saying that Islam is a violent religion which breeds terrorists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland’s Blasphemy Bill not only criminalizes free speech, it also gives the police the authority to confiscate anything deemed “blasphemous”. They may enter and search any premises, with force if needed, upon “reasonable suspicion” that such materials are present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The local Freethinkers society, with its copies of Hitchens’ &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446697966?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=paliban-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0446697966"&gt;God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none!important;margin:0!important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=paliban-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0446697966" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The video store, with copies of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CAPZBC?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=paliban-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000CAPZBC"&gt;The God Who Wasn’t There&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none!important;margin:0!important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=paliban-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B000CAPZBC" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The history teacher, who uses &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964487349?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=paliban-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0964487349"&gt;The Dark Side of Christian History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none!important;margin:0!important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=paliban-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0964487349" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt; to teach her class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The library, with its collection of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Frichpub%2Flistmania%2Ffullview%2FR2E94M0S7V02EA%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dcm%255Fsrch%255Fres%255Frpli%255Falt%255F1&amp;amp;tag=paliban-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957"&gt;books deemed blasphemous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none!important;margin:0!important" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=paliban-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even the homeowner who lets the wrong person know he has a copy of Salman Rushdie’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812976711?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=paliban-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0812976711"&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none!important;margin:0!important" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=paliban-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0812976711" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1"&gt; could find his door broken in by the Thought Police, his bookshelves ransacked, and his books burning in the front yard!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satirizing religion in any way, shape, or form, if it “causes outrage”, is now a prosecutable offense in Ireland. Saying anything negative about a religion, if it “causes outrage”, can now be prosecuted as a crime. Just like in Muslim countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ve decided to honor this new law by displaying a bunch of visual aids to educate the Irish as to what will no longer be tolerated in their country.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Isis is a tough woman to be married to.  I work a lot, I'm not home a lot, I hate to do laundry, I own way too many shoes (at least so says Mr. Isis), I've largely kicked him out of the master bathroom and closet, and sometimes I toy with him and test his love for me purely for sport.  We've been together a long time.  I have to keep our relationship novel somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years into our marriage I went to Mr. Isis and told him there was something I wanted to discuss.  I told him I thought our sex life had gotten stale and that I wanted him to let me pee on him.  In reality, I had no interest in this.  I just wondered if he'd say "yes"  and, if not, how hard I'd have to push to get him to say "yes."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/i_do_want_to_have_sex_just_not/shepee400.jpg" alt="shepee400.jpg" height="240" width="400"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2007/06/24/shepee400.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: Mr. Isis sensed that I was less than sincere in my request.  Mr. Isis  is an incredibly patient man.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Isis is excited to celebrate the beginning of her wedded bliss. So tonight she went over to one of her favorite little places and bought a little black something to wear to dinner with Mr. Isis tomorrow night.  She's not going to lie.  She's hoping that after Mr. Isis sees this little black something, he's going to show her a little bit of the &lt;i&gt;what is&lt;/i&gt;, if you know what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this as I tried on beautiful dresses this afternoon and marveled at the perkiness of my own amazing rack got me to thinking about something one of you little muffins sent me this week.  Blog darling &lt;a href="http://recoverlostmarbles.blogspot.com/2009/07/no-is-not-mixed-signal.html"&gt;LostMarbles&lt;/a&gt; wrote me the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;
Dear Dr. Isis,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am an admirer of your hot feminist stylings. I am also masochistic enough to have "feminism" as a search term for Google Alerts. I usually ignore the blatantly misogynistic results I get, but this morning as I was reading through my feed I noticed &lt;a href="http://malechauvinist.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-feminists-claim-rape-has-no.html"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; that had the phrase "Isis the Scientist" in the half sentence blurb and I had trouble ignoring things that are abso-fucking-lutely disturbing in content and malign the Goddess. I thought you might want to know about it as I don't know how much time you have to google yourself between doing hot science and doing your domestic goddess work. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My friend Hex and I also wrote a r&lt;a href="http://recoverlostmarbles.blogspot.com/2009/07/no-is-not-mixed-signal.html"&gt;eply to that post&lt;/a&gt; in my blog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forever your humble worshiper,&lt;br&gt;

For today, there was really no other choice for what bit of Classic Insolence to repost, except that, today, there's no insolence whatsoever. The reason is that today is a very sad day. It is the one year anniversary of the death of our beloved dog Echo. In 2008, about about three weeks before the day for which this is the one year anniversary, we noticed that Echo was favoring her hind leg. When I looked her over, I noticed a lump, which, thanks to the power of denial, I managed to convince myself was not cancer. (I'm a frikkin' cancer surgeon; I know a cancerous lump when I feel one, at least when it's obvious that it's cancer. Being rock hard is usually a good indication.) I still tear up a bit when I reread this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prelude: Sunday, June 22, 2008&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only three weeks ago. All seems well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prelude II: Thursday, July 3, 2008&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/hemangiosarcoma_canine_dog.php"&gt;We learn that all is not well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saturday, July 12, 2008, 6:30 AM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him &lt;br&gt;
traveled about &lt;br&gt;
The dog up and died, he up and died &lt;br&gt;
And after 20 years he still grieves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Mr. Bojangles&lt;/em&gt; by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, 1970&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is early Saturday morning, and I can no longer sleep. Preternaturally quiet, a shroud of silence blankets the house, oppressive, dark, and hateful. There aren't even any birds chirping, and puzzlingly I have yet to hear the shriek of the the whistle heralding the morning train that rumbles along the tracks less than a mile from our house at ridiculously early hours every morning. With a groan, I rouse myself from the couch, where I fell asleep last night and make my way to the refrigerator, looking for something to drink. Then I notice it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three fresh ears of uneaten corn sit in a clear plastic bag on the bottom shelf of our refrigerator. My wife purchased them for the family, but one of the ears will not be eaten. That's because Echo, our dog who delighted in eating corn off the cob just like a human being, died yesterday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/three_uneaten_ears_of_corn_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/three_uneaten_ears_of_corn_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/jFkJPUuwGu0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247285921458"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/evidence-based-revenge/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f85c204977e1903c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Evidence based revenge</title><published>2009-07-10T23:31:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T23:31:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/evidence-based-revenge/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Ben Goldacre</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247275058539"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13466">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ffa5ada720f6ed66</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Coexist Comedy</title><published>2009-07-11T01:00:42Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T01:00:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/10/coexist-comedy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s a collection of good-natured (SFW) religious/atheist humor, via the &lt;a href="http://www.coexistcomedy.com/"&gt;Coexist Comedy&lt;/a&gt; tour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006211" title=""&gt;Energy Stores Are Not Altered by Long-Term Partial Sleep Deprivation in Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent human studies reveal a widespread association between short sleep and obesity. Two hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, might explain this association. First, genetic factors that reduce endogenous sleep times might also impact energy stores, an assertion that we confirmed in a previous study. Second, metabolism may be altered by chronic partial sleep deprivation. Here we address the second assertion by measuring the impact of long-term partial sleep deprivation on energy stores using Drosophila as a model. We subjected flies to long-term partial sleep deprivation via two different methods: a mechanical stimulus and a light stimulus. We then measured whole-body triglycerides and glycogen, two important sources of energy for the fly, and compared them to un-stimulated controls. We also measured changes in energy stores in response to a random circadian clock shift. Sex and line-dependent alterations in glycogen and/or triglyceride levels occurred in response to the circadian clock shift and in flies subjected to a single night of sleep deprivation using light. Thus, consistent with previous studies, our findings suggest that acute sleep loss and changes to the circadian clock can alter metabolism. Significant changes in energy stores were also observed when flies were subjected to chronic sleep loss via the mechanical stimulus, although not the light stimulus. Interestingly, mechanical stimulation resulted in the same change in energy stores even when it was not associated with sleep deprivation, suggesting that the changes are caused by stress rather than sleep loss. These findings emphasize the importance of taking stress into account when evaluating the relationship between sleep loss and metabolism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006205" title=""&gt;Explaining Lengths and Shapes of Yeast by Scaling Arguments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lengths and shapes are approached in different ways in different fields: they serve as a read-out for classifying genes or proteins in cell biology whereas they result from scaling arguments in condensed matter physics. Here, we propose a combined approach with examples illustrated for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006198" title=""&gt;Certainty in Categorical Judgment of Size&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The certainty of judgment (or self-confidence) has been traditionally studied in relation with the accuracy. However, from an observer's viewpoint, certainty may be more closely related to the consistency of judgment than to its accuracy: consistent judgments are objectively certain in the sense that any external observer can rely on these judgments to happen. The regions of certain vs. uncertain judgment were determined in a categorical rating experiment. The participants rated the size of visual objects on a 5-point scale. There was no feedback so that there were no constraints of accuracy. Individual data was examined, and the ratings were characterized by their frequency distributions (or categories). The main result was that the individual categories always presented a core of certainty where judgment was totally consistent, and large peripheries where judgment was inconsistent. In addition, the geometry of cores and boundaries exhibited several phenomena compatible with the literature on visual categorical judgment. The ubiquitous presence of cores in absence of accuracy constraints provided insights about objective certainty that may complement the literature on subjective certainty (self-confidence) and the accuracy of judgment.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006194" title=""&gt;Decaying Raphia farinifera Palm Trees Provide a Source of Sodium for Wild Chimpanzees in the Budongo Forest, Uganda&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For some years, chimpanzees have been observed eating the pith of decaying palm trees of Raphia farinifera in the Budongo Forest, Uganda. The reasons for doing this have until now been unknown. An analysis of the pith for mineral content showed high levels of sodium to be present in the samples. By contrast, lower levels were found in bark of other tree species, and also in leaf and fruit samples eaten by chimpanzees. The differences between the Raphia samples and the non-Raphia samples were highly significant (p&amp;lt;0.001). It is concluded that Raphia provides a rich and possibly essential source of sodium for the Budongo chimpanzees. Comparison of a chewed sample (wadge) of Raphia pith with a sample from the tree showed a clear reduction in sodium content in the chewed sample. Black and white colobus monkeys in Budongo Forest also feed on the pith of Raphia. At present, the survival of Raphia palms in Budongo Forest is threatened by the use of this tree by local tobacco farmers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0006173" title=""&gt;Contemporary Parallel Diversification, Antipredator Adaptations and Phenotypic Integration in an Aquatic Isopod&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is increasingly being recognized that predation can be a strong diversifying agent promoting ecological divergence. Adaptations against different predatory regimes can emerge over short periods of time and include many different traits. We studied antipredator adaptations in two ecotypes of an isopod (Asellus aquaticus) that have, diverged in parallel in two Swedish lakes over the last two decades. We quantified differences in escape speed, morphology and behavior for isopods from different ecotypes present in these lakes. Isopods from the source habitat (reed) coexist with mainly invertebrate predators. They are more stream-profiled and have higher escape speeds than isopods in the newly colonized stonewort habitat, which has higher density of fish predators. Stonewort isopods also show more cautious behaviors and had higher levels of phenotypic integration between coloration and morphological traits than the reed isopods. Colonization of a novel habitat with a different predation regime has thus strengthened the correlations between pigmentation and morphology and weakened escape performance. The strong signature of parallelism for these phenotypic traits indicates that divergence is likely to be adaptive and is likely to have been driven by differences in predatory regimes. Furthermore, our results indicate that physical performance, behavior and morphology can change rapidly and in concert as new habitats are colonized.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_174.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/BZurhDDFjDE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247274887671"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/sheril_and_unscientific_americ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c656f58f32de1f7c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Sheril and Unscientific America at Quail Ridge Books</title><published>2009-07-10T22:54:37Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T22:54:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/aOBObJg5j_E/sheril_and_unscientific_americ.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/sheril_and_unscientific_americ.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://quailridgebooks.booksense.com/NASApp/store/IndexJsp?s=storeevents&amp;amp;eventId=426454" title=""&gt;Quail Ridge Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UNSCIENTIFIC AMERICA: HOW SCIENTIFIC ILLITERACY THREATENS OUR FUTURE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thursday, July 23 at 7:30 pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change, the energy crisis, nuclear proliferation -- many of the most urgent problems of the twenty-first century require science-based solution.  And yet Americans are paying less and less attention to scientists.  Journalist and author Chris Mooney (The Republican War on Science) and Duke scientist Sheril Kirshenbaum explain how religious ideologues, a weak education system, science-phobic politicians, and the corporate media have all collaborated to create this dangerous state of affairs.  They propose a broad array of initiatives that could reverse the current trend and call for the reintegration of science into public discourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheril Kirshenbaum is a marine scientist and research associate at Duke University.  She has served as a congressional science fellow and pop radio disc jockey.  She lives in Durham.&lt;/p&gt;

We all know it.  Many of us feel it.  So it's really exciting to hear that a state-contracted regional center managed its internal budget so well that it was over by $500,000--without reducing its quality of services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or--maybe not so exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, &lt;a href="http://www.cvrc.org/"&gt;Central Valley Regional Center&lt;/a&gt; took the $500,000 it saved and &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_12771547?nclick_check=1"&gt;distributed is as a pay raise, to the protest of the disability community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic Sen. Dean Florez and others said that money should have been spent to protect services essential to people with autism and cerebral palsy, or be returned to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're not saying that their staff don't deserve raises--our staffers would love a raise, too," said Ron Killingsworth, who represents the Central Valley Caucus of the California Disability Services Association. "But to spend half a million dollars on employee bonuses when we're facing huge cuts to programs for the developmentally disabled? We just don't understand." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional center claims they have good reason for the decision--they are concerned about employee retention as financial times get harder. The worry is that quality of services will decline in the future because better staff will not stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my bias will always side me with the folks wanting the money to be put into services and not into employee bonuses, the issue of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/75_pence"&gt;underpaying support staff&lt;/a&gt; isn't one that can just be ignored.  Underpaid staff are less likely to provide us--me--with quality service.  The question is where is the best balance?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247264486550"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/meet_our_second_moon.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0bf08e9a69e98d4d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><title type="html">Meet our Second Moon!</title><published>2009-07-11T01:54:33Z</published><updated>2009-07-11T01:54:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/meet_our_second_moon.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The inner Solar System is a pretty bizarre place.  Think about the giant planets in our Solar System -- the Jovian planets -- that weigh in from tens to hundreds the mass of Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/vt2004-if8-fig4.gif" width="500" alt="vt2004-if8-fig4.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These giant balls of gas are orbited by all sorts of interesting things, from moons so giant that they have their own &lt;i&gt;substantial&lt;/i&gt; atmospheres like Saturn's Titan:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/purple_titan.jpg" width="500" alt="purple_titan.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to &lt;a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-Neptune-Captured-Triton-23313.shtml"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; Kuiper Belt objects, like Neptune's &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/04/the_closest_kuiper_belt_object.php"&gt;giant moon, Triton&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/04/the_closest_kuiper_belt_object/triton2.gif" width="500" alt="Triton"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to regular &lt;i&gt;natural satellites&lt;/i&gt; that formed around the giant planets as they formed, such as Saturn's Dione and Enceladus:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/Occulting_Enceladus_PIA10500.jpg" width="500" alt="Occulting_Enceladus_PIA10500.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All told, if we look at all the moons in the Solar System, the gas giants have a virtual monopoly on them.  If we look at objects &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite#Natural_satellites_of_the_Solar_System"&gt;bigger than 100 km in diameter&lt;/a&gt;, Jupiter has 7, Saturn has 11, Uranus has 8, and Neptune has 6.  Hell, even &lt;a href="http://startswithabang.com/?p=1590"&gt;not-a-planet&lt;/a&gt; Pluto has 1, the same number as the entire inner Solar System:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/inner_planets_small_2.jpg" width="500" alt="inner_planets_small_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right.  Mercury and Venus have &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; moons, Earth has just the one big one, and Mars has two little captured asteroids (under 25 km apiece) that we generously call moons.  For comparison, Jupiter has &lt;i&gt;at least 49 satellites&lt;/i&gt; under 25 km, and Saturn has at least 43.  Well, if Mars has some captured asteroids, is it possible that Earth has a few, too?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you only knew...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/meet_our_second_moon/Cruithne.jpg" width="500" height="360" alt="Cruithne.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say hello to the (very poorly named) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3753_Cruithne"&gt;3753 Cruithne&lt;/a&gt;, a rock only about 5 km wide that follows us in our orbit!  What do I mean by that?  The Earth takes roughly 365 days to orbit the Sun.  3753 Cruithne takes 364 days to orbit the Sun, an impressively close number.  From the perspective of the Sun, we look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/meet_our_second_moon/Orbits_of_Cruithne_and_Earth.gif" width="480" height="360" alt="Orbits_of_Cruithne_and_Earth.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as seen from Earth, 3753 Cruithne makes a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit"&gt;horseshoe-shaped orbit&lt;/a&gt;!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/meet_our_second_moon/Horseshoe_orbit_of_Cruithne_from_the_perspective_of_Earth.gif" width="480" height="360" alt="Horseshoe_orbit_of_Cruithne_from_the_perspective_of_Earth.gif"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn't technically "our Moon" because it isn't gravitationally bound to us, and is actually expected to be ejected from our orbit in a few thousand years.  It will make a close approach to us in 2292, and there will be a gravitational encounter between this satellite and Earth.  The dynamics have already been worked out.  3753 Cruithne's orbit will change by about 500,000 km.  Earth's orbit?  Altered by &lt;b&gt;1.3 centimeters&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this so neat?  We've known for a long time about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_asteroid"&gt;Trojan asteroids&lt;/a&gt;, a group of around 1000 objects that stably orbit the Sun &lt;i&gt;near&lt;/i&gt; (but not &lt;i&gt;around&lt;/i&gt;) Jupiter:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/meet_our_second_moon/InnerSolarSystem-en.png" width="500" alt="InnerSolarSystem-en.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the very first time, we're starting to detect objects that may do this around Earth and Mars (which is up to four)!  Want to know what I find amazing?  Newton's law of gravitation, good old &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation"&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;p&gt;is all it takes to make all of this happen &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; to understand how.  My mind is blown for the week, and I hope yours is, too.

Should 350 employees of the Fresno-based Central Valley Regional Center have received bonuses of $1400 each, at a time when the state of California is facing a major fiscal crisis----a crisis that will most likely substantial cuts to programs for individuals with developmentally disabilities?  The July 7th &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_12771547"&gt;San Jose Mercury-News&lt;/a&gt; reports that all of California's Regional Centers were forced to cut their budgets by 3 percent, after the legislature was unable to fix the state's budget deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not saying that their staff don't deserve raises—our staffers would love a raise, too," said Ron Killingsworth, who represents the Central Valley Caucus of the California Disability Services Association. "But to spend half a million dollars on employee bonuses when we're facing huge cuts to programs for the developmentally disabled? We just don't understand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grandfather of a 9-year-old autistic girl, Chuck Genseal, is quoted as saying "'They're giving their employees bonuses at a time when the disability community doesn't know if they're going to have a safety net at the end of the week.'" Regional Center administrators argue that the bonuses will help employees with increased health-care and other costs and that "'there are tough times ahead.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent (bill-paying, bank account balance watching) part of me says, of course, the dollars should go to the people who need the services---seems like a no-brainer. Then other realities come to mind, like the therapists who've told us they had to stop working to "find a better paying job," or my extreme annoyance at seeing how much 1-on-1 aides earn---the very individuals who spend hours after hours with my son, patiently teaching him, helping him through his anxieties, and much more---versus, well, people who choose other more "prestigious" careers. If there aren't staff for programs, doesn't that mean there won't be programs? Or could the funds have been given directly to individuals with disabilities, so they could get the supports and services that they need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And were individuals with disabilities asked about what they thought about all this?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247261030578"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-8584620383210667167">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2ebf7237380565cb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Mad for the Moon</title><published>2009-07-10T20:23:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-13T15:15:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/m6uNprVEcqQ/mad-for-moon.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/8584620383210667167/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/07/mad-for-moon.html#comment-form" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/07/mad-for-moon.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Slelt7VxpkI/AAAAAAAAAC0/7n0ExYT3Kws/s1600-h/594px-Apollo_11_bootprint.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 0pt 10px 10px;float:right;width:198px;height:200px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_AFetE4zuDe4/Slelt7VxpkI/AAAAAAAAAC0/7n0ExYT3Kws/s200/594px-Apollo_11_bootprint.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;On &lt;strike&gt;June&lt;/strike&gt; July 20th, 1969, more than five hundred million people witnessed a monumental scientific achievement in the most viewed television event of its day.  With the fortieth anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s first steps on the moon coming up this month, we’re reminded of science’s ability to inspire us as well as human innovation and creativity’s capacity to advance our kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the invention of language, people have romanticized and marveled at the soft glowing orb that passes us by nightly.  Whether it was&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_god"&gt; worshiping it as a God&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC1HT3UjyDA"&gt;promising it to a loved one&lt;/a&gt;, the moon has always fascinated humanity - Hollywood is no different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From George Melies’ early silent film &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgJXnK64yyk"&gt;A TRIP TO THE MOON&lt;/a&gt;, to Duncan Jones’ &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0j_ONmVcXA"&gt;MOON&lt;/a&gt;, there will always be compelling story to tell in moon adventures.  Just as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRbkBAOGEw"&gt;JFK captured our imagination&lt;/a&gt; with the promise that a man would walk on the moon in 1961, so does Hollywood today as it postulates on the future, dreaming of colonies and space stations.  And if history is any measure, the science fiction films we see today will inspire technical innovation and new technologies in future generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[CORRECTION: The moon landing occurred on &lt;i&gt;July &lt;/i&gt;20th, 1969, not &lt;i&gt;June &lt;/i&gt;20th.

&lt;p&gt;Today’s responses from the forums are to the question: “What trait of your autistic child would you most like to see more in yourself or in others?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“His genuine smile,” said one respondent. “His innocence,” said another. “Laugh, just because it feels good,” replied a third. “Spend the whole day playing, with no other cares in the world.  View people as strangers only as long as it takes to greet them with a hug, then they are instantly my friends.  Take everyone at face value, no assumption/concept of hidden agendas or ulterior motives. Courage to take people by the hand and show them what I want or need to be happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another parent admired “his amazing ability to tell it like it is. I find that most of us in the world tend to sugarcoat things to make seem better than what they actually are.  In our society it’s a deficit, but should it really be one?” Said another: “My boys are generally happy, smiling kids. I’m working on that trait myself trying to shed the worry about the future and find joy in the simple things in life as my boys do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The can-do attitude.  A positive self image is a great asset,” said another. ”The overwhelming need to tell the truth,” said another. “Painful at times, or wonderful, but only the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“His ability to analyze, and his perseverance,” said another parent. “Most of the world gives up too easily, and doesn’t go deep enough in topics that interest them. This is a really great question for parents by the way. Our ability to help our children hinges on our capability to realize that what we call deficits are simply traits, that are seen negatively or positively depending on context. By identifying the traits for what they are, we can use them to derive situations (educationally at first, later on socially) for our kids in which their traits can be an asset.”&lt;/p&gt;

You just can't see through it all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In general, this should hold true for planets. Until the star clears out the dusty disk, the planets will remain hidden, even &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; we could spatially resolve them. So &lt;a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0004-637X/700/1/820"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; talking about forming planets with “Observable Signatures” in the title caught my eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this paper, the author explains something that, at first glance, is actually counter-intuitive: These dusty shells may &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; find newly forming planets. The reason is that, as planets form, they will slowly accumulate the material around them. In the vertical direction, this has the effect of making a “dimple” in the proto-planetary disk proportional to the planet's accumulated mass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the author, the dimple will appear observationally as a “shadow”. She doesn't completely explain why this is and it seems somewhat strange to me. The reason is that “shadows” are usually caused by something that &lt;i&gt;blocks&lt;/i&gt; light. Although the forming planet would cast a (relatively) small shadow that would be lost in the disk, it's not at all clear what would cause a shadow in the dimple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rather, I suspect a better word choice would have been to say there would be a “darkening” in the dimple. This would make more sense to me, since the dimple would be a lower density and have less material to scatter light propagating along the plane. Less light means that, relative to the rest of the disk, it would appear darker. Thus, I'm pretty sure that's the actual mechanism at work here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there's another interesting component: On the side of the dimple that's &lt;i&gt;further&lt;/i&gt; from the parent star, there's a &lt;i&gt;brightening&lt;/i&gt;! Weird huh?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This again, is not well explained in the paper, but I suspect the reason for this has something to do with the angle at which the photons coming through the disk are striking the side of the dimple. Either that or it's the opposite of the darkening effect where suddenly the boost in numbers of photons that were allowed to flow relatively freely through the empty space created by the dimple are suddenly again encountering a relatively dense medium again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of how these effects should be created, planets should show a dark spot next to a brighter spot with the sizes proportional to their mass. But should these be observationally detectable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the paper, yes. These features would be most readily observable in the visible to near-IR bands. The real limiting factor would be how well we're able to spatially resolve these dimples. Obviously, the further away a system would be, the smaller it would appear. Even for the largest planets simulated (50 Earth masses), the dimple is about 3 AU across. That means that we'd need to be able to resolve &lt;i&gt;half&lt;/i&gt; of that to see both the darkened and lightened portions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tossing that into the small angle equation and assuming a fairly typical resolution for a good telescope of 1arcsec, we get that we should be able to observe these systems out to 3.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; AU or 4.9 ly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eep!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's not very far at all! In fact, the only stars that fall in that range are the stars in the Alpha Centauri trinary star system. The next closest one after that (Barnard's star) is 5.9 ly away!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hubble can get down to ~0.1arcseconds of resolution, which would mean 10x further, but there's still not really any star forming regions within 40 ly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So ultimately, while this technique is interesting it doesn't seem the least bit practical with the current generation of telescopes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;amp;rft.jtitle=The+Astrophysical+Journal&amp;amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1088%2F0004-637X%2F700%2F1%2F820&amp;amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&amp;amp;rft.atitle=PLANET+SHADOWS+IN+PROTOPLANETARY+DISKS.+II.+OBSERVABLE+SIGNATURES&amp;amp;rft.issn=0004-637X&amp;amp;rft.date=2009&amp;amp;rft.volume=700&amp;amp;rft.issue=1&amp;amp;rft.spage=820&amp;amp;rft.epage=831&amp;amp;rft.artnum=http%3A%2F%2Fstacks.iop.org%2F0004-637X%2F700%2Fi%3D1%2Fa%3D820%3Fkey%3Dcrossref.7166aae0c44438bb790e547560fcee89&amp;amp;rft.au=Jang-Condell%2C+H.&amp;amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Astronomy"&gt;Jang-Condell, H.

&lt;p&gt;Ireland passed &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/08/a-brief-summary-of-the-ireland-blasphemy-law/"&gt;the blasphemy law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for Irish citizens?  It means you can be convicted for trashing someone’s beliefs if you cause “outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion.”  (Again, what is a “substantial number”?  Who knows.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.palibandaily.com/2009/07/09/ireland-makes-blasphemy-illegal/"&gt;Paliban Daily&lt;/a&gt; offers up some frightening consequences, given that “blasphemy” isn’t very well-defined:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atheists&lt;/strong&gt; can be prosecuted for saying that God is imaginary.  That causes outrage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pagans&lt;/strong&gt; can be prosecuted for saying they left Christianity because God is violent and bloodthirsty, promotes genocide, and permits slavery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christians&lt;/strong&gt; can be prosecuted for saying that Allah is a moon god, or for drawing a picture of Mohammed, or for saying that Islam is a violent religion which breeds terrorists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jews&lt;/strong&gt; can be prosecuted for saying Jesus isn’t the Messiah.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aren’t all accurate… for example, Jews can say Jesus isn’t the Messiah because their religious beliefs are protected under the law.  But I suspect if they went around saying as much, holding posters that said he wasn’t the Messiah in a dickish sort of way, and made a “substantial number” of Christians angry, then we’d have problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also told that academic and theological debate isn’t subject to the rules.  But again, it’s tough to say what constitutes those kinds of debates.  Can bloggers tear apart religious arguments and those who make them if they’re not professors?  Can Irish people call certain Catholic priests rapists and attribute it to their faith and just say it’s part of theological debate?  Can we call out certain adherents of a fundamentalist version of Islam as terrorists if that is warranted?  Either everything in these categories is blasphemy or nothing is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law also allows for “Seizure of copies of blasphemous statements” (Provided you have been convicted of blasphemy already and the police have a warrant.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, what does that mean for Irish citizens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Ireland’s Blasphemy Bill not only criminalizes free speech, it also gives the police the authority to confiscate anything deemed “blasphemous”. They may enter and search any premises, with force if needed, upon “reasonable suspicion” that such materials are present.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve already been convicted of blasphemy, you better hold on tight to that copy of &lt;em&gt;God is Not Great&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least we can be sure that this law will be tested repeatedly by any fierce advocate of free speech.  My hope is that in the process, we hear even more “blasphemy” than usual challenging this bill, leading to an eventual repeal of the law altogether.  &lt;/p&gt;

It received the prestegious Seiun award for the manga in 2002 and for the anime in 2005 (the famous series &lt;i&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/i&gt; won this award in 2000). Even among rabid anime fans, it's gone largely under the radar. I suspect this is because it doesn't fit the norm of being ridiculously over the top; There's no giant mecha, no magic powers, no crazy transformations, no ninjas.... oh wait. There's ninjas. But not in the normal anime way....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead &lt;i&gt;Planetes&lt;/i&gt; is a very subdued series that focuses more on character development and complex yet subtly highlighted issues rather than the in your face action. The series takes place in the near future when space debris has reached a level so critical that it's requiring international clean up efforts. The main characters in this series are debris haulers in charge of this zero-G cleanup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For an anime series, the science is unexpectedly good. There's frequent talk of transfer orbits, Van-Allen Belts, relative motions, dangers of radiation sickness, muscle degeneration in weightless environments, and other things that, in most series, I'd expect to be filled with techno-babble. But in this series, it's apparent the writers did their research and yet, it's not even boisterous about it. Whereas many series that have to do similar research for accuracy will take the time to show it off (usually by having awkward lines of someone having to explain the concept to someone that should already understand it), &lt;i&gt;Planetes&lt;/i&gt; drops it in seamlessly, merging into an unusually harmonious background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I mentioned, the series manages to touch on many very human themes throughout the 26 episode run. It tackles the place of humanity in the universe, class divisions, terrorism, the difference between ambition and greed, and isolation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's one of the best series I've watched in a long while. If you're into anime and haven't seen it, I'd recommend picking it up when you have the chance.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-5622053824597760254?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247253718661"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/open_access_in_belgrade.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e24dce3938978966</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Balkans"/><title type="html">Open Access in Belgrade</title><published>2009-07-10T16:12:12Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T16:12:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/9l2U5Yar-zQ/open_access_in_belgrade.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/open_access_in_belgrade.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you know, I gave two lectures here in Belgrade. The first one, at the University Library on Monday, and the second one at the Oncology Institute of the School of Medicine at the University of Belgrade. As the two audiences were different (mainly librarians/infoscientists at the first, mainly professors/students of medicine at the second) I geared the two talks differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can listen to the audio of the entire thing (the second talk) &lt;a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ezmmidnywro" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, see some pictures (from both talks) &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14969724@N04/sets/72157620904628335/" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and read (in Serbian) a blog post &lt;a href="http://ncrcbiblioteka.blogspot.com/2009/07/bora-zivkovic-presented-plos-one.html" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, written by incredible Ana Ivkovic who organized my entire Belgrade "tour" this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk was, at the last minute, moved from the amphitheater to the library, which was actually good as the online connection is, I hear, much much better in the library. Library got crowded, but in the end everyone found a chair. What I did, as I usually do, was to come in early and open up all the websites I wanted to show in reverse chronological order, each in a separate window. Thus, the site I want to show first is on top at the beginning. When I close that window, the second site is the top window, then the third, etc. Thus I do the talk by closing windows instead of opening them (and hoping and praying that would not take too much time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how talks usually go in the States, I prepared to talk for about 50 minutes. But, when I hit the 50 minute mark, I realized that nobody was getting restless - everyone was looking intently, jotting down URLs of sites I was showing, nodding....so I continued until I hit 60 minutes as which time I decided to wrap up and end. Even then, nobody was eager to get up and leave. I was hoping I'd get a question anyway....and sure, I got 45 minutes of questions. Then another 20 minutes or so of people approaching me individually to ask questions....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href="http://www.doaj.org/" title=""&gt;Directory of Open Access Journals&lt;/a&gt; as the backdrop to give a brief history of the Open Access movement, the difference between Free Access and Open Access and the distinction between Green OA and Gold OA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I used the &lt;a href="http://www.plos.org/journals/index.php" title=""&gt;PLoS.org&lt;/a&gt; site to explain the brief history of PLoS and the differences between our seven journals. Of course, this being medical school, I gave some special consideration to &lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/home.action" title=""&gt;PLoS Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I used the &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005723" title=""&gt;Ida - Darwinius massillae&lt;/a&gt; paper to explain the concept of PLoS ONE, how our peer-review is done and to show/demonstrate the functionalities on our papers, e.g., ratings, notes, comments, article-level metrics and trackbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I used the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/waltzing_matilda_-_why_were_th.php" title=""&gt;Waltzing Matilda&lt;/a&gt; paper to enumerate some additional reasons why Open Access is a Good.Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trackbacks were also a good segue into the seriousness by which the scientific and medical community is treating blogs these days. I showed &lt;a href="http://speakingofmedicine.plos.org/" title=""&gt;Speaking of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://everyone.plos.org/" title=""&gt;EveryONE blog&lt;/a&gt; as examples of blogs we use for outreach and information to our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed and explained &lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/" title=""&gt;ResearchBlogging.org&lt;/a&gt; (which they seemed to particularly be taken with and jotted down the URL), showed and explained the visibility and respect of such blogging networks as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/" title=""&gt;Scienceblogs.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/" title=""&gt;Nature Network&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="http://www.connotea.org/" title=""&gt;Connotea&lt;/a&gt; as an example of various experiments in Science 2.0 that Nature is conducting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put in a plug for &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline&lt;/a&gt; conferences and the &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823" title=""&gt;Open Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; anthologies as yet another proof how seriously Science 2.0 and science blogging is now being taken in the West. Then showed &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/100-scientific-twitter-friends" title=""&gt;515 scientists on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/the-life-scientists" title=""&gt;The Life Scientists group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/medicine-2-0-microcarnival" title=""&gt;Medicine 2.0 Microcarnival&lt;/a&gt; on FriedFeed as examples of the ways scientists are now using microblogging platforms for communication and collaboration. I pointed out how &lt;a href="http://freelancingscience.com/" title=""&gt;Pawel Szczesny&lt;/a&gt;, through blogging and FriendFeed, got collaborations, publications, and in the end, his current job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I described Jean-Claude Bradley's concept (and practice) of Open Notebook Science and showed &lt;a href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Main_Page" title=""&gt;OpenWetWare&lt;/a&gt; as a platform for such work. I pointed out that Wikipedia and wiki-like projects are now edited by scientists, showing the examples of &lt;a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0060175" title=""&gt;A Gene Wiki for Community Annotation of Gene Function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://biogps.gnf.org/" title=""&gt;BioGPS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.chemspider.com/" title=""&gt;ChemSpider&lt;/a&gt; and ended by pointing out a couple of examples of the ways the Web &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/coturnix/bfd04a36/citizen-science-online" title=""&gt;allows citizen scientists&lt;/a&gt; to participate in massive collaborative research projects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But probably the most important part of the talk was my discussion of the drawbacks of Impact Factor and the current efforts to develop Article-level metrics to replace it - something that will be particularly difficult to change in developing countries yet is essential especially for them to be cognizant of and to move as fast as they can so as not to be left behind as the new scientific ecosystem evolves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/open_access_in_belgrade.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/9l2U5Yar-zQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247253466778"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7966">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/63f64b040667aaa0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">AI: Resetting and refreshing</title><published>2009-07-10T19:00:08Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T19:00:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=7966" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1beafebbab2576c2ae4319408c7858f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the debauchery that was &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=7230/"&gt;SkepchickCON&lt;/a&gt; last week, it’s amazing I survived to make it to &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM 7&lt;/a&gt;, which is where I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who aren’t familiar with it, The Amaz!ng Meeting is sponsored by the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;JREF&lt;/a&gt; and is a place for skeptics to gather, learn, talk and drink. I’ve been to every one since TAM 4 and I intend to go to every other one I can.  TAM is my “Mecca.” It’s where I go to renew, refresh and revive my skepticism, my friendships and my perspective on life. I never come back from TAM without a brand new set of ideas and a renewed excitement about everything we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about you? What do you do to refresh and revive your skepticism, in a world full of pseudoscience and shams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 1:&lt;/strong&gt;  I got a copy of the paper, and on a fast first reading things are both more complicated and more subtle than they appear from the various news stories.  The paper offers a model by means of which they (purport to) essentially partition the phenotypic change in the sheep population into a portion due to phenotypic plasticity in the face of environmental change and a portion due to “evolution.”  “Evolution” as it is used in the news stories (and, it appears, in the paper) is construed very narrowly as an adaptive change in the genetic composition of the population due to natural selection.  Somewhere Larry Moran is gnashing his teeth.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More later, after I read the paper a couple of times (or not, if a popgen person chimes in knowledgeably).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;===========&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted the gist of this as a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/one_rotten_apple.php#comment-1766182" rel="external "&gt;comment on Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, but in view of the recent dustups over science reporting I thought I’d promote it to a brief post here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comment was on PZ’s report of Ben Goldacre’s analysis of some &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/asking-for-it/" rel="external "&gt;really lousy science reporting&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;.  And it’s truly crummy reporting, distorted and sensationalized.  But there are also the casual errors, little misrepresentations that slip into stories almost unconsciously.  For example, in the Guardian’s &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jul/02/shrinking-sheep-climate-change" rel="external "&gt;recent story about ‘shrinking’ sheep&lt;/a&gt; there’s this little jewel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case involves a rare herd of wild sheep on the remote Scottish island - known in Scottish Gaelic as Hirta - that are refusing to bow to conventional evolutionary pressure, which says big is best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary pressure says big is best?  Gaaah!  And &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidadam" rel="external "&gt;the reporter&lt;/a&gt; has a Ph.D. in chemical engineering and is the Guardian’s environment correspondent, having previously worked for &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.  Lovely.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Hemant, I’ve been watching the imminent appointment of &lt;strong&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/strong&gt; to head the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Hemant, I’ve been very… apprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, I worry that he will bring religion into everything, partly in an official capacity.  On the first three pages of his book, he writes about how he “&lt;strong&gt;felt compelled to invoke a connection with God&lt;/strong&gt;” (his words) in his and then-president Clinton’s statements during a 2000 press conference (Collins was in charge of the Human Genome Project at the time).  (&lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/05/mixing-science-religion-and-politics.html"&gt;via Sandwalk&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2222562/pagenum/all/"&gt;the Salon piece&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Wilson did a little to assuage my fears, but not enough.  &lt;strong&gt;Hemant &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/10/a-few-more-thoughts-on-francis-collins-2/"&gt;approvingly quoted this passage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This formula [between the "unsolved" and the "unsolvable"] offers a convenient litmus test for where Collins falls on a variety of questions: If a given problem appears to be merely unsolved, then he’ll leave it to the realm of science; if, on the other hand, Collins deems a question to be unsolvable, it’s fair game for inclusion in a spiritual interpretation of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt slightly better, but the very next paragraph mentioned that Collins considers human displays of apparent altruism “unsolvable by science”.  I consider it very important to study human behavior of all kinds – will Collins declare some better served by “spiritual interpretation” than science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if Collins considers things to be unsolvable by science, why would he assume that spirituality is right and not just &lt;a href="http://www.jesusandmo.net/2008/12/17/edge/"&gt;making stuff up&lt;/a&gt;?  My &lt;a href="http://blog.thehumanist.com/?p=328"&gt;very first blog post at Rant &amp;amp; Reason&lt;/a&gt;, before I was even a full staff member at the American Humanist Association, was criticizing Collins’ understanding of the interaction between faith and science:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Collins wrote in his book:] “Science is not the only way of knowing. The spiritual worldview provides another way of finding truth. Scientists who deny this would be well advised to consider the limits of their own tools…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins’ point simply doesn’t follow.  To say that there are limitations to science lends no credibility to spirituality’s ability to find truth. It would be like saying, “Space shuttles are not the only way to get into orbit around the Earth. Pogo sticks are another way. Engineers who deny this would be well advised to consider the limits of their shuttles.” Sure, shuttles have things they can’t do, but that does not mean pogo sticks can go into orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worries me that the head of the NIH has an untenable view of the relation between science and religion, is involved with groups like the Templeton Foundation, and feels compelled to invoke religion during official speeches.  Let’s see how it pans out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jesse Galef</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Friendly Atheist</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247250303755"><id gr:original-id="http://friendlyatheist.com/?p=13631">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec7a82f02adeb725</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><title type="html">A Few More Thoughts on Francis Collins</title><published>2009-07-10T16:37:44Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T16:37:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/10/a-few-more-thoughts-on-francis-collins-2/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;After writing &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/09/francis-collins-named-head-of-national-institute-of-health/"&gt;my own thoughts&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Francis Collins&lt;/strong&gt; and his appointment to head the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2222562/pagenum/all/"&gt;I read this piece&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Chris Wilson&lt;/strong&gt; at Slate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two excerpts stood out to me, addressing the concerns of many atheists:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This formula [between the &amp;quot;unsolved&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;unsolvable&amp;quot;] offers a convenient litmus test for where Collins falls on a variety of questions: If a given problem appears to be merely unsolved, then he’ll leave it to the realm of science; if, on the other hand, Collins deems a question to be unsolvable, it’s fair game for inclusion in a spiritual interpretation of the universe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… [Collins] thinks the presence of the divine can be directly observed, even if it cannot be measured and tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an audacious claim for any scientist to make, and &lt;strong&gt;Collins does not deserve a free pass on this from the scientific community. He is also undeserving of suspicions that he harbors a conservative Christian agenda.&lt;/strong&gt; As it happens, the most salient point raised by his critics tends to work in his favor. Jerry Coyne rightly describes Collins as a talented administrator. After all, he led the public effort to sequence the human genome and loves to point out that he did it “ahead of schedule and under budget.” That’s the most important virtue for the job he is about to undertake. If Collins’ faith mollifies even a few political conservatives who would otherwise continue to waste time and money fighting research efforts that violate their specific religious tenets, then the benefits of his faith should outweigh whatever qualms scientists might have.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Believe it or not, I'll even be on a panel later today! While I'm gone, I'll probably manage to do a new post or two, but, in the meantime, while I'm away communing with fellow skeptics at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2006.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have to apologize for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_mere_regularity_1.php"&gt;last week's Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;. No, I'm not apologizing for the subject matter (the obsession that reigns supreme among some alties with "cleansing" one's colon to "purge toxins" and achieve the super-regularity of several bowel movements a day). Rather, I'm sorry I didn't point out just how disgusting one of the &lt;a href="http://www.drnatura.com/"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; I included was, because among all the glowing testimonials for how great colon cleansers felt after having supposedly rid themselves of all that nasty fecal matter caked on the walls of their colons and achieved the Nirvana of many bowel movements a day (or, as one happy customer put it, "awesome adventures in the bathroom" and another put it, "I have not noticed anything really weird come out of me yet, but I am sure that there will be"), there were also links to various pictures people took of their own poop, complete with graphic descriptions. You're warned now if you click. One reader asked if the Dr. Natura site was the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_mere_regularity_1.php#comment-178678"&gt;grossest thing on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;." Sadly, I had to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_mere_regularity_1.php#comment-178686"&gt;assure&lt;/a&gt; the reader, that is not the case, not by a longshot. However, I won't reveal links to anything even grosser. I'll leave that as an exercise for interested readers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having posted last week's woo deconstruction, I thought about what a suitable followup would be for this week. I thought of going back to deconstruct &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_its_no.php"&gt;quantum homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;, but realized that (1) even though I had intentionally &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_mere_regularity_1.php"&gt;dived&lt;/a&gt; into some really--shall we say?--earthbound stuff in order to purge my brain of the quantum woo, I had not yet achieved a total purge of my mind of that particular woo comparable to the total purge of the colon of its feces that Dr. Natura and its customers seek, which suggests that at least one more purge is needed; (2) I'm having trouble thinking of new jokes about quantum homeopathy and am therefore forced to regurgitate the same old material about quantum entanglement between my neurons and those of Lionel Milgrom every week (oops, I did it again); and (3) there is indeed a very logical followup to colon cleanses to discuss (logical as a followup, not as an actual treatment) that is very interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for liver flushes? Of course you are. Don't you want a way to "&lt;a href="http://www.curezone.com/cleanse/liver/"&gt;remove gallstones without surgery&lt;/a&gt;"?&lt;/p&gt;

But employment discrimination can also be subtle, insidious, and even culturally sanctioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Story:  County social services, wowed by a person's skills, wants to hire the person--until they find out the person is also a client of county social services.  There is a rule in the office that the county can not employ anyone who receives county DD services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Story:  Person with an impressive set of skills is hired--but not for their actual skills, only as a representative of a person with a disability on the staff.  When the person attempts to apply their actual skills to the job, they are told their skills are not wanted (in fact, that the person even possesses such skills is actively denied), and they are only wanted in their capacity as a PWD, not as a professional in any of the ways they have been trained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Story: Dora says, "Why aren't there any self-advocates on your autism committee, only parent advocates?"  Committee member answers, "Oh, because those parent advocates have other skills that they can contribute to the committee."  (It does not cross anyone's mind that the same might also be true of self-advocates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Story: Autistic person who has appropriate credentials does a training series for education workers on how to work better with students on the spectrum.  The education workers ask for personal details about the trainer's life: details about the trainer's marriage, mental health, and childhood.  The education workers do not ask for details related to the content of the training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True Story:  An appropriately credentialed graduate student attempts to hook up with an academic group involved in assistive technology design.  The student is instantly dismissed with no further discussion because the student is an end user of the type of assistive technology being developed--the principle investigator (even after some coaching by others) simply can not fathom how someone who uses the technology could possibly have anything useful to contribute to its design (the fact that this is a grad student looking for research experience like any grad student is completely ignored).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is, none of these things would happen to someone who wasn't on the spectrum.  These are clear cases of discrimination.  However, there is no recourse to them.  They are socially sanctioned as acceptable forms of discrimination.  They exist because of &lt;em&gt;attitudes&lt;/em&gt;.  Because of how disabled people or autistic people are perceived.  That we are only good for work that has to do with our disability, and that we are not useful in any other way.  That what makes us "remarkable" is our knowledge of being autistic or being disabled, but never our knowledge of things like graphic design, computer programming, engineering, nursing, or whatever else is in our actual skill sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-discrimination laws alone do not solve discrimination problems.  A paradigm shift in how society sees us is equally necessary.  Else these sorts of stories will continue to be told.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247247694865"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4762827614191702843.post-1509395176250145869">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7fe209bf5b5e9929</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Simon Singh" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Edzard Ernst" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="British Chiropractic Association" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="BCA" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="The Discredited BCA" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="BMJ" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">BMJ: The "Plethora" Has Been Completely Demolished</title><published>2009-07-10T16:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T16:44:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/2009/07/bmj-plethora-has-been-demolished.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://jackofkent.blogspot.com/" type="html">In what seems a potentially devastating blow to the British Chiropractic Association, an &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/jul08_4/b2783"&gt;editorial in the current British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt; says the following of &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/339/jul08_4/b2766"&gt; the review by Edzard Ernst of the BCA's 'plethora' of evidence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"His demolition of the 18 references is, to my mind, complete."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read this aloud, slowly; and then imagine this sentence being read out in court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is surely devastating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For after a &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; demolition, of course, there will not be a &lt;em&gt;jot&lt;/em&gt; remaining.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ernst also make very interesting points indeed as to the completeness of the references and whether the BCA did or should have known better.

The ceremonies were opened by Randi himself, and below is a transcript of his talk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings, all! First, welcome to The Amaz!ng Meeting 7. The JREF staff and I have been repeatedly astonished – if not “amazed” – at the steady growth of this annual event, and we are appropriately grateful and humble for your presence here.  But, I must explain my somewhat subdued appearance…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I call a major bummer.  During a routine medical examination more than a month ago, it was discovered that I had a nasty visitor inside me – yet another stunning example of Intelligent Design at work, friends.  My doctors went in and removed it, and things are looking up again.  I’ll be pretty weak for a couple of months, but I assure you all that I’m fighting this thing with the very best technical help – I’m not at all shy about embracing technology! – and I’ll be able to keep up with my regular duties as the treatment proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason you’ve not seen any recent videos from me.  Of course, I’m very fortunate to have good folks like Phil Plait, that Bad Astronomer, along with the ever-present, ever-diligent, and very fierce Linda Shallenberger, to back me up.  They stepped in to manage and resuscitate TAM 7, and I think the results speak for themselves…!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>randi@randi.org (James Randi)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247246798491"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14815">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d71ad8f726f83f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="supply and demand"/><category term="wine"/><title type="html">Loneliness or Cheap Wine</title><published>2009-07-10T17:17:56Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T17:17:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/loneliness-or-cheap-wine/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">I'm alone in Europe, living in an apartment and cooking for myself.

I don’t think blogs will ever supplant newspapers and magazines, nor I do I think they’re killing them like a parasite destroying its host. In fact, blogs may be able to act as a new kind of quality-control mechanism. I know that not all my colleagues on the old-media side of the divide are so optimistic. You’d be hard-pressed to find a snootier distillation of their scorn than something&lt;em&gt; Independent&lt;/em&gt; science editor Steve Connor &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/steve-connor-lofty-medics-should-stick-to-their-day-job-1724485.html"&gt;wrote recently&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sixth World Conference of Science Journalists is underway in London. I can’t say it’s going to change my life, as I missed out on the previous five, but I did notice that it has attracted the attention of a bunch of medics with strong views on the state of science journalism today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A few of us felt they were might [sic] not adequately address some of the key problems in their profession, which has deteriorated to the point where they present a serious danger to public health,” according to the Bad Science website of Dr Ben Goldacre, who is turning into the bête noir of science journalists. The medics met in a pub in London last night to explain why the “mainstream media’s science coverage is broken, misleading, dangerous, lazy, venal and silly”. All three speakers are gainfully employed by the public sector so they don’t actually have to worry too much about the sort of pressures and financial constraints the mainstream media are under. But they nevertheless condescended to offer some advice on the sort of “best practice guidelines” I should be following, for which I suppose I should be eternally grateful.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But their arrogance is not new. Medical doctors in particular have always had a lofty attitude to the media’s coverage of their profession, stemming no doubt from the God-like stance they take towards their patients. Although I wouldn’t go as far as to say their profession is broken, dangerous, lazy, venal and silly – not yet anyway.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/steve-connor-is-getting-eggy/"&gt;as Goldacre pointed out,&lt;/a&gt; Connor got the date wrong and didn’t bother to check to see if the other two speakers were medics. They’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly true that the mainstream media are under plenty of “pressures and financial constraints” these days. But that can’t be an excuse for lousy science reporting–ie, distorting new research, hyping findings way beyond what they support, or writing straight off of press releases. In fact, just the opposite: professional science writers should strive to be &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqnsRqSo2k"&gt;most excellent&lt;/a&gt; if they want people to continue to read them faithfully. And they have to toughen their hides enough to be able to handle criticism from scientists themselves. If those criticisms are wrong, show why. If they are on-target, science writers must swallow the bitter medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning brought an example of how not to cope with these changes to the media landscape. On June 23 the &lt;em&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;’s science correspondent &lt;a href="http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=42219&amp;amp;sectioncode=1"&gt;Richard Alleyne&lt;/a&gt; wrote an article with the headline, “Women who dress provocatively more likely to be raped, claim scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldacre decided to call up the scientist who supposedly made this claim (I thought that’s what reporters do, not just bête noirs). She was furious at the distortion. Goldacre reports his conversation in &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/asking-for-it/"&gt;a July 4 Bad Science post&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/04/bad-science-rape-study-telegraph"&gt;his column&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to check out the original article. But I couldn’t find it. If you type in &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/search/?queryText=alleyne+rape&amp;amp;Search=Search"&gt;Alleyne and rape into the Telegraph’s search window&lt;/a&gt;, you get the story as the top results. Click on the story, and you are delivered to a url that looks promising:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/5603052/Women-who-dress-provocatively-more-likely-to-be-raped-claim-scientists.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once you get to that page, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/5603052/Women-who-dress-provocatively-more-likely-to-be-raped-claim-scientists.html"&gt;all you get to read is&lt;/a&gt;, “Sorry, we cannot find the page you are looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No correction. No clarification. No apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then hunted around on some online news databases–the databases that future generations will turn to to research the news of our time. I can find Richard Alleyne’s stories at the Telegraph from both before and after the rape story. But not the rape story itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has, as far as I can tell, been disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I dropped a note to the Telegraph to ask what happened. I even found Richard Alleyne on Twitter and dropped him a note too. No response so far. I will post anything I receive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the bête noirs are being listened to. And that is good. But pretending that the objects of their ire never existed? Mmm, not so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Nepostistic hat tip to &lt;a href="http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/contributors/10"&gt;brother Ben&lt;/a&gt;, Internet archaeologist extraordinaire, who dredged up &lt;a href="http://thehandmirror.blogspot.com/2009/07/compare-and-contrast.html"&gt;a copy of the full article on another blog&lt;/a&gt;, which compares it to the original press release. Not quite down the memory hole yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update #2, July 22: Goldacre now &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/rape-a-non-correction-from-the-telegraph/"&gt;tells us&lt;/a&gt; that on July 13 the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; published &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/5818138/British-Psychological-Society-Miss-Sophia-Shaw.html"&gt;a very odd correction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owing to an editing error, our report “Women who dress provocatively more likely to be raped, claim scientists” (June 23) wrongly stated that research presented at the recent BPS conference by Sophia Shaw found that women who drink alcohol are more likely to be raped. In fact, the research found the opposite. We apologise for our error.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Speaking from my own experience, I can say it’s bad enough to have a newspaper run a correction on an article of mine for a misspelled name or a figure with an extra zero tacked on the end. But turning around the result of a study to its precise opposite–that’s truly embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good that the &lt;em&gt;Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;posted a correction. It’s odd that it took three weeks for them to do so, though–especially since Goldacre nailed them in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/asking-for-it/"&gt;back on July 4&lt;/a&gt;, interviewing Sophie Shaw to show how wrong the article was. I have to agree with Goldacre that the correction, as stark as it is, actually only scratches the surface of all that was wrong with the story. At least, I think it does. I can’t actually read the original article on the Telegraph web site. As I blogged pre-swan-ride, the Telegraph had yanked the story, although they hadn’t yanked the title from its search engine results. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/telegraph-search-grab.jpg" title="telegraph-search-grab.jpg"&gt;(Screen grab)&lt;/a&gt; Now&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/search/?queryText=alleyne+rape&amp;amp;Search=Search"&gt; you can’t even find the title&lt;/a&gt;. So now the newspaper has published a correction to a story that, on the Internet at least, no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that newspapers should not follow this example if they want to thrive in the 21st century. Newspapers will have to find ways to distinguish themselves from other sources of information online. While they may have to set aside some of the traditional defining features (like ink), there are many things that will translate well into the future. One of them is a clear, reliable paper trail. But to preserve that trail, newspapers will have to resist the urge to hit the delete key.&lt;/p&gt;

I've also written a fair number of science pieces for publication, which get improved by good editors, which is also a good thing. But there are also ugly tales of bad editing and the difficult realities of getting science stories published, and I got one this morning that I post with the author's permission.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just read your post on journalist integrity, which reminded me to thank you again for your help with my article on zebrafish hair cells. I'm a recent graduate of an institutional science writing program and have been struggling to land freelance jobs as a science writer. My day job is in genetics research. One of my first real writing assignments was that article where I asked for your advice. Of course, I also interviewed the author of the study discussed in my piece. He corrected me when I asked if the inner ear in humans is similar to a fish's lateral line. When I submitted the article, just shy of the 800 words I was asked to write, the editor said that the published piece had to be shortened a little. A few weeks later I checked the publication and found my article reduced to 360 words. I wasn't happy, of course, but every journalist has dealt with this. However, when I began to read the piece I didn't recognize it as anything I had written. I became worried so I did a sentence by sentence comparison. To my complete horror, out of 360 words there was only one sentence in the published piece and 3 or 4 fragments of sentences I had actually written; and the article was published with my name on it! I cannot in good faith use this article in my portfolio. Even more distressing, there in the published piece was the incorrect statement about likening the inner ear in humans to the lateral line in fish. The editor wrote it in without checking with me. Removed was any mention of neuromasts. The researcher I interviewed and I are colleagues, so what will he think when he reads this piece? I'm new at this, so whatever credibility I might have had is now lost. I don't want to burn bridges with the editor since this is all I have going for me, but I need my name removed from that article. The entire thing should be withdrawn. It's inaccurate and unethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've heard a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of stories like this. I&amp;#39;ve also talked to a fair number of science students who want to do science journalism, and they are typically idealistic and want to do right by the science…but what&amp;#39;s the point when media priorities are all focused on short-term profit, and when the management can willfully mangle your story?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/a_tale_from_the_trenches_of_sc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/ECCJY56j6Dg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247237568650"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1570">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/94ac66576830662b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">Clash of Civilizations</title><published>2009-07-10T14:50:33Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T14:50:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1570" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In some alternative history, according to the webcomic &lt;a href="http://www.tragi-comix.com/tbp/"&gt;Teaching Baby Paranoia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper presented to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, Dr. David Greening, an Australian infertility expert, reports that 81 percent of the men in his study significantly improved their sperm quality, as measured by DNA fragmentation, through a simple one-week program.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The program was so easy that even the average guy could follow it. According to a summary of the study, "The men were instructed to ejaculate daily."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He presents it as a conflict for religious organizations like the Catholic church, which frown on masturbation. Unfortunately, Saletan gets it wrong. The Catholic Church can still condemn masturbation as sinful and urge their followers to procreate madly because there's nothing in their doctrine to favor &lt;i&gt;quality&lt;/i&gt; reproduction. To the simple-minded, human beings are all &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory"&gt;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;-selected&lt;/a&gt;. Pop 'em out and let God sort 'em out should be their motto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/this_is_not_a_dilemma_for_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/NTe2Bn26sVA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247235905963"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14823">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d6c48fafffda109</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="quote"/><category term="Sports"/><title type="html">At Least the French Are Honest</title><published>2009-07-10T14:11:10Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T14:11:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/at-least-the-french-are-honest/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">After winning a stage of the Tour de France, Frenchman &lt;strong&gt;Thomas

I fly. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. And sometimes I think I could give the safety announcements at the start of the flight better than most of the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I ever fly on Air New Zealand, well, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-Mq9HAE62Y"&gt;I’ll be paying closer attention&lt;/a&gt; (the video is safe for work, unless you work at United Airlines). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to individually thank Katherine Yoshida who set up the trials for her many tireless hours working with photos. I’m appreciative to Tobias Overath for his patience in the MRI and Christine Boylan for her head curviture assessments. Also, I’m grateful to Jeff Walker for running each trial and Discover’s own Amos Zeeberg and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/"&gt;Eliza Strickland&lt;/a&gt; for willing to be my guinea pigs and braving the MEG machine. Most importantly, very special thanks to Gregory Cogan for being a terrific host and David Poeppel (&lt;em&gt;brief bio &lt;a href="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/bios.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) for allowing me to take over his lab for such a stimulating cognitive neuroscience experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re already seeing some very interesting results which I’ll have plenty to say about here and in the book.  For more on David’s research, you can check out his terrific blog called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://talkingbrains.blogspot.com/2009/01/seeking-research-assistantlab-manager.html"&gt;Talking Brains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Built into the streets of New York City is a solar calendar on a truly massive scale. Every year around July 12th, New Yorkers are treated to a spectacular phenomenon as the setting sun aligns directly with the east-west streets of Manhattan's main grid, turning them into canyons filled with golden light. The effect is known as Manhattanhenge in reference to the much older stone monument near Salisbury. The term was coined in 2002 by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the charismatic director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonbell/"&gt;&lt;img alt="manhattanhenge.png" src="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/manhattanhenge.png" width="330" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The affected streets in the centre of Manhattan were laid down according to the Commissioner's Plan of 1811, which stipulated a grid offset of 28.9 degrees from true east-west. As a result, the low sun aligns with the streets twice for each solstice. On May 28th and July 12th, diplomats standing at street level outside the United Nations Headquarters will be able to watch the sun set at the other end of 42nd St, clear across Manhattan. In winter the effect is reversed, and on December 5th and January 8th, dawn commuters can see the sunrise framed by the skyscrapers of New York City.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://timesonline.typepad.com/science/2009/07/the-worlds-largest-solar-calendar.html#more"&gt;Continue reading&lt;/a&gt; at Science Central, and if you can't be in NYC personally, console yourself with these &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=manhattanhenge"&gt;incredible images&lt;/a&gt; on Flickr.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://scienceblogs.com/sciencepunk/2009/07/manhattan_streets_and_sun_alig.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author><name>SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247233622839"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/friday_cephalopod_the_great_an.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5042d78e50799b81</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: The Great and Serene Floating Brain</title><published>2009-07-10T14:27:35Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T14:27:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/jgcetIe36zQ/friday_cephalopod_the_great_an.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/friday_cephalopod_the_great_an.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/friday_cephalopod_the_great_an/sepiadarium_austrinum.jpeg" width="400" height="627" alt="sepiadarium_austrinum.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sepiadarium austrinum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Richard,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s great you’re doing an advice column for us skeptics.  My question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife’s office has become a maternity ward.  Of the 10 eligible women, 5 are pregnant.  In the last couple of weeks, they have begun passing books around and talking about their plans for their newborns.  Unfortunately, one of the books they are reading is by the leader of the pro-disease movement Jenny McCarthy. These are all smart, educated women, but the fear mongering of McCarthy has them second guessing the need for vaccinations.  Whenever I’m in the office, I hope to start up a conversation about vaccines, but with no luck so far.  I asked my wife permission to write an open letter, but she asked me not to.   I value the friendship they have with us, and don’t want to alienate them. How can I, or should I, start a conversation about vaccines with these ladies? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sick About Vaccines
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Sick,  &lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s often a delicate matter to intervene and correct the erroneous ideas of  indirect friends, (friends of a close friend or a spouse) because the indirect, second-stage relationship you have with them increases the likelihood that they will see it as an intrusion, and take the attitude, “Who the hell are you? Mind your own business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your wife’s reluctance to have either herself or you educate them with an unsolicited opinion may be about the complexities of office politics as well as the intricacies of  friendships.  She has to be their co-worker as well as their friend, and such dual roles often have conflicts of purpose.  I know that you are concerned for the health of the babies, but at the same time that is the mothers’ final responsibility, and your wife’s comfort and standing in the office is an important factor that you should take seriously, which I’m sure you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the precedent has already been established in the office about sharing prenatal and child care books, perhaps there is a book or some kind of literature written in lay terms that refutes McCarthy’s ideas, one that your wife could &lt;em&gt;casually&lt;/em&gt; offer to them, suggesting that knowing both sides of the issue is a good idea.   Since they are smart and educated women, this approach might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way would be to discretely leave that material somewhere in the office for the mothers to find.  I don’t really recommend this, because such backdoor tactics often backfire. &lt;b&gt;Definitely do not&lt;/b&gt; do anything without your wife’s agreement.  Your relationship with her and your respect for her situation should take precedence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&lt;/p&gt;

I also tried to make the case that accuracy and an interesting narrative aren&amp;#39;t mutually incompatible — and I should have added that accuracy ought to be the number one priority for science journalists, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you're wondering why so many scientists are distrustful of science journalists, you should take a look at this &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/07/asking-for-it/"&gt;account from Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;. A masters student in psychology gave a talk at a science conference to present her preliminary findings, which, sad to say, were picked up by the &lt;i&gt;Telegraph&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the title of the &lt;i&gt;Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Women who dress provocatively more likely to be raped, claim scientists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Women who drink alcohol, wear short skirts and are outgoing are more likely to be raped, claim scientists at the University of Leicester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the actual title of the press release from the University of Leicester describing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promiscuous men more likely to rape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a significant discrepancy in emphasis, yes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldacre called up the student researcher, and got the straight story: the &lt;i&gt;Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; title is factually &lt;b&gt;wrong&lt;/b&gt;, they found no statistically significant result corresponding to that claim. And here's the reaction of the investigator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I saw the article my heart completely sank, and it made me really angry, given how sensitive this subject is. To be making claims like the Telegraph did, in my name, places all the blame on women, which is not what we were doing at all. I just felt really angry about how wrong they'd got this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think science journalism is valuable and important, and in order to earn the trust of both scientists and the public, it needs to make honest, accurate reporting its chief value. Lately, there have been too many instances of a violation of that trust — and bending a story to more comfortably fit a common and erroneous stereotype is a perfect example of bad reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It probably does produce more contented readers, though. Or at least, in this case, contented &lt;i&gt;male&lt;/i&gt; readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/one_rotten_apple.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/q-MAF72EGkk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247227328348"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/10/eugenie-scott-powerfully-makes-the-case-for-science-religion-compatibility/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/db8fd59c46c84b5a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Religion"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">Eugenie Scott Powerfully Makes the Case for Science-Religion Compatibility</title><published>2009-07-10T11:02:37Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T11:02:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/10/eugenie-scott-powerfully-makes-the-case-for-science-religion-compatibility/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Her view is pretty much exactly the same as ours.

Blogging has been very hard for me lately.  I love writing, but due to work and family mishegos it's been hard to keep up with the posting.  I'm hoping a stint up in the woods providing medical supervision to 400 souls will be rejuvenating.  While I'm gone, I'll leave you with some of my favorite posts about the human side of medicine.  I hope you enjoy reading them again, or for the first time.  --PalMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/urinary-tract-infection/DS00286"&gt;Urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt; (UTIs) are a very common problem, especially in women. The link provided offers some very good information, but briefly, women's urethrae (the tube the urine comes out of), are closer to the rectum than those of men (who have a built-in "spacer"). This allows bacteria from the colon to creep over to the urinary tract and cause burning, pelvic pain, frequent urination, etc. I treat UTIs daily. Most are uncomplicated, but some are quite serious (usually in the elderly and chronically ill). As medical problems go, I love UTIs. When a healthy, young woman comes in with the usual symptoms, a quick test can confirm the diagnosis, and, usually, three days of inexpensive antibiotics fixes it. The patient is happy, I'm happy, everyone's happy. But then there's the orange stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years back, a medication called "phenazopyridine" became more widely available as an over-the-counter drug. It is marketed to treat the symptoms of UTIs.  It turns urine and other body fluids bright orange.  This medication&lt;i&gt; is&lt;/i&gt; useful for reducing the &lt;i&gt;symptoms&lt;/i&gt; of UTIs, but does not cure them. &lt;a href="http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/14mar20010800/edocket.access.gpo.gov/2003/03-32102.htm"&gt;The FDA &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; mandate certain labeling for the OTC preparations&lt;/a&gt;, but I can tell you from experience, the subtlety of this distinction is, well, subtle.  Fortunately, you don't have to rely on my experience.  Someone bothered to &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1494847"&gt;study the question&lt;/a&gt;.  Most patients do not realize the difference between treating the symptoms and treating the disease.  This leads to delay of treatment, and the infection can become more serious.  To add insult to injury, phenazopyridine's orange pigment interferes with the most common tests we use to diagnose UTIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In discussions of medical ethics, the concepts of "paternalism" and "patient autonomy" are often thought of as being in opposition to each other.  It is sometimes in the name of autonomy that medications are made more easily available to patients by skipping the physician prescribing process.  (Also, over the counter meds are quite profitable). This can be very useful for medications such as ibuprofen, or Plan B (post-coital contraception), but any time you cut out the expert, certain risks accrue.  Paternalism isn't the opposite of autonomy.  The two work together.  Patients see me for my expertise.  They don't consult me about movies, art, or (thankfully) religion---just medicine.  They do this because I'm the one with the training.   Giving a patient knowledgeable advice is not paternalistic---it's what they came here for.  I don't paternalistically &lt;i&gt;command&lt;/i&gt; my patients to do anything.  I dole out advice, and they are free to follow it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orange urine not only removes the expert, it fools the patient.  It does not increase autonomy, it actually &lt;i&gt;decreases&lt;/i&gt; it by deceiving the patient, perhaps causing them to become more ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Glenn Beck, Michelle Bachmann, Rush Limbaugh, and others like the are seeking to destroy the United States by replacing citizenship with tribalism. I do not think most of them intend this consequence, but they are so intoxicated by their self-righteousness that they are blind to the deeper consequences of what they are accomplishing. Richard Poplawski's murderous rage is one result. Almost certainly there will be others just as bad. An awful lot depends on hoew many.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are taking us backwards in time, to tribalism, and our salvation may be that theirs is a very small tribe. Even so, they can do enormous damage. It has happened before. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The break up of Yugoslavia showed it is possible for divisive politicians to destroy a country. All they and their media allies needed to do was gradually convince people that their differences between one another were more important than their similarities. The rest followed.
 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tribalism has been the chief barrier to establishing viable democracies in many parts of the world. Most African countries' boundaries were drawn ignoring who lived there. As a result peoples who lived peaceably with one another were divided, and lumped with peoples with very different cultural and political identities. Chaos and dictatorship resulted. When boundaries respected tribal divisions, democracy succeeds. Botswana is a good example.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We see the same problem in Iraq today where Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds form three groups with little sense of mutual identity. What sense they once had as Iraqis has been eroded by ambitious politicians. Violence is down in Baghdad at least as much due to ethnic cleansing having separated whole peoples as to Bush's 'surge.'

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same took place in Yugoslavia, another country where divisions were deliberately exacerbated by ambitious politicians, with incredibly lethal results. There was little likelihood of this carnage until politicians with the aid of their media allies began convincing Yugoslavs that many of their fellow citizens were no good. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their American equivalents are the media stars and leading politicians among the "Christian" right and the culture warriors in geenral.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a tribal mentality, loyalty to one's tribe, not one's country is what counts. This can establish a viable country when it is homogenous, but the stage is set for trouble when it is not. When one group wins they seek to install permanent rule: one man, one vote, one time. Then the other group feels tyrannized over, and rebels. 

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Republicans and American conservatives are increasingly acting like tribes hostile to the rest of us, not citizens. Never in the lifetime of anyone now living have the losers of an American election done so much to discredit the electoral process, deliberately prevent government from working, and encourage a wide ranging sense of crisis and danger among their followers as have the modern Republican Party and its allies. Never.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utter nutjobs like Michele Bachmann, Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, and others have done their level best to instill panic fear and rage among those stupid enough to believe them. And yes, 'stupid' is the right word. Bachmann calls for revolution. Beck says we are headed to either communism or fascism , depending on the day he speaks. Then, when the weakest minds among their audience lash out lethally, they claim innocence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name>Liz</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/rss.xml</id><title type="html">I Speak of Dreams</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247216884172"><id gr:original-id="http://skepticblog.org/?p=3339">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40b07dcd087b7508</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="comedy"/><category term="holistic"/><category term="homeopathy"/><category term="medicine"/><title type="html">Is Homeopathy So Bad?</title><published>2009-07-10T09:00:55Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T09:00:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepticblog.org/2009/07/10/is-homeopathy-so-bad/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.skepticblog.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This video is a brilliant piss-take on holistic healing.

Each of the slots advertises an ever-growing jackpot, which had edged up near $1,300,000 last time I checked. But we are not interested in slots. We are interested in the bar. By 3:30 on Tuesday afternoon, a small band of early-bird skeptics led by a large and improbably cuddly Danish Viking named Toby had colonized one of the Del Mar’s central tables.

Well for someone who just wrote a book advocating for better communication and less antagonistic discourse in science, Mooney is a failure when it comes to practicing what he preaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded of Randy Olsen’s hypocritical rants on the Skepticality podcast where he, like Mooney, argued that scientists make bad communicators and touted himself as a great expert in communicating science because he’s not antagonistic, etc, etc. But for such a great communicator advocating against antagonizing the people he’s is trying to persuade, he failed to persuade me and I’m sure failed to persuade the scientists he was trying to convince &lt;strong&gt;mainly&lt;/strong&gt; because he was every bit as antagonistic towards us and our position as he accused us of being. And he, like Mooney, made it all about him. All this talk about “framing” (which for the record, I don’t 100% disagree with) and creating a narrative, but in that narrative Olsen and Mooney try to cast themselves as the saviors and those who happen to disagree as “militants.” And then they innocently shake their heads like they can’t understand why their opponents disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’ve heard from many great skeptical minds who criticized Mooney in the past, I still mostly liked him. I read his blog on a regular basis, and when this one issue wasn’t the sole focus, I thought he had a lot of great stuff on his blog. Now he’s begun to behave like a crank by projecting what seems to be his own dogmatism onto those he disagrees with. I recognize that Mooney’s done a lot of good for the promotion of science but now his recent childish behavior has soured me on him significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/09/classic-quote-from-pzs-blog-vs-classic-quote-from-realclimate/"&gt;Mooney has written a blog&lt;/a&gt; purely to criticize PZ Myers for one particular &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_and_those.php"&gt;quote not from Myers but merely left by a commenter on Myers’ site&lt;/a&gt;, which Mooney called a “classic quote from PZ’s blog,” misleading readers to believe it came from Myers himself when it hadn’t. Now I’m going to give Mooney the benefit of the doubt (one more time) and just assume that this was just a grevious error on his part and not a diliberate attempt to misrepresent PZ Myers’ position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes off as incredibly childish and possibly vindictive of Mooney after receiving a bad review from Myers who is allegedly specifically singled out in Mooney’s book as being what’s wrong with the public understanding of science. And after being sent a review copy of the book, Myers pretty much left the personal criticisms alone and focused on his legitimate criticisms of the conclusions in the book. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/08/pz-myers-review-of-ua/"&gt;Mooney then just basically told people to ignore what Myers says because Myers is just a bitter “New Atheist” &lt;/a&gt;who couldn’t take being personally singled out as the problem in the book. But if Mooney was just going to dodge Myers’ substantive arguments anyway with a simple, “he’s just a dogmatic militant atheist” gambit, why bother sending a review copy of the book to Myers in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew Mooney’s position on this issue before but could easily overlook it as a small disagreement. Now, I can no longer do that. I’m sure I’ll continue to read his blog, but now I feel like when I do, there’s just going to be a bitter taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I guarantee you that Mooney does not want himself judged by quotes from the commenters on his blog, which are mostly far more childish and asinine than what you’ll find in the comments section of Myers’ blog, particular if you pull any given quote by John Kwok, a very regular commenter  on Mooney’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;

Just &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stress_this_is_not_exactly_news"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; I posted on an ongoing study about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/stress_this_is_not_exactly_news"&gt;stress in the mothers&lt;/a&gt; of autistic children being done by researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under psychologist &lt;a href="http://www.waisman.wisc.edu/faculty/mseltzer.html"&gt;Marshal Seltzner&lt;/a&gt;. Another &lt;a href="http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/4/375"&gt;study on stress in mothers&lt;/a&gt; of autistic children (we have more stress according to the study---findings I am not exactly surprised at) has been published in the most recent issue of the journal &lt;a href="http://aut.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/4/375"&gt;Autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Washington under &lt;a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwautism/about/research_staff.html"&gt;Annette Estes&lt;/a&gt;, associate director of the &lt;a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwautism/"&gt;University of Washington Autism Center&lt;/a&gt;, had 73 mothers fill out detailed surveys which measured: parenting stress, psychological distress, problem behaviors and adaptive functioning level (daily living skills). 51 of the children were on the autism spectrum and 22 had developmental delays. Most of the children were under 3 1/2 years old, male, and white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estes (in a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090708153233.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt; post) noted that it was "psychological stress" and not psychiatric disorders that was tested and I'm glad for that distinction. While it's possible that women with a history of psychiatric disorders might be more prone to stress, it would be inaccurate, and potentially misleading, to make any kind of connection between mothers of autistic children. Regretfully, such a connection was quite readily made by the likes of &lt;a href="http://unstrange.com/bettelheim.html"&gt;Bruno Bettelheim&lt;/a&gt; and others in a previous generation, and this is certainly one reason that there's more than some wariness in approaching the topic of stress in parents (and mothers in particular) in autistic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the University of Washington study, which suggests that parenting an autistic child is more stressful than parenting than a child who is not disabled: I suspect that most parents, and most mothers, of children on all parts of the spectrum, would answer in the affirmative. My son has been doing well but that's because my husband Jim and I have put 100%+ of our energy, thinking power, financial resources, and I don't know what else into him. Charlie's 12 and looks older than he is because of his height and build. But his needs are not those of a "typical" 12-year-old: He needs someone with him all the time; at school, he needs one-to-one teaching. He's able to do more and more, understands more and more, but will need support and care from us and others throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's taking the big picture. One other thing about life with Charlie is that we sweat the small stuff more than we might.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've not teaching summer school and don't have as many administrative duties as I used to at my job, and have been home more. Thursday I had to go into work early to help register the incoming new students. I took an early train and, though I was trying to sneak around to get ready to go, Charlie woke up. And, as Jim told me, stayed up, running around excitedly and then frenetically. Jim attempted a ride in the car and Charlie ate half the contents of his lunchbox as they drove around and told Jim "no school." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the call about all of this just as I was standing up to deboard a train packed with commuters in Hoboken. As I relayed instructions about making an impromptu visual schedule to get Charlie through the time till 8.40am when the bus was due to appear, many of those commuters did the averted gaze thing or stepped a few inches back. My phone lost the connection as I stepped into the entryway to get off the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Jim called to tell me Charlie had gotten on the bus fine, I spent the rest of the day feeling uneasy,. Some pervasive worry  just took root, all through riding the PATH train, walking down Kennedy Boulevard, sitting down at a computer terminal in the Roy Irving Theater at my college, registering new students for fall semester classes, walking back down Kennedy Boulevard and taking the PATH train and then NJ Transit again, greeting Jim and Charlie at home and heading about Charlie's day at school and watching YouTube videos with Charlie, eating dinner at a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diner_date"&gt;diner&lt;/a&gt;, seeing Jim and Charlie off on their second bike ride. Only after they'd left on their bikes and I had turned on some music did I realize, I didn't feel stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's our only child so I don't know a "typical" child would have exactly responded to this change in the routine this morning. Maybe he would have just gotten upset for a brief period and been fine, end of story. I don't think that I would have spent the whole day with a gnawing feeling of worry---small things can set off "fireworks" for Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a friend pointed out on a previous post on stress in mothers, life is even &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/low_cortisol_levels_stress_and_waking_up"&gt;more stressful&lt;/a&gt; for my son, Charlie. Charlie has far fewer ways of alleviating stress---indeed, some part of his education is about teaching him ways to self-calm and communicate his often overweening anxiety---and I've got plenty of ways to lessen mine, from talking to Jim and family and friends to writing (this post included).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247211169940"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/72fa16dc35514569</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Senior Death Warrants</title><published>2009-07-10T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/medical/seniordeath.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Message warns that health care reform will be a "death warrant" for seniors.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247210561736"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=2571">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d11ee2ab91c83dd2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Federal mental health insurance parity</title><published>2009-07-10T04:51:20Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T04:51:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/c1LVKblRXY4/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Sullivan</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247209514735"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=3752">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8c4512470cb23584</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alternative Medicine"/><category term="News From Around The Blogosphere"/><category term="Pareidolia"/><category term="Alejandro Junger"/><category term="alternative fuel"/><category term="detox"/><category term="GOOP.com"/><category term="Gwyneth Paltrow"/><category term="Ireland"/><category term="urine"/><category term="Virgin Mary"/><title type="html">News From Around The Blogosphere 7.9.09</title><published>2009-07-10T06:33:37Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T06:33:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/09/news-from-around-the-blogosphere-7-9-09/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I’m coming on the first birthday of Skepacabra in about 10 days (has it been a year already?), I thought maybe it’d be nice to go old-school Skepacabra and do a “News From Around The Blogosphere” entry like I used too. Also, it saves me a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/freshliving/gwyneth_600.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.beliefnet.com/freshliving/gwyneth_600.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="216"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/07/cleanse-your-inner-paltrow.html"&gt;Why does anyone take health advice from Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/a&gt;? Though Paltrow’s “lifestyle” site GOOP.com has been around for awhile, Amateur Scientist did a great little blog about it and her promotion of special the “detox” diet from “detox specialist” Dr. Alejandro Junger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why am I putting “detox” in scare quotes? Because it doesn’t really mean anything. Anything you shove down your throat (or up your ass, for that matter) to cleanse toxins from your system does nothing for your health since your body isn’t full of toxins. Like the word “energy”, people with no critical thinking skills use the word “toxin” to mean whatever they want without providing anything like evidence to show what it even is. Regardless, Paltrow just knows she’s full of toxins, so she recently tried out Dr. Junger’s suggested diet of one solid meal a day sandwiched by two liquid ones. Now she says she lost some weight and feels “pure”. I know it seems miraculous that a diet of very little actual food might lead to weight loss, but this is really just science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Urine luck&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Ohio University may have found a cheap and abundant source of hydrogen to potentially fuel future hydrogen-powered cars. Yeah, it’s pee pee. Turns out the primary component of urine, urea, has four hydrogen atoms per molecule, as opposed to water’s two. Using a nickel-based electrode, the urea atoms can be easily broken apart with less voltage than it takes to split water. Which means that urine could be a less expensive and more abundant source of hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local parish priest Fr Willie Russell said on radio station Limerick Live 95FM yesterday that people should not worship the tree. “There’s nothing there . . . it’s just a tree . . . you can’t worship a tree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Limerick diocesan office said the “church’s response to phenomena of this type is one of great scepticism”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I’m glad they think so, because compared the U.S., Netherlands is practically a utopia in almost every measurable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and in another Fox “News” blunder, Bill O’Reilly is caught red-handed lying about &lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/fox-their-friends-the-reason-the-facebalm-was-invented/"&gt;a story I blogged about yesterday&lt;/a&gt; about the end of the unconstitutional tradition of military planes doing flyovers above religious festivals (just after the 1:40 mark):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/09/fox-news-calls-netherlands-militantly-secular/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/o5JrTpH7hxQ/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So according to O’Reilly, there is “no specific religion at play” whereas the director of the festival in question has said this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers don’t deny the explicitly Christian nature of the annual patriotic rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s about as Christian as you can get — we believe in promoting Christianity,” [Director Patti] Syme said. “And we have no plans to change that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…it’s about as Christian as you can get.” Hmm, last I checked, Christianity was a specific religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DOES THE PROPOSED PROJECT INVOLVE HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RESEARCH PLAN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SPECIFIC AIMS: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect on god-belief of human exposure to various hydrological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Canadian/American indie rock supergroup The New Atheists have been steadily producing books arguing that the god of the Christian bible (among other gods) doesn’t really exist.  Although the biological sciences seem to provide unambiguous support for this view, it is possible that &lt;s&gt;god willing&lt;/s&gt; some of the other sciences may countervail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRELIMINARY STUDIES:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Francis Collins (who is the &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-sci-collins9-2009jul09,0,7642590.story"&gt;new director&lt;/a&gt; of your agency, but please don’t let that sway your opinion) was &lt;a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20060815_sam_harris_language_ignorance/"&gt;hiking in the Cascades&lt;/a&gt;, when he came across a waterfall frozen into three streams.  As this reminded him of the Trinity, he fell on his knees in the dewy grass and devoted himself to Jesus Christ.  So far this experiment has never been replicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will collect a large assortment of scientists and randomly assign them to visit hydrological features, including aquifers, beaches, catadupae, drainage basins, endorheic basins, flood plains, infiltration basins, losing streams, percolation trenches, riparian zones, streams, and waterfalls.  (I, for instance, will be randomly assigned to the “beach” treatment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each scientist will be measured both before and after his trip using the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ews/2357294212/"&gt;Dawkins Scale of Religiosity&lt;/a&gt;, after which we will use some type of computer (which we will purchase with the grant money) to make graphs and &lt;s&gt;play Minesweeper&lt;/s&gt; draw conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of this first experiment, we will repeat on a larger scale, expanding the subject pool to include non-scientists, monkeys, kangaroos, and human embryonic stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I think we can get our work published in one of the &lt;a href="http://www.ivpress.com/about_us/"&gt;InterVarsity Press&lt;/a&gt; science journals.  We’d also present at some of the Campus Crusade science conferences, of course.  And we’d be happy to facilitate inclusion of our results in the science curriculum in &lt;a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/6514838.html"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OTHER FUNDING:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve also applied to the &lt;a href="http://yrif.org/2009/05/02/dont-know-much-biologos/"&gt;BioLogos Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for funding.  If you could put in a good word for us with Director &lt;a href="http://biologos.org/about/team/dr-francis-collins/"&gt;Collins&lt;/a&gt;, that would be just swell!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joel</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://yrif.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://yrif.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Your Religion Is False</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://yrif.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247205947532"><id gr:original-id="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/07/10/on-twitter-redux">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e2e25f2f31355e9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="twitter"/><title type="html">On Twitter, redux</title><published>2009-07-10T05:44:10Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T05:44:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/07/10/on-twitter-redux" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://blogs.nature.com/rpg/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I ran a brief and unscientific poll &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/rpg/blog/2009/07/03/on-friday"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, much to &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/ennis/blog"&gt;Cath’s&lt;/a&gt; chagrin. It wasn’t as bad as she would have you believe, because I actually did think about the questions in those couple of teeth-brushing minutes, and figured I could pull out some information: obviously a more sophisticated and less self-selecting poll would be more valuable, but we’re talking about &lt;em&gt;Twitter&lt;/em&gt; here, for goodness’ sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let’s have a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rg-d.com/nature/twitter.001.tiff" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Profession of Twitterers (or ‘Scientwists’)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the way the question was phrased, and the possibility of an ‘ex-bench scientist’ being also one of the other categories, I was not surprised to find that the numbers from the ‘professions’ category did not match the numbers in ‘disciplines’. However, it’s pretty obvious that of the ~80 respondents, about two thirds self-identified as research scientists. Not many medics—but quite a few people who have left scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rg-d.com/nature/twitter.002.tiff" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Self-discipline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always suspected that biologists were pretty web-savvy, even back in the dark days of Gopher and &lt;span&gt;NCSA&lt;/span&gt; Mosaic. More twitterers self-identified as ‘bioscience’ than all the other categories combined. These data should be interpreted with caution because those who saw the poll are probably more likely to be biological scientists anyway, simply because my two seed twitterers (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rpg7twit"&gt;rpg7twit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/f1000"&gt;f1000&lt;/a&gt;), and hence their followers, are biomedical. Perhaps this result is not, then, that surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://rg-d.com/nature/twitter.003.tiff" alt=""&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Professional&lt;/em&gt; vs &lt;em&gt;personal use&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result surprised me a little bit. It seems that most &lt;a href="http://www.twibes.com/group/scientists"&gt;scientwists&lt;/a&gt; mix and match business and pleasure. Only nine votes—a bit over 10%—claimed separate work/personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I get a round tuit, I’ll re-do this poll in a more sensible way, and get some non-squishies to seed it. Maybe I could present this at &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/soloconf"&gt;SoLoConf ’09&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation surrounding the refusal to testify by the Mt. Vernon Board of Education members has been clarified.  The &lt;a href="http://www.mountvernonnews.com/local/09/07/11/judge-explains-denial-in-freshwater-case" rel="external "&gt;Mt. Vernon News reports&lt;/a&gt; that according to the Common Pleas judge, the Board of Education quashed the subpoenas for testimony by Ian Watson and Jody Goetzman on the (official)  ground that they have no direct knowledge of the allegations made against Freshwater and could therefore only offer hearsay testimony.  Quashing the subpoenas basically takes them out of existence, so there were no subpoenas be complied with and so the judge didn’t order compliance with (now) non-existent subpoenas.  (I know, I know: I tried to write a cleaner sentence, but I’m tired.)  Further,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the matter is an administrative hearing, the judge said, the board has the legal authority to issue and quash subpoenas. He added that he has no grounds under law to overturn the board’s decision to invalidate the subpoenas in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R. Kelly Hamilton apparently called the Board Members because he is trying to make the case that there is a conspiracy against Freshwater in which some teachers, administrators, Board Members, and other unnamed people have been  trying to get get rid of him for years.  Don Matolyak, Freshwater’s pastor, &lt;a href="http://mobile.dispatch.com/articles/170029890" rel="external "&gt;made that allegation&lt;/a&gt; around the time the hearing began in October 2008:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Freshwater asked the Mount Vernon school board if he and other teachers could “critically examine” evolution in class. The school board said no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From that point on, John had a bull’s-eye on him,” said Don Matolyak, Freshwater’s pastor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The board has carried out a vendetta against Freshwater because he wanted to teach alternative views to evolution, and that offended school-board members who believe in evolution, Matolyak said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pam Schehl’s interview with the judge also clarified another matter that’s been hovering out there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way the law is structured, Freshwater has the right to appeal whatever decision the board makes regarding his contract termination. If Freshwater does appeal to the court of common pleas at that time, the judge may or may not require additional testimony not presented during the administrative hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this process may well not be completed within the reign of the current monarch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;===============&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of developments should be noted.  First, as you may recall, R. Kelly Hamilton, John Freshwater’s attorney, subpoenaed two members of the Mt. Vernon Board of Education, Ian Watson and Jody Goetzman.  They declined to testify, arguing that were they to testify they would have to recuse themselves from subsequently voting on the recommendation of the hearing referee, and that would leave the BoE short of a quorum and it would be unable to act on the recommendation.  Hamilton asked the Knox County Court of Common Pleas to compel their testimony, but yesterday the judge declined to do so on the ground that he does not have jurisdiction.  I don’t yet know what Hamilton will do next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Freshwater has recently &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/webfm_send/1107" rel="external "&gt;amended his federal complaint&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) that was filed June 9, 2009, to include &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;213. Plaintiffs incorporate the foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully restated herein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;214. At the time of Defendants actions Plaintiffs John and Nancy Freshwater were married and continue to be married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;215. As a result of the wrongful and negligent acts of the Defendants, Plaintiffs were caused to suffer, and will continue to suffer in the future, loss of consortium, loss of society, affection, assistance, and conjugal fellowship, all to the detriment of their marital relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the session scheduled for tomorrow, July 10, has been postponed.  The hearing is currently scheduled to resume July 24, but given the recent twitchiness of the schedule I’m not counting on it happening.  Hamilton may appeal the Common Pleas court decision, and I have no idea how long that might take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have those 50 pages of notes to transcribe on the two days of hearings in May.  I hope to get to that one of these days real soon now.  :)&lt;/p&gt;

Believe it or not, I'll even be on a panel later today! While I'm gone,  I'll probably manage to do a new post or two (or three), but, in the meantime, while I'm away communing with fellow skeptics at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2006.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Alright, I admit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went a little overboard with last week's edition of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_secrets_of_j_1.php"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;. This feature was intended to be a light-hearted look at whatever particular woo target that catches my fancy on a given week, as opposed to the more serious discussions of alternative medicine I like to do at other times. However, it's a fine line between believing in a bit of strange &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/02/what_is_an_altie_2006_edition.php"&gt;altie&lt;/a&gt; woo and possibly being a disturbed individual, and I fear that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/07/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_secrets_of_j_1.php"&gt;last week's targets&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/MY-HANDWRITTEN-JOURNAL-JESUS-CHRIST-APPEARED-TO-ME_W0QQitemZ200004365852QQihZ010QQcategoryZ16710QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem"&gt;guy who wanted to sell&lt;/a&gt; the secrets of Jesus on Ebay and &lt;a href="http://www.alexchiu.com/"&gt;Alex Chiu&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to have figured out how humans can be immortal, all using little magnetized devices one wears on the hands and feet) crossed that line. Maybe it was too much quantum entanglement of my neurons--homeopathically, of course--with those of that quantum homeopathic guru, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_its_no.php"&gt;Lionel Milgrom&lt;/a&gt;, whom I discussed very early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this week, I want to pull back from the abyss, where woo drifts into possible insanity, and move on to other topics. I had thought of commenting on "spiritual healer" Adam the Dreamhealer, but &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2006/07/adam_the_healer.html"&gt;Skeptico&lt;/a&gt; beat me to it in such a comprehensive fashion that I couldn't really think of anything new or amusing to add. In any case, I haven't yet recovered from my delving into the dizzying space of quantum homeopathy. Fortunately, I think I have just the thing to bring me back to earth: bowel cleansing. (If poop doesn't bring one back to earth after all that quantum woo and bizarre talk of immortality and Jesus bestowing His secrets upon us, I don't know what will.) Consider this phrase:&lt;/p&gt;

I am once again culling old posts for classic items to repost for you now and then this month.  I need a breather, and that is how I'm going to get it. Sadly, or alternatively, happily, two years ago in July we were in South Africa, so I've got nothing substantive from that time period.  But, in looking at &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; year ago, I found something &lt;em&gt;very interesting&lt;/em&gt;.  It turns out that July 2008 was a rather spectacular month, blogospherically.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 2008 was a turning point in the blogosphere, and July 2009 promises to be one as well.  One year ago, give or take a few weeks, several things happened.  Some of those things relate to events unfolding as we speak.  I'd like to review them for you and give you a warning of what might happen next. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/someone_has_been_wrong_on_the.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/someone_has_been_wrong_on_the.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/_EHFgk3rH1A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247195837310"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/accommodationists_and_new_athe.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e775c5eec2ee74ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Framing Science"/><title type="html">Accommodationists and New Atheists Sail in the Same Boat</title><published>2009-07-10T03:37:55Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T03:37:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/OaSKAfL202Q/accommodationists_and_new_athe.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/accommodationists_and_new_athe.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...

&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;strong&gt;Bill O’Reilly&lt;/strong&gt; talking about that festival tonight (beginning at the 1:38 mark):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/o5JrTpH7hxQ%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1%26start%3D98&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No specific religion at play” at that festival?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the &lt;a href="http://www.idahopress.com/news/?2009-07-03-Pentagon-nixes-flyover"&gt;director — the freaking &lt;em&gt;director&lt;/em&gt; — of the festival had to say&lt;/a&gt; last week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Organizers don’t deny the explicitly Christian nature of the annual patriotic rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s about as Christian as you can get — we believe in promoting Christianity,” [Director Patti] Syme said. “And we have no plans to change that.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah!  I caught him in a lie.  That was far too easy.  You should all try doing it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should *totally* write for &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Bishop &lt;strong&gt;John Shelby Spong&lt;/strong&gt; explains how Hell is completely fictional.  He adds that the church has a vested interest in not letting people grow up — “you can’t control grown-ups” — which is why they use the term “born-again.”  You’re still a “child” then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t seen him speak before, you’re in for a surprise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/SF6I5VSZVqc%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spong shouldn’t be let off the hook for his other beliefs, though.  He still believes in life after death and (presumably) Heaven, neither of which are based on any credible evidence.  But it’s refreshing to hear this point of view.  The only other time I’ve heard it is when I heard about &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2006/11/26/heretics/"&gt;pastor &lt;strong&gt;Carlton Pearson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if Spong doesn’t buy into Hell, what does that make him?  Can he still be considered a Christian?  How much theology can you shun and still be considered one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do Spong’s beliefs make you feel any different about Christianity?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you want to see more Christians thinking the same way or would it not make any difference to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Thanks to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://religiouscomics.net"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for the link!)&lt;br&gt;

When I work I use my dozen years of engineering education and  dozen or so years of engineering experience and creativity to assess a problem, develop strategies for a solution, and then implement that solution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In assessing a problem, I look at the physical symptoms of a problem, I collect tangible data about whatever I am studying, I push systems to they boundary conditions and examine performance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When determining one more more possible solutions for a problem I look at what other people have done and specifically what their results were. I may try a few things to see if parts of one solution or another might work. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I implement a solution I check to see if it worked under normal conditions, I check to see if operating conditions change that my solution is superior to the original implementation, or at least the same. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then I learn from my mistakes. If I designed something poorly the first time, I want to be sure I understood why it was poor so that I can avoid doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of these efforts require strong attention to physical, measurable results. It all requires that I don’t pretend something will just work because I want it to. It requires that I check to see if my assumptions are correct.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you this? Because I am continually amazed when I hear about superstitious engineers, particularly religious ones, and of those, particularly young earth, bible thumping ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other day, I was looking for a simple relay board that would switch 1 amp load when signaled from my tiny digital signals from my microcontroller. Pretty straight forward. I had a bunch of other requirements also. Well I found what I was looking for from &lt;a href="http://www.winfordeng.com/products/cat_rly.php"&gt;Winford Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. They make a bunch of boards that are good for prototyping designs, so I got a few of their relay boards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They work fine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I got a little present with my boards.  A little pamphlet, entitled “Facts to Face”. Hmm. I wonder what facts are so important that they would send it along with my order? What am I missing or so unknowledgeable about that someone at Winford felt that they must pass along this vital information. Global Warming? Crime Prevention? Suicide?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlabkMkwceI/AAAAAAAABHk/B610Jexswck/s1600-h/facts2%5B4%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px" title="facts2" border="0" alt="facts2" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/Slabk5GLJ3I/AAAAAAAABHo/-C1ljBrn4Rs/facts2_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="524" height="443"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well apparently the first fact is that I need to be saved.  This fact is quoted from some where called Romans. These guys, without knowing one thing about me presume I have sinned by some standard known only to them. Apparently I’m gonna die from this sin disease. Why can’t they just write in readable English?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second fact is that I can’t save myself! What? I can help myself, and when I can’t I have friends and profressionsals that can… but not from this mysterious sin that they tell me about. Oh Noes!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlablZQjgEI/AAAAAAAABHs/t1z1hrdDjJ4/s1600-h/facts3%5B3%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px" title="facts3" border="0" alt="facts3" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlabmIXkmRI/AAAAAAAABHw/_nkAZw2l5Yk/facts3_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="504" height="435"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;God’s Son died to save me? Wait, I thought he was resurrected. So he didn’t really die did he? So this dude has been alive floating around for two thousand years and I am supposed to feel bad that he spent a few days strung up. Hey, tell you what, show me modern evidence that I can live forever and I will also happily be strung up to a cross for 3 measly days. Not really much of a sacrifice is it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next fact is that God apparently shows me how to be saved. Looks like if I want eternal life, then all I have to do is…you know.. be gods son. I mean really, has anyone actually visited this heaven place? How do we know there isn’t just one person there. Someone send me a photo!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/Slabm8i3dKI/AAAAAAAABH0/m8c7WkuzNuA/s1600-h/facts4%5B3%5D.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;display:inline;border-top:0px;border-right:0px" title="facts4" border="0" alt="facts4" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_HVPOreIAZ20/SlabnQ9DhBI/AAAAAAAABH4/WNbLFuNaM4U/facts4_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="509" height="427"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next fact that I need to hear about is that if I believe in god, he will forgive my nonexistent sins. Whew! that is good to know! But look at that! I can do all things through Christ! That's weird, I don;t even know what that means. Can I do some things through horse? Seems to me that I can do all things through work and learning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fact #6 tells me that Christian should be working for God. I would like to know how much God pays per hour. I mean with no actual guarantee that he is there, seems to me that I’d like something tangible now. Good thing I am not a Christian, I guess I am free form this work paid by IOUs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got a giggle that they sent this to me. I was at a loss to understand why they would send this out. So I asked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Is it a company policy to send along religious paraphernalia with     &lt;br&gt;shipments or is someone in your shipping department doing this for you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got a response pretty quickly&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yes, this is our company policy. The three owners of the company     &lt;br&gt;(myself being one) all believe the Bible is true, and God's Word, and we      &lt;br&gt;hope our customers will take a minute to evaluate the claims of the      &lt;br&gt;Bible. So, it is our policy to include this in the first order we send      &lt;br&gt;to each of our customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I will never order from them again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its not that they are religious. I don’t care what they do on their own time. Who am I to comment on their shared delusion? No, I won’t order from them for two reasons: I find it insulting for them to tell me, by way of a dumb pamphlet, that they think I am one way or another without knowing me. The presumption!  But more importantly, I won’t order from them because they have clearly demonstrated that they are willing to make extremely important decisions about themselves, about their lives and about other people based on nothing other than some dumb book and the cultish blathering of those who follow it. If I need to return something will they tell me that God told them not to take it? If I need them to fix something will they pray for it to get better?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don’t really care that they sent this pamphlet. I just think its a dumb business practice. It won’t convert anyone, and people who already believe that nonsense already have a bible. They are just wasting money, and doing nothing. Its not like relay boards are that hard to find (or make).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/26613182-4208547181780849290?l=techskeptic.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Techskeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Effort Sisyphus</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247189397572"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/oooh_look_shiny.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ae2085adb2a891a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anthropology"/><title type="html">Oooh look...

One of the things I needed was water.  I know, I know, if I buy bottled water the earth will split in half and we will all die.  But you have not tasted the water that comes out of the tap at the cabin.  Anyway, I bought a couple of gallons, and then decided to buy a six pack of bottles, because we had four people going up in the car, two were kids who never drink enough water, and I thought this would be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/oooh_look_shiny.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/oooh_look_shiny.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~4/MefHMt18ENo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/index.xml</id><title type="html">Greg Laden&amp;#39;s Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247189397571"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/unscientific_america.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c5de100eb729f827</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Unscientific America</title><published>2009-07-10T01:00:30Z</published><updated>2009-07-10T01:00:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/Evc9nv1uyW4/unscientific_america.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/unscientific_america.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book note: I have received my copy of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465013058?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0465013058"&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens our Future&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwgregladenc-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0465013058" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt; by Chris Mooney and Sheril Kirshenbaum of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/"&gt;The Intersection&lt;/a&gt;, and am now reading it for review.

Today is my mother's birthday. Every year for the last many years it's a strange day for me. My mother died when I was teenage Isis and I have lived my adult life without her.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;As I have reached major milestones in my life (graduation with my bachelor's degree, my wedding day, the birth of Little Isis, my second graduation), I have keenly felt her absence. While I think of her daily, it is during those times that I have really mourned for her.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;But, then I remind myself that it is not actually &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; mother that I am mourning -- it's the absence of a mother in general. You see, as I wrote a month ago, my mother left our family when I in elementary school and our relationship devolved from there. And, as I wrote a month ago, I have lived a lot of my adult life trying not to be like my mother.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;[I'm chuckling aloud in the cafe in &lt;span&gt;MRU'&lt;/span&gt;s hospital as I write this, thinking of all the undergraduates and graduate students who commented that they read my blog. Those people that are more senior than you that you look up to? We're just as fucked up as you (if not more so).]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;My mother's birthday is a strange day for me. Part of it is morbidly strange. Try as I might to not let the thought cross my mind, I am less than ten years away from the age my mother was when she died. On her birthday I tend to find myself wondering if she knew with each passing year how little time she had left. I find myself wondering if she knew on the morning of her death that later in the evening she'd see our family dog hit by a car, take him to the vet, and then die on the exam room floor of the vet's office of a massive myocardial infarction. I find myself thinking that, if I end up as she did, I will never see Little Isis as a teenager, as a young adult, or as a man. I won't know his wife or my grandchildren.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;It's hard not to let my mind travel down the path of the macabre on her birthday. It's also hard to celebrate the life of a woman I still find myself angry with after all these years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;So, I've recently taken to thinking of my mother's birthday as more of an anniversary of my own motherhood. I allow myself the time for all of the screwed up things I need to think about, and then I mentally recommit myself to providing for Little Isis -- to making him and his happiness my priority and the reexamine the kind of mother I have been over the last year.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;My diagnosis isn't great, but it's not terminal. Sometimes I feel like I work too much, or I am too exhausted at the end of the day to really play with the intensity that he deserves, but he is also a brilliant and happy little boy. His teacher comments on occasion that he is too chatty at naptime, but he also has a wonderful vocabulary and I am proud of it. How many two year olds understand the word "chrysalis?" Little Isis still wakes up some nights crying and asking to come sleep next to me in the bed, but his affection for me also melts my heart and there is not better feeling than my snuggly baby against me. Sometimes I cop out and make macaroni and cheese instead of vegetables, but he's healthy and growing. I frequently worry and pray that he never understand financial insecurity, but he understands the concept of putting money in his piggy. That gives me hope that I haven't screwed him up too badly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Tonight when I put him to bed I'll silently reflect on the ways I may have failed him this year, but also promise to try to do better in the future. I know that I can't promise him that I'll always be there, but I think I can promise that I'll always try to be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;I am certain that I can promise to always love him.

I am not going to address his personal criticisms of me — there&amp;#39;s no point, you obviously know I think he&amp;#39;s completely wrong, and the uncharitable will simply claim my disagreement is the result of a personal animus — so instead I&amp;#39;m only going to address a couple of other general points that Mooney and Kirshenbaum get &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; wrong. They plainly do not understand the atheist position, and make claims that demonstrate that either they didn't read any of the "New Atheist's" books, or perhaps the simple ideas in them are too far beyond their comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic one, from philosophy of science 101. There are several different ways to derive a naturalistic position. Mooney and Kirshenbaum sort of get it right, although I disagree with some of the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern science relies on the systematic collection of data through observation and experimentation, the development of theories to organize and explain this evidence, and the use of professional institutions and norms such as peer review to subject claims to scrutiny and ultimately (it is hoped) develop reliable knowledge. A core principle underlying this approach is something called "methodological naturalism," which stipulates that scientific hypotheses are tested and explained solely by reference to natural causes and events. Crucially, methodological naturalism is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the same thing as philosophical naturalism—the idea that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of existence consists of natural causes and laws, period. Methodological naturalism in no way rules out the possibility of entities or causes outside of nature; it simply stipulates that they will not be considered within the framework of scientific inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, he proceeds to damn the "New Atheists" for "collapsing the distinction" between methodological and philosophical naturalism, and argues that Dawkins is taking a &lt;i&gt;philosophical&lt;/i&gt; position and misusing science to claim it "entirely precludes God's existence."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One big problem: we don't. Oddly enough, this is one of the most common canards used by theistic critics, that we're demanding a kind of philosophical absolutism, yet Mooney is an atheist. The "New Atheist" approach is firmly grounded in &lt;i&gt;methodological&lt;/i&gt; naturalism; it's an extremely pragmatic operational approach to epistemology that leads us to reject religious claims. None of us make an absolute declaration of the impossibility of the existence of a deity, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One strand of this view is simple empiricism. Science and reason give us antibiotics, microwave ovens, sanitation, lasers, and rocketships to the moon. What has religion done for us lately? We have become accustomed to objective measures of success, where we can explicitly &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; that a particular strategy for decision-making and the generation of knowledge has concrete results. I'm sorry, but faith seems to produce mainly wrong answers, and in comparison, it flops badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, now, I can hear the defenders of religion begin to grumble, there&amp;#39;s more to life than merely material products like microwave ovens — there&amp;#39;s contentment and contemplation and a sort of subjective psychology of ritual and community and all that sort of thing. Sure. Fine. Then stick to it, and stop pretending that religion ought to be a determinant of public policy, that it can inform us about the nature of our existence, or that it provides a good guide to public morality. Get it out of our schools and courthouses and workplaces and governments, take it to your homes and your churches, and use it appropriately as your personal consoling mind-game. And stop pretending that it is universal and necessary, because there are a thousand different religions that all claim the same properties with wildly different details, and there are millions of us with no religion at all who get along just fine without your hallowed quirks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other strand is reciprocity. We atheists and scientists have ideas that we are expected to explain and support with evidence, and we are accustomed to being jumped on with sadistic vigor if we fail to provide it. We merely apply the same methodological standards to religion. We do not insist &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; that gods cannot exist, we instead turn to all those people who insist that they do, and ask, "how do you know that?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you believe that for all the fervor of their certainty, &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of them have ever adequately answered the question?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no philosophical or metaphysical certainty on the part of us "New Atheists", and we have no problem admitting it. Dawkins wrote it down forthrightly in his book when he scores himself as a 6 on a 7-point scale of atheism: "6. Very low probability, but short of zero. De facto atheist. 'I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not 
there.'" It's genuinely remarkable how many people say they've read his book, and then walk away to claim that Dawkins says science "entirely precludes God's existence."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree entirely with Dawkins' sentiment. I also turn it around to use an agnostic sentiment on religious interlocuters: "I don't know for sure, &lt;i&gt;and you don't either&lt;/i&gt;, so why are you being so high-handedly specific in your claims that god was a Jewish carpenter, or his prophet was a polygamist with a flying horse, or that Ragnarok is imminent? Give me a method for evaluating your claims, tell me what rational reason you have to believe that, show me the evidence!" And then they don't. I'm just supposed to have faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t even have to be some weirdly specific, quirky bit of historical fiction — even the vague claims fail on epistemological grounds. How often have you been told that &amp;quot;God is love&amp;quot;? &lt;i&gt;How do they know?&lt;/i&gt; What does it even mean? It&amp;#39;s just feel-good babble. If it makes you feel good to think it, go ahead…but please, let&amp;#39;s not have this standard of unsubstantiated wishful thinking be regarded as a useful contribution to philosophy, or science, or morality, or poetry, or social cohesiveness, or much of anything other than a trivial activity, like the twiddling of your thumbs that you do in idle moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now notice: Mooney and Kirshenbaum are busily carping at these ghastly &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot; for imagined transgressions against reason and the appropriate application of science, but what do they have to say about Christians who believe that crackers turn into Jesus in their mouths, or that a magical ensoulment occurs at fertilization to turn a zygote into a fully human being, or that children should be kept in ignorance about sex, or that woman&amp;#39;s role is as subservient breeder, or that using condoms to prevent disease is a violation of a divine dictate that the only purpose of sex is to have babies, or that people who love other people of the same sex deserve stoning, or at least to be unable to share insurance policies? Compared to the &amp;quot;New Atheist&amp;quot; insistence that remarkable claims about magic sky fairies ought to be regarded as patent nonsense, those can be rather destructive to society…and also negatively affect the acceptance of science. Rick Warren surely deserves as much condemnation as Richard Dawkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no. The book is silent on the people who directly oppose science politically, culturally, in our classrooms, and on our radio and television. They aren't the problem, I guess. If only we could clear away the distracting Atheist Noise Machine, train a generation of science journalists to stop bashing religion (as if they do &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;), and presto, the populace will obligingly stop shaking their angry fists at science and will lie back and accept that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, that the climate is changing and we need to take political action, and oh my yes, gay people can have their civil rights, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait, I'm over-generalizing. They do say something about those people who believe in talking snakes, angels, and the power of mystic mumblings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American scientific community gains nothing from the condescending rhetoric of the New Atheists—and neither does the stature of science in our culture. We should instead adopt a stance of respect towards those who would hold their faith dear, and a sense of humility based on the knowledge that although science can explain a great deal about the way our world functions, the question of God&amp;#39;s existence lies outside its expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Respect&lt;/i&gt; faith. Be &lt;i&gt;humble&lt;/i&gt;. Pretend that all those beliefs are unquestionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bull…oh, excuse me. Mooney gets rather pearl-clutchey when strong language is used. I shall restrain myself (and you commenters, too, please: I normally trust you all to cope with adult language without too much concern, but apparently a couple of authors with very delicate sensitivities will be reading this and counting your four-letter words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look, the only reason "the question of God's existence" is in any way outside the domain of science is because it is such an amorphous subject that the believers will &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; rapidly move its definition beyond testability when pressed. However, they also claim that these deities had major material effects on the world — and most also claim ongoing, direct participation by their favorite god on their personal universe. Those are not beyond the realm of science! If absolute knowledge of this superbeing&amp;#39;s existence is out of our reach, we can at least easily push him/her/it/them back into a fairly tenuous connection with the world, to the point where they are irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if science can't say a thing about the existence of gods, sweet jebus, Mooney, be consistent and admit that the jabbering, sanctimonious priests can't either! Why we should respect their fairy-tales and complete lack of humility while you castigate godless science for relying on mere evidence is incomprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The essence of what Mooney and Kirshenbaum recommend in their book is that science must cut off its own balls, science must wear her corset cinched tight, science must not dissent from the masses, science must be obliging and polite, because that is the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; way the public will accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rudely disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is nothing condescending about appreciating that almost every human being, even the most god-soaked, has a functional mind and that maybe they can actually &lt;i&gt;learn&lt;/i&gt; about science and a scientific way of thinking that makes their myths untenable. There is nothing condescending about being uncompromising in our expectations and trusting that others can hear and think and express their own ideas. There &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; something deeply condescending about setting aside a big chunk of people's experience and telling people that they should not  question it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is a sublimely human activity and a central part of the best of Western culture…and of every culture on earth that aspires to be something more than a collection of dirt-grubbing subsistence breeders, propagating for the sake of propagating. It&amp;#39;s what gives us the potential to reach beyond making do, that gives us the leisure and freedom to flower in the arts and explore the diversity of human experience. Even institutionalized religion itself is an incidental byproduct of the first clever dicks who thought to reroute the flow of a river to irrigate fields and led to centralization, urbanization, hierarchies of leadership, accounting, writing, and the whole avalanche of change that followed. It&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;important&lt;/i&gt;. Mooney and Kirshenbaum know this; it's what their whole book is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be what it is, though, science must live. It's a process carried out by human beings, and it can't be gagged and enslaved and shackled to a narrow goal, one that doesn't rock the boat. Imagine they'd written a book that tried to tell artists that they shouldn't challenge the culture; we'd laugh ourselves sick and tell them that they were completely missing the point. Why do you think some of us are rolling our eyes at their absurd request that scientists should obliging accommodate themselves to a safe frame that every middle-class American would find cozy? &lt;i&gt;They don't get it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, they think that Carl Sagan's great magic trick was that he didn't make Americans feel uncomfortable. I think they're wrong. Sagan's great talent was that he showed a &lt;b&gt;passion for science&lt;/b&gt;. People made fun of his talk of &amp;quot;billyuns and billyuns&amp;quot;, but it was affectionate, because at the same time he was talking about these strange, abstract, cosmic phenomena, everyone could tell he was sincere — he loved this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example: Feynman. Watch the man, and what is the impression he makes? Absolute joy. He's &lt;i&gt;laughing&lt;/i&gt; at the universe. People love his lectures because he's cocky and bold and doesn't hesitate to show you where you're wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a less openly abrasive case, how about E.O. Wilson? In his talks, he seems to be a soft-spoken gentleman who&amp;#39;s willing to concede quite a bit of respect to everyone — but read his work, and there&amp;#39;s a steely spine there, too, and if you get him talking about ants, you discover he&amp;#39;s cheerfully obsessive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mooney and Kirshenbaum's prescription for improving the fate of science in this country is to train young scientists to be more media- and politics-savvy, to build a generation of cautious barometers of the public mood "capable of bridging the divides that have led to science's declining influence." And perhaps we could get more support for the arts if young artists were taught to favor bucolic photo-realism, if poetry was required to be in greeting card meter, and if all music was appropriate to elevators? We'd surely have a new renaissance if the NEA only funded art that a conservative senator would find inoffensive!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend something different. Our next generation of great science communicators should be flesh-and-blood people with personalities, every one different and every one with different priorities, all singing out enthusiastically for everything from astronomy to zoology, and they should sometimes be angry and sometimes sorrowful and sometimes deliriously excited. They shouldn't hesitate to say what they think, even if it might make Joe the Plumber surly. If you want to improve American science and the perception of science by the public, teach &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; first and foremost, because what you'll find is that your discipline is then populated with people who are there because they love the ideas. And, by the way, let them know every step of the way that &lt;b&gt;science is also a performing art&lt;/b&gt;, and that they have an obligation as a public intellectual to take their hard-earned learning and share it with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Face the fact that some of us (but definitely not all of us) will be so smitten with this wonderful, powerful way of thinking that we're going to follow our bliss and laugh at the hidebound ritualists who expect us to respect their superstitions, and at the prissy wanna-be moralists who demand bloodless conformity. You will not generate new Sagans by insisting on deference. You will not change a culture with a declining appreciation of science by demanding that scientists respect the beliefs of people who despise science the most. Mooney and Kirshenbaum single out the increasingly vibrant atheist sub-culture as something that needs to be muffled, and that's symptomatic of the failure of their suggestions: what other ideas should be stifled lest they disturb American complacency? And shouldn't shaking up that complacency be exactly what scientists &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

"&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=943"&gt;Reverse Whorfianism and SHAs&lt;/a&gt;", 12/23/2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other, more lexically specific, sources of confusion about statistical concepts and statements. One that I noticed for the first time yesterday is an ambiguity in the word &lt;em&gt;chance&lt;/em&gt;. Its popular use in the sense of probabilistic odds ("little chance of success"; "his chances are good" , etc.) is relatively recent, and has always overlapped with an older meaning that emphasizes complete unpredictability and the lack of any discernable cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This history helps explain the shocking sentence that I read yesterday on the online front page of the New York Times; "A longtime trainer uses an actuarial approach to predict injuries, defying the assumption that what happens to players is a matter of chance".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Society of Actuaries will be surprised to see &amp;quot;an actuarial approach&amp;quot; characterized as &amp;quot;defying the assumption that what happens … is a matter of chance&amp;quot;, since their web site &lt;a href="http://www.soa.org/about/about-what-is-an-actuary.aspx"&gt;tells us&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Actuaries use mathematics, statistics and financial theory to study uncertain future events, especially those of concern to insurance and pension programs. They evaluate the likelihood of those events, design creative ways to reduce the likelihood and decrease the impact of adverse events that actually do occur.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the American Statistical Association may wonder whether it should reconsider the name of its magazine, &lt;a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/chance/2009/22.2Web/index.cfm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OED gives the following etymology for &lt;em&gt;chance&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ME. &lt;em&gt;chea(u)nce&lt;/em&gt;, a. OF. &lt;em&gt;cheance&lt;/em&gt; (= Pr. &lt;em&gt;cazensa&lt;/em&gt;, It. &lt;em&gt;cadenza&lt;/em&gt;):–late L. &lt;em&gt;cadentia&lt;/em&gt; falling, f. &lt;em&gt;cadent-&lt;/em&gt; falling, pr. pple. of &lt;em&gt;cad-ĕre&lt;/em&gt; to fall: cf. CADENCE.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASA's magazine is named for the OED's sense &lt;strong&gt;5.a.&lt;/strong&gt;, "A possibility or probability of anything happening: as distinct from a certainty: often in plural, with a number expressed".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1778&lt;/strong&gt; T. JONES &lt;em&gt;Hoyle's Games Impr.&lt;/em&gt; 153, I would know how many Chances there are upon 2 Dice..The Answer is 36. &lt;strong&gt;1785&lt;/strong&gt; REID &lt;em&gt;Int. Powers&lt;/em&gt; 626 The doctrine of chances is a branch of mathematics little more than an hundred years old. &lt;strong&gt;1841-4&lt;/strong&gt; EMERSON &lt;em&gt;Ess.&lt;/em&gt; xix. Wks.

Lect.&lt;/em&gt; i. 7 The chances against any given grain reaching the pistil of another flower are immense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT teaser is apparently using the OED's sense &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;, "Absence of design or assignable cause, fortuity; often itself spoken of as the cause or determiner of events, which appear to happen without the intervention of law, ordinary causation, or providence". This meaning seems to be older:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1526&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pilgr. Perf.&lt;/em&gt; (W. de W. 1531) 144b, In cases of chaunce or vncertaynty. &lt;strong&gt;1581 &lt;/strong&gt;J.

Crew II. Wks.&lt;/em&gt; 1873 III. 389, I ha' not so much Wealth to weigh me down, Nor so little (I thank Chance) as to daunce naked. &lt;strong&gt;1722&lt;/strong&gt; WOLLASTON &lt;em&gt;Relig.

&lt;p&gt;The actual NYT article in question (Michael S. Schmidt, "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/sports/baseball/08injuries.html"&gt;Seeking a Way to Predict Baseball Injuries&lt;/a&gt;", NYT, 8/7/2009) presents a clear picture of the issues involved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The ability to predict how players’ bodies will fare is a holy grail. With an actuarial approach, [Stan] Conte [the Dodgers' head athletic trainer] seems to have a head start in the pursuit. He is trying to build a formula that would give teams a competitive advantage and help them avoid players who spend their days in the training room and not on the field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“The insurance industry has made millions of dollars off figuring out how, when, where and why people are going to die, and we are trying to figure those things out about injuries,” Conte said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But: it also explicit suggests that if something is "a matter of chance" or "a matter of luck", then it must be completely random and unpredictable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Conte believes the long-prevailing belief in baseball that injuries are a matter of chance is misguided.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;“I refuse to think we are doing all these things to get them healthy, and it’s a matter of luck whether lightning hits or doesn’t hit,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Note that there are plenty of difficult philosophical and practical questions in the area of probability, uncertainty, ignorance, and causation — see e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.ramas.com/ipbrussels.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But what underlies examples like those cited above seems to be too little thought about such puzzles, rather than too much. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247183744639"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/take_action_for_accessible_communications">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf9a3e56f30d41c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Take Action for Accessible Communications</title><published>2009-07-09T23:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T23:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/take_action_for_accessible_communications" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/devcentre/26077044/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/21/26077044_5ef19229d4_m.jpg" alt="close up of a communications satellite dish against a blue sky" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Especially as &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog?keyword=auditory+processing"&gt;auditory processing&lt;/a&gt; can be an issue for people on the spectrum (not to mention deaf and blind people on the spectrum, not to mention &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/accessibility_technology_and_universal_design"&gt;all people in general!&lt;/a&gt;), the 21st Century Communications &amp;amp; Video Accessibility Act of 2009, &lt;a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-3101"&gt;H.R. 3101&lt;/a&gt;, is an important piece of U.S. legislation.  This act would require, among other things, video captioning and descriptions for internet video programming and widespread accessibility of text messaging on mobile devices.  The focus of the act is on accessibility for Internet protocol based communications and emerging technology.  Whoot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/07/accessible-technology-bill-introduced.html"&gt;AAPD&lt;/a&gt;, here's the checklist for this bill:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.    Contact your Member of the United States House of Representatives. Ask him or her to cosponsor H.R. 3101. Be sure to telephone, send E-mail, and a letter. Find your Member at &lt;a href="https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml"&gt;https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.    Write your two U.S. Senators and ask them to sponsor and introduce a similar bill to H.R. 3101. Find your Senators at &lt;a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm"&gt;http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.    Use the bullet points...&lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/07/accessible-technology-bill-introduced.html"&gt;[on the AAPD site]&lt;/a&gt; as appropriate and include any personal stories about lack of access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.    Thank Rep. Ed Markey for his leadership by using the Email Contact form at &lt;a href="http://markey.house.gov/index.php?option=com_email_form&amp;amp;Itemid=124"&gt;http://markey.house.gov/index.php?option=com_email_form&amp;amp;Itemid=124&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.    You can find a copy of this legislation on &lt;a href="http://www.Thomas.gov"&gt;http://www.Thomas.gov&lt;/a&gt; soon by typing in the bill number -- H.R. 3101.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.    Pass this Action Alert along to others and encourage them to send letters &amp;amp; E-mails, make phone calls and to complete online contact forms. Be sure to mention &amp;quot;H.R. 3101&amp;quot; in any text or calls made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.    If possible, please send a copy to AAPD of any letters sent: AAPD, 1629 K Street NW, Suite 950, Washington, DC 20006.  Attn. J. Simpson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've put together a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/actions/view/support_accessible_communications_and_video_hr_3101"&gt;change.org action&lt;/a&gt; that covers the letters of support to House Representatives item 1.--please take a moment to personalize the letter and send it out to your legislators!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone reading this would like to convert some of these other points into change.org actions, feel free--remember you can create (respectful and on topic please!) actions here too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247182309815"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/09/that-pew-report-on-science-and-america/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e5a2f1bb92897a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">The New Pew Report on Science and America</title><published>2009-07-09T22:30:21Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T22:30:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/09/that-pew-report-on-science-and-america/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everybody today wants to know our take on &lt;a href="http://people-press.org/report/528/"&gt;this massive data dump&lt;/a&gt;, not surprisingly. Certainly, the timing could not be better, given that our book emerges at the same time as this raft of new information on science and the public, which I’ve only begun to wade through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, my sense so far is that our book puts the flesh on the bones of the Pew data, but is broadly consistent with it. Pew gives lots of new raw numbers, some of them exceedingly alarming (e.g., “significantly fewer Americans volunteer scientific advances as one of the country’s most important achievements than did so a decade ago [27% today, 47% in May 1999]”); we narrate how things got to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s really excellent about the Pew study–conducted in partnership with the American Association for the Advancement of Science–is that it doesn’t just do the standard thing, e.g., survey the public and see how bad its responses to standard science questions are. Rather, it surveys *both* the public and a sampling of 2,500 scientists, and instead finds out how *different* they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the whole point of &lt;em&gt;Unscientific America&lt;/em&gt;, too–the “two cultures” approach, now with additional survey data–and the answer is: Boy are these two groups different. No wonder they talk past each other. No wonder we have so many conflicts, over science in politics, the media, religion, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have more on the Pew data soon.

This is turning into a very sad week for news about autism. Tuesday I wrote about the terribly sad and unnecessary &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/jeremy_frasers_unnecessary_death"&gt;death of 9-year-old Jeremy Fraser&lt;/a&gt; in March of this year. And then came reports about 10-year-old Michael Becht, Jr.: As reported in the July 7th &lt;a href="http://www.twincities.com/ci_12770735?source=most_viewed"&gt;Pioneer Press&lt;/a&gt;, Michael was found dead in his home in South St. Paul on Monday, July 6th. His mother, Patricia Becht, is the "only suspect" according to authorities. Becht and her 11-year-old daughter are both in the hospital with injuries but are expected to survive. Another daughter, 16-year-old Cara Freeman, has not been able to speak to either her mother or sister since Monday. In an interview with &lt;a href="http://KAALtv.com/article/stories/S1019367.shtml?cat=10151"&gt;KAALtv&lt;/a&gt; said "'"No way in a million years I’d imagine she'd do this. She loved us too much.'"  A relative noted that Becht, a single mother, had had "depression for years and has been on medication and in therapy for as long as she can remember."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Jeremy Fraser and Michael Becht, Jr., were autistic. The mothers of both boys have been accused in their deaths. Kristen LaBrie is accused of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/jeremy_frasers_unnecessary_death"&gt;withholding cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt; and Patricia Becht is suspected in her son's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me being the mother of an autistic son, hearing about stories like these cuts close to the bone, and I remember &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/beautiful-precious-and-happy-katherine-mccarron/"&gt;Katherine McCarron&lt;/a&gt;, who was three years old when she was killed by her mother, &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/mccarron-ruled-guilty-on-all-counts/"&gt;Karen McCarron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/a-ribbon-for-katherine/"&gt;Katie's birthday&lt;/a&gt; is July 22nd; she would have been 7 years old this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that all I can say is, after reading all these stories, I get up and go to wherever Charlie is and sit beside him, and am just glad for every moment, difficult and peaceful-easy, I have with him.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247179637771"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26613182.post-1247798773257680533">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78233caa3fcb4743</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Depressing Article</title><published>2009-07-09T22:01:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T22:02:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/07/depressing-article.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I have for the most part sworn off reading Discovery News because of its tendency, like New Scientist, to hype and misreport, I did see &lt;a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/07/09/science-public-poll.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="http://www.people-press.org"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; poll indicates that 27 percent of Americans say the nation's greatest achievements are in science, medicine and technology, more than any category other than don't know. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But that's down from 47 percent in a similar study a decade ago, the center reported Thursday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How depressing. The Europeans publish more science than we do, and continue to excel in a number of areas over the US (except military size which is what we have excelled in for decades).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But you know what? Considering that &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;87 percent of AAAS scientists believed that humans and other living things evolved naturally, compared with 32 percent of the general public&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I’ll take this as a win:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And 69 percent of Americans say all parents should be required to vaccinate their children, compared with 82 percent of scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Note, that says &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt;.

It’s a typical method of indoctrination.  Your parents believe something (i.e. Jesus) and they want you to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, religious parents want their kids to think on their own as well.  They don’t see themselves as “indoctrinating” their kids.  But they obviously have an influence on them and inevitably, the kids will imitate their parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When many atheists have children, they want to do something different.  They don’t want their kids to automatically become atheists simply because the parents don’t believe in a god.  Instead, they would like to give the kids tools to think on their own.  Hopefully then, the children will decide what to believe when they’re old enough to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do you influence your kids without indoctrinating them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dale McGowan&lt;/strong&gt; explains in his new video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/3YgM-A8A1ck%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x5d1719%26color2%3D0xcd311b&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=385" width="480" height="385"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the key part begins at the 6:12 mark but the whole video is worth checking out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the plea to religious parents to act in a similar way is fantastic.  I wonder how many of them do that sort of thing.&lt;br&gt;

Three months and more than 78 million downloads later, VideoLAN has announced VLC 1.0.0, or "Goldeneye."

&lt;p&gt;Your media will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, with VideoLAN's VLC media player for Windows, Mac, and Linux, it doesn't have to be. One of the amazing things about VLC is that it can play anything that you've ever even thought about playing. That random media format that one site in Ecuador requires--VLC likely plays it, while Windows Media, Apple QuickTime, etc. likely will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve been hearing from other atheists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro: He’s a brilliant scientist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Con: He believes in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all bring up that he’s an evangelical Christian and the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416542744?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1416542744"&gt;The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  In that book, he explains how he came to Christianity after he saw a &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/books/int/2006/08/07/collins/"&gt;frozen waterfall&lt;/a&gt; separated into three parts — i.e. Trinity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so that’s comical, and he really does believe that.  But this is the same man &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/books/int/2006/08/07/collins/index1.html"&gt;who said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… If God has any meaning at all, God is outside of the natural world. It is a complete misuse of the tools of science to apply them to this discussion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s the rare scientist who happens to believe in God.  It’s a personal belief and not one that he uses while working (though he may say he’s using science to understand how God works).  It’s not like Collins is about to use federal funding to investigate Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re doing a disservice by going after him just because he’s a Christian.  He is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the type of person we want in that position — a man who knows his science and separates his personal beliefs from his work.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you believe that science and religion cannot go together, it’s irrelevant here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he has any influence beyond the strict science, I think it’s far more likely that he’ll get Christians thinking about science in a more positive way than getting atheists to convert to Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect he’ll be a good NIH Director, not because of his faith or despite his faith.  He’s just a great scientist and I trust his expertise in the profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what if he believes in God?&lt;/em&gt;  In terms of the work he’ll do at the NIH, how will he be any different from an atheist in the same position?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s save any criticism for the religious people who try to mix their faith and their work and who use improper science.  There’s enough of them to go around.  Like those Christians from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/07/07/texas-careening-toward-doom/"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/07/arizona-state-senator-sylvia-allen-r-says-earth-is-6000-years-old/"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.  They deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Collins.&lt;/p&gt;

Read, react, re-post (only this time with feeling!).  This is, well, what we're all here for.  But it also means that certain ideas, attitudes, types of stories, and misconceptions that do not reflect off-line reality get recirculated and ultimately believed to be true.  It's a self-reinforcing, or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback#Types_of_feedback"&gt;positive, feedback loop&lt;/a&gt; of inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these misconceptions, peculiar to autism articles, is that self-advocacy is something only people without intellectual disability or complex support needs are able to engage in.  The irony of this is that the intellectual and broader developmental disability self-advocacy communities have well-developed models to successfully enable self-advocacy for people with intellectual disabilities or complex support needs; in my area, self-advocates with ID have accomplished far more at this point than self-advocates who are on the autistic spectrum but who do not have ID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-advocacy organizations for people with intellectual and other developmental disabilities &lt;a href="http://www.people1.org/about_us_history.htm"&gt;began in my state in the 1970's&lt;/a&gt;.  While the original People First organization is now defunct (though their &lt;a href="http://www.people1.org/"&gt;web site&lt;/a&gt; lives on), the organized ID/DD self-advocacy community is currently active in the form of &lt;a href="http://asksaal.org/"&gt;Self Advocates as Leaders&lt;/a&gt;, which influences public policy, provides self-advocacy training, and publishes &lt;a href="http://ocdd.org/index.php/ocdd/publications/category/people_first_connection/"&gt;self-advocate stories&lt;/a&gt;.  That group is affiliated with the nation-wide ID/DD self-advocacy organization &lt;a href="http://sabeusa.org"&gt;Self Advocates Becoming Empowered&lt;/a&gt; (look up your own state's chapter!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model my local group uses is the inclusion of skilled support staff who enable people with ID or complex support needs to participate in self-advocacy activities.  These staff assist with tasks like organization, transportation, and translation, but they do not make any decisions--they simply facilitate our ability to make our own decisions.  It is of importance that these support people have training and passion specifically in the area of encouraging self-advocates to speak their own minds.  This is important because speaking up for one's self is something which regular support staff often do not want "the client" to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one model and example, but probably not the only.  The People First movement has been around for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before accepting an assumption that people on the spectrum with ID or complex support needs can not self-advocate, it may be worth looking outside of the "autism community" at the broader ID/DD community.  It may be worth looking outside the Internet too.  Instead of stating "someone like that can't--" ask "has anyone like that ever--?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of experience out there we can draw from if we look to what is happening outside the blogosphere.  The Internet is big.  The world is bigger.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247165792474"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/best_criticism_of_cynthia_dunb.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d41b83950fa1f08</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Best criticism of Cynthia Dunbar yet</title><published>2009-07-09T19:02:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T19:02:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/xa5Vb68lScw/best_criticism_of_cynthia_dunb.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/best_criticism_of_cynthia_dunb.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dunbar is the creationist, anti-education kook that Governor Perry of Texas is considering putting in charge of the state board of education. &lt;a href="http://slacktivist.typepad.com/slacktivist/2009/07/subsubminimal.html"&gt;Slacktivist explains the problem with this&lt;/a&gt; — putting someone who wants to destroy the public education system in charge of the public education system is like making an arsonist the fire chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is indeed evidence that IE browser share has dropped at the expense of Firefox over recent months.  There is some evidence that there are problems with the way in which different versions of IE are counted which could be screwing up the stats.  Regardless, Market Share by Net Applications, the service which provides a monthly market share assessment, has failed to produce the July 1 results claiming that the data are under review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the responses that came to mind this weekend was in talking about the good religion had done him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Humanist: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;You describe how religion helped you through the rough parts of your life but also say that you’ve found unexpected peace being nonreligious.  Do you think you could have succeeded through the tough times without religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;William Lobdell&lt;/strong&gt;: I think I would have.  But at the time, religion served a really good purpose.  It brought me a new set of friends and it matured me quite a bit.  I think one of the challenges the “new atheist” community has is providing that support and sense of community for its members.  We don’t do a good job of it right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our communities aren’t as obvious.  We don’t have large buildings with stained glass windows and steeples announcing our presence.  But there &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;great communities for nontheists.  I’ve been to a number of gatherings with the Beltway Atheists and found them to be friendly and welcoming.  I don’t go as often as I should, but the Washington Ethical Society has an excellent sense of community and support.  There are local humanist chapters and affiliates across the nation.  If you want to join a group, you can find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m guessing there are other factors in play.  For one thing, life-long atheists such as myself weren’t brought up going to church every week.  My community came from secular sources: sports teams, technical theatre, and good friends.  But I can see how it might be different.  I gravitate towards groups of people who enjoy doing the same things I do, not just towards people who believe the same things I do.  To someone who was religious but lost faith, there might be more of an impetus to replace the lost religious community with a similarly (belief/identity)-based group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t claim to know how others feel about community – I’m something of an introvert and spend more time alone or in small groups than others do.  So I’d love to hear from all of you: how do you view community in the nontheistic population?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jesse Galef</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://friendlyatheist.com/feed/</id><title type="html">Friendly Atheist</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247163625330"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=556">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79b700f70b818e2c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Basic Science"/><category term="Herbs &amp; Supplements"/><category term="Nutrition"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Functional Medicine (FM)  What Is It?</title><published>2009-07-09T18:00:57Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T18:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=556" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Functional Medicine – What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After extensive searching and examination, my answer is still – only the originators of “FM” know. Or, at least one must assume they know, because so far as I can see, I certainly see nothing that distinguishes “FM” from other descriptions of sectarian and “complementary/Alternative Medicine/” practices. A difference may lie in the advocates’ assumptions to have found some “imbalance” of body chemistry or physiology before applying one or more unproved methods or substances.  From what I could determine, the “imbalance” or dysfunction is usually either imaginary or at least presumptive. And the general principles are so poorly defined as to allow practioners vast leeway to apply a host of unproven methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured there would be several ways to find out. One would be to read FM’s material – mainly what “they” placed on the Internet. Another would be to enter the system and find out as a patient or as a prospective practitioner what it is that “FM” claims to be. The third would be to listen to a practitioner or advocate on tape, disk, radio, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly cannot or will not enter as a physician, being retired and a poor spy. So the Net and a local radio talk show host have to suffice. I will take on several of their documents on the Net which one can read oneself, and that I will handle in two truncated reports, and the “FM” practice in a third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Web page (&lt;a href="http://www.functionalmedicine.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Institute for Functional Medicine&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.functionalmedicine.org/index.asp"&gt;http://www.functionalmedicine.org/index.asp&lt;/a&gt;) one finds the &lt;a href="http://www.functionalmedicine.org/about/whatis.asp" rel="nofollow"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional medicine is personalized medicine that deals with primary prevention and underlying causes instead of symptoms for serious chronic disease. It is a science-based field of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop here. “&lt;em&gt;Personalized medicine&lt;/em&gt;”: This is an implied straw man argument, implying that medicine is not personalized. Yet in standard medicine, every person’s case is dealt with as “personalized” by physicians.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary prevention&lt;/em&gt;“: This is a valid term originally applied to prevention of disease by modifying the risk factors that contribute to development of disease. There is nothing unique here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Underlying causes instead of  symptoms”&lt;/em&gt;: Another straw man implying that medicine treats only symptoms, not causes – straw man and false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the site, Functional Medicine “… is grounded in the following principles”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemical individuality describes the importance of individual variations in metabolic function that derive from genetic and environmental differences among individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Biochemical individuality” is a trick expression here. It was invented by Dr. Roger Williams of U. Texas 50 years ago to justify administering massive doses of vitamins and other supplements for “optimum health.” Linus Pauling adapted the concept, along with Soffer and Osmond’s massive vitamin concepts of “Orthomolecular Medicine.”  In response to the “orthomolecular” movement, Victor Herbert MD responded that “Orthomolecular Medicine” meant what Humpty Dumpty said about words in Through the Looking Glass: “… it means exactly what I choose it to mean - neither more, nor less. “  No such need for supplements has been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient-centered medicine emphasizes “patient care” rather than “disease care,” following Sir William Osler’s admonition that “It is more important to know what patient has the disease than to know what disease the patient has.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another straw man phrasing designed to separate medicine from one of its great teachers, and then to usurp his teaching and turn it into a form he would have rejected.  I have never seen a medical text advising “disease care.”  Diseases are defined and dealt with as entities in order to classify them, analyze them, and to discover treatments for them. This method is called “scientific method.” It is always a patient who is treated, with treatments proved through scientific method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic balance of internal and external factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verbiage is too vague and general to allow analysis. It could mean just about anything. To analyze each word combination would not add to understanding. The authors might know what they meant but a reader would not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web-like interconnections of physiological factors – an abundance of research now supports the view that the human body functions as an orchestrated network of interconnected systems, rather than individual systems functioning autonomously and without effect on each other. For example, we now know that immunological dysfunctions can promote cardiovascular disease, that dietary imbalances can cause hormonal disturbances, and that environmental exposures can precipitate neurologic syndromes such as Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the advocates expose their naivete and lack of comprehension of physiology and patho-physiology.  At the same time they draw conclusions from incomplete and inadequate information (immunologic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.) A “network of interconnected systems” says nothing other than the body and its organs and tissues are connected and each affects one or more other organs.  Is this new? Only if one misperceives the entire history of science and medicine and the information developed over the past 400 years, then substitutes for that history an entirely fictitious one in which organs are individual organisms that function independently of the others – i.e. the ears are not connected to the brain, which is not connected to the muscles … etc. This false argument is invented in order to present an appearance of special distinction; its purpose being to enable a random, disordered treatment approach of “special,” false distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health as a positive vitality - not merely the absence of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This definition of “health” as something more than “absence of disease” has been trumpeted for forty or more years and has yet to have developed any meaning, although many people nod their heads in affirmation at its utterance. These are  “Animal Farm” moments, yet a gold mine of them is here in this description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promotion of organ reserve as the means to enhance health span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Organ reserve?” There is such a thing as “reserve”, but so far as I know there is no “reserve” of an organ that can be built up or augmented by an intentional treatment, diet, life-style change, or supplement. Reserve stores of iron and other metabolic materials and vitamins can be augmented, but reserves of an organ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The description continues.  Read this section through without interruption if you can. Then read it through again, identifying what is meant by each statement, phrase, and clause.  Reader may see why I will stop the analysis at this point and let the advocate/writer’s words speak. I figured someone must be disguising a leg-pulling exercise here. Or, could it be that someone has misunderstanding of such a degree that would result in such language misuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next installment I will identify some of the originators and players and try to use examples of how one or more practitioners use “FM”.  Now, try your hand at the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional medicine&lt;/strong&gt; is anchored by an examination of the core clinical imbalances that underlie various disease conditions. Those imbalances arise as &lt;strong&gt;environmental inputs&lt;/strong&gt; such as diet, nutrients (including air and water), exercise, and trauma &lt;strong&gt;are processed&lt;/strong&gt; by one’s body, mind, and spirit through a unique set of genetic predispositions, attitudes, and beliefs. The &lt;strong&gt;fundamental physiological&lt;/strong&gt; processes include communication, both outside and inside the cell; bioenergetics, or the transformation of food into energy; replication, repair, and maintenance of structural integrity, from the cellular to the whole body level; elimination of waste; protection and defense; and transport and circulation. The &lt;strong&gt;core clinical imbalances&lt;/strong&gt; that arise from malfunctions within this complex system include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hormonal and neurotransmitter imbalances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxidation-reduction imbalances and mitochondropathy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detoxification and biotransformational imbalances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Immune imbalances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inflammatory imbalances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digestive, absorptive, and microbiological imbalances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural imbalances&lt;/strong&gt; from cellular membrane function to the musculoskeletal system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imbalances such as these are the precursors to the signs and symptoms by which we detect and label (diagnose) organ system disease. Improving balance – in the patient’s environmental inputs and in the body’s fundamental physiological processes – is the precursor to restoring health and it involves much more than treating the symptoms. Functional medicine is dedicated to improving the management of complex, chronic disease by intervening at multiple levels to address these core clinical imbalances and to restore each patient’s functionality and health. Functional medicine is not a unique and separate body of knowledge. It is grounded in scientific principles and information widely available in medicine today, combining research from various disciplines into highly detailed yet clinically relevant models of disease pathogenesis and effective clinical management.Functional medicine emphasizes a definable and teachable &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; of integrating multiple knowledge bases within a pragmatic intellectual matrix that focuses on functionality at many levels, rather than a single treatment for a single diagnosis. Functional medicine uses the patient’s story as a key tool for integrating diagnosis, signs and symptoms, and evidence of clinical imbalances into a comprehensive approach to improve both the patient’s environmental inputs and his or her physiological function. It is a clinician’s discipline, and it directly addresses the need to transform the practice of primary care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high school dropout problem is a severe epidemic for the United States, as nationwide, it is reported that only 71 percent of students graduate from high school. Understanding the magnitude of the problem and the forces that impact dropout rates is critically important to developing effective strategies. High school students are dropping out at alarming rates every day across the country. There is urgency for obtaining more accurate, consistent, and timely data to analyze who is dropping out and the reasons contributing to these life-altering decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To curb the alarming dropout rate, school systems should focus prevention efforts in the beginning of the middle grades if not earlier. The key indicators that researchers have identified as indicative of who is most likely to drop out are: poor grades in core subjects, low attendance, failure to be promoted to the next grade, and disengagement in the classroom, including behavioral problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These key indicators can assist decision makers in targeting prevention resources to the students most at risk of imminently leaving school. Some very useful prevention strategies include: small learning communities and school within a school for greater personalization, partnerships between high schools and feeder middle schools, ninth grade transition programs, support for students with disabilities outside of school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I wonder if improving reading scores beginning in the very early grades would have a positive effect.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked &lt;a href="http://blogging4biology.edublogs.org/" title=""&gt;Stacy Baker&lt;/a&gt;, everyone's favorite &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/" title=""&gt;Biology cyber-teacher&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a high school biology teacher.  I've taught general, honors, and advanced placement biology for the past four years.  Prior to teaching I worked as a biologist and studied seabirds in the Pribilof Islands and migrating seabirds off the Atlantic coast.  I also worked a few years in wildlife rehabilitation.  I have a BS in Zoology from Washington State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up I would answer, "Anything, but a teacher."  I'm serious!  My mom's a teacher and growing up watching her work long hours and get very little very financial reward turned me against the profession.  Why on earth would anyone want to be a teacher?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life has a funny way of making you eat your words.  When I was working in the field I would occasionally have the opportunity to share what I was doing with local K-12 students.  My colleagues said I had a gift for teaching and I suppose when enough people tell you you're really good at something you start to wonder if it's what you're meant to do.  I've really enjoyed teaching despite its many frustrations.  The kids make it fun.  Some days I feel like I've spent the whole day laughing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web makes current science accessible to my students.  The Open Access movement and science blogs make it easy to connect my students with scientists and original research.  The web is a great way to make science exciting again.  My students get tired of learning about what's already been done and it excites them to talk with scientists about what is currently being researched.  If a scientist talks with them about what they're doing, my students often will (&lt;i&gt;on their own without even being asked&lt;/i&gt;) research everything about that topic and learn all the content they need to know in the process.  Some of these students are the ones who walked into my classroom saying they hate science.  They walk out with a completely different attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed, YouTube, Flickr, Ning, Facebook and others?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My students maintain and update our class blog, &lt;a href="http://www.missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog" title=""&gt;Extreme Biology&lt;/a&gt;.  At the beginning of every school year, a new group of students is trained on how to use the blog.  For most of my students this is the first introduction they've had into blogging so the learning curve is pretty steep.  I'm hopeful that as the years go by, more students will enter my class having already used blogs and other web tools and I'll be able to skip the time-consuming training and jump right into the science.  As the year progresses, my students will discover new tools for us to try.  They find current science research to blog about and then put a creative spin on the topic in order to educate their peers.  Some of them &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/?p=921" title=""&gt;write songs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/?p=878" title=""&gt;create animations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/?p=875" title=""&gt;make videos&lt;/a&gt;, and previous students return to &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/?p=848" title=""&gt;share advice&lt;/a&gt;.  We even had our own &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclass.com/blog/?cat=15" title=""&gt;series of interviews&lt;/a&gt; of Science Online '09 participants!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the blog we have a class &lt;a href="http://missbakersbiologyclasswiki.wikispaces.com/" title=""&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, youtube &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/stacystube" title=""&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/extremebiology" title=""&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://extremebiology.ning.com/" title=""&gt;ning&lt;/a&gt;.  The public twitter was only started at the end of the last school year so it hasn't really taken off, yet.  I also have a private twitter feed with my students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The session about using the Web in the classroom which you led together with eight of your students was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/01/scienceonline09_-_saturday_101.php" title=""&gt;The Big Hit of the Conference&lt;/a&gt;. We all learned a lot from it. What did you learn from it, from the audience questions and comments?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to thank everyone in the audience for being so wonderful and treating my students like mini-celebrities!  They floated on clouds for weeks afterward!  We learned that kids really have a lot of power when it comes to how the web is being used.  Their voices truly matter.  My students arrived at the conference feeling unsure and a bit intimidated, but they left with a ton of confidence.  The audience fired questions at them the entire time and the students did a remarkable job of answering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I floated on clouds for weeks afterward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favorites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details are too fuzzy because it's been so many years now.  Yours!  But, in addition to yours there are too many great science blogs to pick favorites.  I will say that my students have received a lot of positive feedback from bloggers they've interacted with here on ScienceBlogs and I'm really grateful for that.  Many of the blogs mentioned at the conference I already knew about, but my students made a ton of new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

What motivated you to spend this summer in the lab, learning some of the most cutting-edge techniques in molecular and cellular neuroscience - not easy stuff to do by all means?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I'm working in &lt;a href="http://bbs.yale.edu/faculty/nit_mi.html" title=""&gt;Michael Nitabach's lab&lt;/a&gt; at Yale studying circadian rhythms in fruit flies.  The project is funded by a NIH grant directed at getting science teachers involved in research.  While I can't share the details of the original research project Dr. Nitabach has me working on, I can say it's very exciting and that I'm learning a lot.  The lab is pretty fast-paced as its filled with post-docs, grad students, and undergrads.  A lot of great ideas get thrown around in the "fly room" each day, during lab meetings, and department cookie breaks.  I love all the Drosophila jargon that gets thrown around and I'm trying to convince the lab to make "fly pusher" shirts this summer.  Fruit flies are a fun model to work with and they make genetics very accessible to students so I'm excited about taking everything I've learned back to the classroom.  Check out the cool &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stacysflickr/3680190938/" title=""&gt;fly brain&lt;/a&gt; I dissected last week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience I'm gaining in Dr. Nitabach's lab is going to make me a better teacher.  I didn't enter the teaching profession in the traditional way.  At the risk of upsetting the traditionalists, I believe there is total lunacy in allowing a person to teach science who has never actually practiced science.  You can't learn science by reading textbooks or taking educational methodology classes.  Every science teacher needs to have the experience of participating in original research and they need to routinely refresh their skills.  The last time I performed science in the field was five years ago.  I feel quite rusty.  In my perfect teaching ideal, science educators would teach for 4-5 years and then take one-year off to work on an original research project.  I realize this is incredibly unrealistic thanks to the immobile system we have in place to train teachers, but due to my non-traditional background this type of ideal is possible for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH grant was offered through the use of the ARRA money.  Hopefully, NIH will seriously consider offering the grant every year.  It would be a strong investment into the future of science education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;As you are applying for jobs, is the schools' attitude towards the use of the Web in the classroom high on your list of criteria?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!  I was told in an interview recently that I wouldn't be able to continue my blogging at that school.  I politely ended the interview.  It's become so much a part of my methodology that I don't think I could ever abandon it.  Not every student has the luxury of having a home computer, but there is simply no excuse for a school to not have enough computer resources to offer their students.  If a teacher has a detailed plan on how they use the Web safely in their classroom, they should be allowed to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reception we received has motivated me to seek more ways my students can directly interact with practicing scientists.  I also want to have my students more involved in participating in online conversations with scientists outside of just our blog.  Some of them already do that, but I'd like to see more of them doing so.  For example, I'd like them to have a journal club and discuss a paper on PLoS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to finally meet you in person and thank you for the interview (and say Hi to all your students). I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful to meet you as well!  See you in January!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A while back the PAMELA experiment claimed to see an &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/04/looking-for-dark-matter-in-all-the-wrong-places/"&gt;excess of high-energy positrons&lt;/a&gt; in cosmic rays — a signal that could come from imperfectly-understood astrophysical objects such as pulsars, or might be produced by something more exotic like dark matter annihilations.  Some damper on enthusiasm for this idea was introduced by new results from the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/05/04/fermi-waffles-on-dark-matter/"&gt;Fermi observatory&lt;/a&gt;, but it wasn’t completely conclusive, since Fermi’s detectors can’t actually distinguish between positrons and electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1026"&gt;Pierre Colin and collaborators&lt;/a&gt; have hit upon a cute way to distinguish between electrons and positrons:  treat the magnetosphere of the Earth like the interior of a giant particle detector.  Ever since &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber"&gt;cloud chambers&lt;/a&gt;, physicists have put magnetic fields in their detectors to help distinguish between positively charged particles and negatively charged particles, which get pushed in opposite directions.  Well, the Earth has a magnetic field, so maybe we can use that.  The problem is that the positrons and electrons would still all hit a telescope such as &lt;a href="http://wwwmagic.mppmu.mpg.de/"&gt;MAGIC&lt;/a&gt;, so the fact that they were deflected by the magnetic field wouldn’t be very relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Colin et al. suggest a trick: using the Moon’s shadow.  Let’s imagine that the excess positrons really are coming from dark matter annihilating in the galactic center.  When the moon is near the position of the galactic center in the sky, it will block out some of those particles, casting a shadow on ground-based telescopes.  That’s already interesting, but the fun part is that positrons and electrons will be deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field, so the positron shadow will be in a slightly different position than the electron shadow!  Using that effect, it may be possible to distinguish between the signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am completely unable to judge how feasible this actually is.  But the idea is sufficiently imaginative, I’m sure rooting for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247159886414"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/blowing_smoke_over_secondhand_smoke.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5599d54be7579e72</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Blowing smoke over secondhand smoke</title><published>2009-07-09T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/olE-DOVpFbM/blowing_smoke_over_secondhand_smoke.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/blowing_smoke_over_secondhand_smoke.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Classic Insolence logo" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/upload/2006/08/ClassicInsolence.jpg" width="200" height="150" style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm currently in Las Vegas anxiously waiting for The Amazing Meeting to start. Believe it or not, I'll even be on a panel! While I'm gone,  I'll probably manage to do a new post or two, but, in the meantime, while I'm away communing with fellow skeptics at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2007.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"What do you think about second hand smoke?" &lt;a href="http://www.timslagle.com/blog/2005/11/pressed-and-repressed.html"&gt;he&lt;/a&gt; asked me. I sensed ulterior motives behind the question, but I wasn't sure. I suspected that he was just looking for an argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's bad," I joked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Some have told me that the studies don't show any health problems from second hand smoke," he replied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm sure 'some' have," I retorted somewhat sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"No, really, is there any evidence," he replied. "I'm open-minded about this topic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I doubted this, but I figured, what the heck, and did a little reviewing. It makes for some interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/blowing_smoke_over_secondhand_smoke.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/blowing_smoke_over_secondhand_smoke.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/olE-DOVpFbM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247159515286"><id gr:original-id="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/?p=1730">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9fd61ee10171b04b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Unprincipled Healthcare Part Three: Nutrition And Health Claims</title><published>2009-07-09T16:32:46Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T16:32:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/07/09/unprincipled-healthcare-part-three-nutrition-and-health-claims/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">The regulations on nutrition and health claims apply to all nutrition and health claims made in commercial communications.

If they want to truly expose their children to religious ideas then they should send their children to different churches for a month at a time, or more. Have them attend them in a random order. Have them attend a Mormon, Jehovah's Witness, Seventh-Day Adventist, United Church of Christ, Congregational, Methodist, Lutheran, Catholic, Unitarian, Disciples of Christ, and Non-instrumental Church of Christ churches. And don't forget a Jewish Synagogue, a Muslim Mosque, a snake handling service, a Pentecostal healing service, and so on and so on, and so on and so on. If this skeptical parent truly wants to expose his children to the religious ideas of his culture then give them the whole range of choices to choose from. And don’t forget to take these children to atheist meet-ups, and freethought gatherings too. Then these children can truly choose for themselves. Then these children can be truly educated about these ideas. And then these children will most assuredly choose to be skeptics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing but total exposure to the varying options will educate his children. This is what Daniel Dennett proposes with regard to educating our youths in American schools, but will probably never fly because of First Amendment concerns. When placed on a equal playing field religious options are no options at all. &lt;strong&gt;THAT’s&lt;/strong&gt; why I love Bill Maher’s movie &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001MFNB5I?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001MFNB5I&amp;amp;adid=1WM8A121B59VW04P8NQX&amp;amp;"&gt; Religulous&lt;/a&gt;, because it does just that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One danger in sending our children to the same church over and over is that children are easily swayed to believe what an authority figure tells them in a community of happy looking, but deluded, people. Take for instance Norman Geisler, known as the "Dean of Christian Apologetics." He was raised in an atheist home, but because of a bus ministry he went to church every Sunday for nine years and was swayed to accept and then later defend Christianity. His parents thought the same thing as this skeptic, but they were wrong to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-2685781961058820774?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Ella is &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;quoted in the Independent&lt;/a&gt; (something I somehow missed last time I looked at it) as having attended a swine flu party, so is this the first evidence that these parties have actually taken place? (HT: "sTeamTraen")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been to a swine flu party – but it didn't start out like that. It was a regular teenager's party until the conversation turned to swine flu and it turned out that my friend's boyfriend has it so it's likely that my friend, who is also 15, does as well. Everyone started laughing because the idea of a friend having swine flu was quite funny. It was one of those things that you hear about on the news and think will never affect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the "swine flu party" started: a coughing fit from my friend all over everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, lovely. So to begin with, this wasn't actually a swine flu party, just a bunch of teenage girls - none of whom apparently have the flu - spontaneously coughing over each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ella isn't just some average kid they found; she has apparently been writing for the Independent since 2008, covering everything from &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/first-night-harry-potter-and-the-halfblood-prince-odeon-leicester-square-1736209.html"&gt;reviews of the latest Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; to articles about &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/seven-ages-of-love/the-seven-ages-of-love-the-teenagers-view-942408.html"&gt;the teenage view of sex&lt;/a&gt; . Prior to that she appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1558082/Four-young-reviewers-give-their-verdicts.html"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; aged just thirteen. It's a bit cynical to present her as an average kid who happens to have been involved in swine flu parties when neither part of that is really true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it's not fair to criticise Ella for this. The girl has talent, and anyone with the skill, talent and maturity to be writing for the national press in their early teens should be encouraged - she is undoubtedly a great kid. However, one has to question the ethics of the editor in using this sort of story. It's all too reminiscent of, well, this guy:&lt;/p&gt;

Older posts on this can be found &lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/information-in-dna/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://morsdei.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/dna-is-not-code/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;“Code” may be defined as any of the following:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) a set of rules for converting information into another form or representation (encoding) for later retrieval&lt;br&gt;
2) a set of rules or principles or laws (not applicable in this case)&lt;br&gt;
3) a system of transmitting messages for brevity and/or security (also not applicable)&lt;br&gt;
4) the symbolic arrangement of data or instructions in a computer program or the set of such instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Is DNA a code?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DNA molecule is, itself, neither a set of rules, nor is it symbolic of data or instructions. DNA molecules are sequences of nucleotides which can be broken down into reading frames, promoters, enhancers, structural and spacial segments, and so forth. Since the DNA molecule has such variability and physical functionality inherent within it, the metaphor of DNA being information or a “code” is both overly simplistic and inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What about RNA?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, functional segments of the “code” exist without ever being “decoded.” Some segments of RNA, for example, spliceosomes, ribozymes, and ribozomes are in the same sequences as the DNA template.  Even ignoring the function inherent in many RNA transcripts (spliceosomes, ribozymes, ribozomes, etc.) which are still “the raw code,” we can continue on both ends. The DNA sequence itself, as well as the transcripts which are translated into proteins, are similarly not information. While codes rely upon symbolic arrangements to transmit data or instructions, the arrangement of DNA merely serves as a template by which RNA transcripts are made; this is more like a mold than a code as the resulting copy of a DNA template is the reverse and opposite of the template itself: the DNA sequence 5′AAGCTTGGCAT3′ is transcribed into the RNA sequence 5′AUGCCAAGCUU3′. What, also, is the magical “information” this DNA sequence is supposed to carry? Thus far, it appears the RNA is not information, nor is the DNA itself information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Proteins?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be the proteins which result from some RNA transcripts which are the “information” in DNA? No. Proteins also do not transmit information; while the protein is useful, it is as much “information” as a car is a manual to assemble a new one. Proteins were never “encoded” from protein to RNA to DNA in order to be properly “decoded,” the function of a protein is based upon its physical structure, as is the function of RNA and DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Well, what is the “genetic code?”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear this phrase all the time, mostly by individuals who have no understandings of even the basics of genetics. The genetic code is the means by which we (humans) organize DNA into bits which we can understand. We remove the three-dimensional context and focus exclusively on the sequence. &lt;em&gt;From this, the simplistic explanation (DNA-&amp;gt;RNA-&amp;gt;”magical protein”) that DNA is arranged in codons. These codons hold the “magical information” which becomes “magical protein,” which as we all know, is what DNA is all about.&lt;/em&gt; This is where the confusion lies. DNA does not just contain sequences for protein; functional units exist outside of any reading frames including promoters, enhancers, suppressors, etc. Other functional segments exist as well (centromeres, telomeres, and origins of replication) which contradicts the idea that DNA is like a software program. The genetic code is, in this respect, a human construct to understand specific regions of DNA which &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; contain sequences used for protein production. This is the only use this phrase has.&lt;/p&gt;

(HT: "sTeamTraen")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been to a swine flu party – but it didn't start out like that.

These aren't particularly accurate and should be taken with a pinch of salt, and the same pattern is not reflected in the United States, but they illustrate a worrying point. The graph at the bottom shows media mentions of swine flu parties in the United Kingdom over time, while the top graph shows search volume from British users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/viz.png" width="520"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Broadly speaking then, it appears that much of the public's interest in swine flu parties, as crudely measured by Google search results, was prompted by coverage of the phenomenon in the media. This begs the question, to what extent did these parties exist prior to the media coverage of them? Did newspapers report the story, or create it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why these parties are such a bad idea should be pretty obvious - they involve deliberately making children ill, the majority of whom would never have been ill in the first place; and if enough people take part they cause the illness to spread much more rapidly through the population than it would otherwise. With vaccines not yet widely available and health workers racing to prepare ahead of the expected winter outbreak it's a particularly short-sighted approach to take, and of course there's no guarantee that little Tarquin will be immune anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response of the British government and media to swine flu has been generally &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/07/uk_health_minister_exponential.php"&gt;poor and dithering&lt;/a&gt;. Swine flu is a &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/04/parmageddon/"&gt;very genuine threat&lt;/a&gt;, but it's the sort of threat that's hard to convey to the public - possibly very dangerous but unpredictable, and likely to be slow moving for many months. Media coverage inevitably veered wildly between predicting "Parmageddon" and mocking the "scare-mongering". In the meantime, swine flu has spread, affecting several thousand people and killing a handful so far - children have been &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/06/three-deaths-swine-flu-uk"&gt;particularly vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;. The failure to contain the pandemic in the UK led to the government &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/02/swine-flu-uk"&gt;abandoning their containment strategy&lt;/a&gt; last week and adopting an aggressive treatment policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the first mentions of swine flu parties appeared on Mumsnet.com, an internet forum frequented by middle class mothers. As the website's founder, Justine Roberts, &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;explained to &lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there was no evidence that any parties had been arranged, merely a discussion of &lt;i&gt;"the principle of whether it might be a good idea."&lt;/i&gt; Roberts gave an odd defense of this thinking &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;in &lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ms Roberts said she believed parents had become confused by the Government's policy of keeping schools open while at the same time telling them to take all precautions against their children contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;'No one wants to cause hysteria,&lt;/i&gt; she said. &lt;i&gt;'The Government has an agenda, I assume, about having to control the infection, but the truth of the matter is either you should get it now or try to avoid getting it – you can't have it both ways. It's so easy to give a glib representation of ignorant parents who are acting hysterically.'&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, I imagine, took the view that mass closures of schools that would be breaking up for the summer soon anyway, during exam periods, would be going to far, but what I don't understand is how the suggestion that people should continue to go about their ordinary lives, while remaining vigilant, is somehow morphed into &lt;i&gt;"you should get it now."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, at the time of writing I've seen no evidence whatsoever that any such parties have actually taken place. The entire story seems to be based on claims from a person promoting a parenting website that the idea has been discussed on an internet forum. In short, it was a non-story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet on the basis of this non-story, Roberts was interviewed by national newspapers, mentioned in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1908407,00.html"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and appeared on radio shows to 'debate' public health policy with health professionals. In the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;Independent article&lt;/a&gt; I cited earlier, a website owner is given 4 paragraphs in which to state their views, while the Government's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson, representing the views of basically the entire British medical profession, gets just two and a bit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there is a case for reporting and addressing the concerns of parents. Doubtless government advice can be confusing (and at times confused), and so responsible coverage of the issues involved is a Good Thing. The problem is that, as far as I and others who have researched this can make out, swine flu parties don't exist. Far from addressing the issue, Roberts is being given a vast platform on which to promote it (and of course her website). In all probability the vast majority of parents had never even heard of or considered the idea before it burst into the newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the story of the swine flu parties was never real, but there's a certain relentlessness about the largely unconscious creation of the media myth. There's no reason to believe that at any stage people made things up - rather a grain of truth was shaped and polished and embellished in a machine that seems to run on autopilot. The result is a fusion of fact and myth that exists in its own reality, and yet - if the rough results from Google Trends are anything to go by - is beginning to distort our own. By the end of the summer, the story could well be real, and if it is then it will have been created by the media.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of the extreme ranges of a plant or animal moving north or south, or across a gradient of rainfall, or up or down in elevation, organisms that are protected in parks are also stuck in the parks and risk local extinction when change happens or disease becomes endemic, or poaching uncontrolled or fire more common or .... well, we can go on and on. &lt;/p&gt;

A couple of the sessions, though, are funded by the Templeton Foundation, which sounds much less fun. Fortunately, Dan Dennett has taken a bullet for the team and attended those meetings, and files a report on location — he describes it as &amp;quot;wonderfully awful&amp;quot;, with some exceptions. I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind listening to Pascal Boyer talk on religion, but the rest…I shudder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's his account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am attending and participating in the big Cambridge University Darwin Week bash, and I noticed that one of the two concurrent sessions the first day was on evolution and theology, and was 'supported by the Templeton Foundation' (though the list of Festival Donors and Sponsors does not include any mention of Templeton). I dragged myself away from a promising session on speciation, and attended. Good thing I did. It was wonderfully awful. We heard about the Big Questions, a phrase used often, and it was opined that the new atheists naively endorse the proposition that "There are no meaningful questions that science cannot answer." Richard Dawkins' wonderful sentence about how nasty the God of the  Old Testament is was read with relish by Philip Clayton, Professor at Claremont School of Theology in California, and the point apparently was to illustrate just how philistine these atheists were--though I noticed that he didn't say he disagreed with Richard's evaluation of Yahweh. We were left to surmise, I guess, that it was tacky of Richard to draw attention to these embarrassing blemishes in an otherwise august tradition worthy of tremendous respect.  The larger point was the complaint that the atheists have a "dismissive attitude toward the Big Questions" and Dawkins, in particular, didn't consult theologians. (H. Allen Orr, they were singing your song.) Clayton astonished me by listing God's attributes: according to his handsomely naturalistic theology, God is not omnipotent,  not even supernatural, and . . . . in short Clayton is an atheist who won't admit it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  The second talk was by J. Wentzel van Huyssteen, a Professor of  Theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, and it was an instance of  "theological anthropology," full of earnest gobbledygook about embodied minds and larded with evolutionary tidbits drawn from Frans de Waal, Steven Mithen and others.  In the discussion period I couldn't stand it any more and challenged the speakers: "I'm Dan Dennett, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and we are forever being told that we should do our homework and consult with the best theologians. I've heard two of you talk now, and you keep saying this is an interdisciplinary effort--evolutionary theology--but I am still waiting to be told what theology has to contribute to the effort. You've clearly adjusted your theology considerably in the wake of Darwin, which I applaud, but what traffic, if any, goes in the other direction? Is there something I'm missing? What questions does theology ask or answer that aren't already being dealt with by science or secular philosophy? What can you clarify for this interdisciplinary project?" (Words to that effect)  Neither speaker had anything to offer, but van Huyssteen  blathered on for a bit without, however,  offering any instances of theological wisdom that every scientist interested in the Big Questions should have in his kit.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I learned a new word: "kenotic" as in kenotic theology. It comes from the Greek word kenosis meaning 'self-emptying.' Honest to God. This new kenotic theology is all the rage in some quarters, one gathers, and it is "more deeply Christian for being more adapted to Darwinism." (I'm not making this up.) I said that I was glad to learn this new word and had to say that I was tempted by the idea that kenotic theology indeed lived up to its name. At the coffee break, some folks told me my question had redeemed the session for them, but I would guess I irritated others with my persistent request for something of substance to chew on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After the second set of two talks, which I was obliged to listen to since the moderator promised more responses to my "challenge" and I had to stay around to hear them out, there was another half hour of discussion. I did my duty: I listened attentively, I asked questions, and the theologians were embarrassingly short on answers, though one recommended David Chalmers on panpsychism--a philosopher, not a theologian, and second, nobody, not even Chalmers, takes panpsychism seriously, to the best of my knowledge. Do theologians?
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The third speaker was Dr. Denis Alexander of Cambridge University, and he had some interesting historical scholarship on the varying positions on progress and purpose offered by thinkers from Erasmus Darwin-who had surmised that all life began from a single "living filament" (nice guess!)-through Darwin and Spencer and the Huxleys and on to Gould and Dawkins (and me).  Particularly useful was a late quote from Gould's last book (p468 if you want to run it down) in which he allowed, contrary to his long-held line on contingency, that evolution did exhibit "directional properties" that could not be ignored.  The conclusion of Alexander's talk was that it is nowadays a little "more plausible that it isn't necessarily the case that the evolutionary process doesn't have a larger purpose."  That is certainly a circumspect and modest conclusion.  The fourth speaker was the Catholic Father Fraser Watt (of Cambridge University School of Divinity, and a big Templeton grantsman, as noted by the chair).  He introduced us to "evolutionary Christology." Again, I'm not making this up. Evolution, it turns out, was planned by an intelligent God to create a species "capable of receiving the incarnation"--though this particular competence of our species might be, in Watts' opinion, a "spandrel." Jesus was "a spiritual mutation, " and "the culmination of the evolutionary process," marking a turning point in world history. A member of the audience cheekily asked if Father Watt was saying that Jesus's parents were both normal human beings then? (I was going to press the point: perhaps Jesus's madumnal genes from Mary were the product of natural selection but his padumnal genes were hand crafted by the Holy Spirit!--but Father Watt forestalled the inquiry by declaring that he had no knowledge or opinion about Jesus' parentage--something that his Catholic colleagues will presumably not appreciate.)
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            Afterwards I was asked if I had enjoyed the session, and learned anything, and I allowed as how I had. I would not have dared use the phrase "evolutionary Christology" for fear of being condemned as a vicious caricaturist of worthy, sophisticated theologians, but now I had heard the term used numerous times, and would be quoting it in the future, as an example of the sort of wisdom that sophisticated theology has to offer to evolutionary biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            I had an epiphany at the end of the session, but I kept it to myself: The Eucharist is actually a Recapitulation of the Eukaryotic Revolution. When Christians ingest the Body of Christ, without digesting it, but keep it whole (holistier-than-thou whole), they are re-enacting the miracle of endosymbiosis that paved the way for eventual multi-cellularity. And so, dearly beloved brethren, we can see that by keeping Christ intact in our bodies we are keeping His Power intact in our embodied Minds, or Souls, just the way the first Eukaryote was vouchsafed a double blessing of earthly competence that enabled its descendants to join forces in Higher Organizations. Evolutionary theology. . . . I think I get it! I can do it! It truly is intellectual tennis without a net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is another Templeton session on The Evolution of Religion, with Pascal Boyer, David Sloan Wilson, Michael Ruse and Harvey Whitehouse. Dr. Fraser Watt, our evolutionary Christologist, will be chairing the session. It will be interesting to see how docile these mammals are in the feeding trough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second Templeton-sponsored session (at the Cambridge Darwin Festival) was more presentable.  On the evolution of religion, it featured clear, fact-filled presentations by Pascal Boyer and Harvey Whitehouse, a typical David Sloan Wilson advertisement for his multi-level selection approach, and an even more typical meandering and personal harangue from Michael Ruse.  The session was chaired, urbanely and without any contentful intervention, by Fraser Watt, our evolutionary christologist. (I wonder: should "christology" be capitalized?   Ian McEwan asked me if there was, perhaps, a field of X-ray christology.  I've been having fun fantasizing about how that might revolutionize science and open up a path for the Crick and Watson of theology!) 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I learned something at the session. Boyer presented a persuasive case that the "packaging" of the stew of separable and largely independent items as "religion" is itself ideology generated by the institutions, a sort of advertising that has the effect of turning religions into "brands" in competition. Whitehouse gave a fascinating short account of the Kivung cargo cult in a remote part of Papua New Guinea that he studied as an anthropologist, living with them for several years.  A problem: the Kivung cult has the curious belief that their gods (departed ancestors) will return, transformed into white men, and bearing high technology and plenty for all.  This does present a challenge for a lone white anthropologist coming to live with them for awhile, camera gear in hand, and wishing to be as unobtrusive as possible.  Wilson offered very interesting data from a new study by his group on a large cohort of American teenagers, half Pentecostals and half Episcopalians (in other words, maximally conservative and maximally liberal), finding that on many different scales of self-assessment, these young people are so different that they would look to a biologist like "different species."  Ruse declared that while he is an atheist, he wishes that those wanting to explain religion wouldn't start with the assumption that religious beliefs are false.  He doesn't seem to appreciate the role of the null hypothesis or the presumption of innocence in trials.  We also learned tidbits about his life and his preference--as an atheist--for the Calvinist God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/dennett_and_evolutionary_chris.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/-U2NBvNIth0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247153325609"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/shes_gotten_a_little_chunky_ov.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca81bf0c8699a4b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">She's gotten a little chunky over two millennia</title><published>2009-07-09T15:19:03Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T15:19:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/nAeWwXkP70A/shes_gotten_a_little_chunky_ov.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/shes_gotten_a_little_chunky_ov.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/07/shes_gotten_a_little_chunky_ov/treestump.jpeg" width="200" height="281" alt="treestump.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Irish workmen were cutting down a tree, and lo and behold, the &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0709/1224250319175.html"&gt;stump supposedly resembles the Virgin Mary&lt;/a&gt;, although how they found a hymen in that lump, I don't know. The real source of amusement, though, is the way it has put the local Catholic church representatives in a dither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local parish priest Fr Willie Russell said on radio station Limerick Live 95FM yesterday that people should not worship the tree. "There's nothing there . . . it's just a tree . . . you can't worship a tree."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the Irish druids are going to be rightly upset at this horribly offensive slur against their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Limerick diocesan office said the "church's response to phenomena of this type is one of great scepticism".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R i g h t. That would be a first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we do not wish in any way to detract from devotion to Our Lady, we would also wish to avoid anything which might lead to superstition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says the fellow with a fine collection of saints' feast days, magic crackers, sacred relics, and chants and rituals to invoke supernatural powers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/shes_gotten_a_little_chunky_ov.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/nAeWwXkP70A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247153265767"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8064">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b0e173f533a8d6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 7.9</title><published>2009-07-09T15:00:49Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T15:00:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=8064" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a pre-recorded quickie as I am currently winging my way to TAM.

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;My first sex dream was about Doogie Howser. I can't help it. I have a bit of a penchant for nerdy men who can talk science to me. I feel better now for having confessed that -- as though we can continue on together with a level of established honesty between us.

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;My first fantasy, however, was about these:

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;I have to say that I was saddened, after &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/happy_blog-o-versary_to_me_now.php#comment-1760630"&gt;reading the request for size 13 heels&lt;/a&gt;, that these are only available up to size 11.

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Christiana by J. Renee in Metallic Pewter Snake. Personally, I would love to see a metallic pewter snake because I think it would be awesome. $106.95 at &lt;a href="http://www.zappos.com/product/7479726/color/60123"&gt;Zappos&lt;/a&gt;. I think $106.95 is probably a sweet deal for something made out of metallic pewter snake because I imagine metallic pewter snakes are probably very rare.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[*****ADDED FOR CLARIFICATION: As the link above shows, these words are from a comment left on Pharyngula, not from its author.] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Mooney, you seem to have this bizarre notion that anyone here cares what you think, or what you have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you spend two chapters essentially telling one of the strongest voices of the pro-science movement that he’s a poopyhead who needs to sit down and shut up, even though he has evidence on your side, do you really think that he or those who think speaking out and up are going to heed what you have to say? To care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why–why–don’t you expect the stupid to educate itself, rather than telling people to pat stupid on the head and say, “there, there, I’m sorry if what I said hurt your feelings.” These people are screaming their heads off while smearing feces on the wall. “There there” will not change them. It only enables them, and usually makes them act up even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think it’s the responsibility of any scientist or pro-science ally to make people feel better. Fuck their feelings! Ridicule can work to make people educate themselves, especially when they are way past the age of being compelled into schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, well, this whole mindset is precisely what we wrote a book against. The &lt;em&gt;blame the public&lt;/em&gt; mindset. The &lt;em&gt;it’s not our fault, we’re the smart people&lt;/em&gt; mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undeniable reality of the situation is that the gap between scientists and the public is the fault of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;, and it won’t do to put the blame only on one side. Bridging the gap requires many things of the public, but also many things from scientists–among them some introspection about what has gone wrong these many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re quite confident that people who are ready to stop blaming the public or the religious, and start working &lt;em&gt;with them &lt;/em&gt;to try to change things, will like our book. And indeed, we have plenty of evidence of that. For instance, zip over to RealClimate, where &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/#comment-130276"&gt;somebody really gets it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Harold Lindsell dropped his bombshell of a book on us titled, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Battle-Bible-Harold-Lindsell/dp/0310276810/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1247150689&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Battle for the Bible&lt;/a&gt;, where he drew a line in the sand whereby evangelicals must accept inerrancy in order to stay evangelicals. Afterward all of us had to take a position on the matter. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is Price's dissertation finally in print about that era. There were five evangelical responses as he describes them. Each one of them opened the door to liberal thought, and he takes us through each one of them. Price argues that basically Lindsell was right. Once evangelicals denied inerrancy they were on a slippery slide to liberalism, but Lindsell was wrong in that the Bible is in fact errant, which led evangelicals to travel on this slippery slide in the first place. A history of evangelicals since that time proves that Price's predictions were correct. Evangelicals who denied inerrancy did indeed become more and more liberal. It's a good book and a very interesting read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In our own day a recent attempt to reformulate and question inerrancy is the book by &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1597528617?tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1597528617&amp;amp;adid=1FF8DNFK3ZHQ1DC72GCF&amp;amp;"&gt;Carlos R. Bovell&lt;/a&gt;. He's already given up the ship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also had the pleasure of meeting and talking with Bruce of "Bruce Droppings" &lt;a href="http://brucedroppings.com/2009/07/fort-wayne-free-thought/"&gt;who also wrote about last night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-5535566447657546634?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I had to take the bait when I read your blog post.  I am an atheist, and my boyfriend (who I live with) is Catholic. Normally, it is not an issue. He is not a devout Catholic, he never wants to go to mass, he doesn’t pray, he even told me he’s really not sure there is a god. However, he gets really offended if I say anything bad about Catholicism or religion and thinks I don’t need to be so outspoken about my atheism. I’m not really sure what to do as I see myself more as raising interesting and thought-provoking points and he sees it as an attack. I love my boyfriend very much and I don’t need him to be an atheist, but why is he so defensive about something he doesn’t even act like matters to him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nora
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Nora, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your statement and question are crystal clear.   If you haven’t yet, present them to him instead of me, but be certain to present it all in a way that helps him feel completely safe to answer honestly.  So much of communication is in the tone.  His answer might require some introspective effort on his part, so it might take some time, and might come in small installments. Be equal parts patient, loving and curious.  Approach his puzzling defensiveness as if it is an interesting quirk in a personality that you love, so you won’t inadvertently create the sense that you see it as a flaw.   Then he might become curious about it too, rather than becoming even more defensive about his defensiveness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond whatever he might say I can only speculate, and offhand I can think of five possibilities: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His family background might not have included the understanding that “interesting and thought-provoking” conversations can be non-adversarial, that they aren’t necessarily one person attacking another. Not all families know how to have such conversations. If this is the case, he might react as if it is an attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though he may even be not so sure about God, being Catholic for him may include some self identity, family identity and loyalty, cultural identity, sense of place and sense of tradition. If so, those things might trigger a defensive reaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another possibility is that it might not be defensiveness about his own beliefs, but instead it might be a less–than-conscious objection to your atheism.  He has been brought up in a society that sees atheism as ugly, evil, vulgar, disrespectful and dangerous.  His loving you as an individual may not have completely erased such negative feelings about a category of which you are a member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is the possibility that because of that stigma, he wants to avoid social embarrassment if your atheism is revealed to others, so he wishes you’d just not talk about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your arguments are strong and compelling, and he feels what little faith he has left giving way.  For emotional reasons, he doesn’t want to completely lose it.   Many atheists know how painful that process can be. So he wants you to back off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculations like these are more often wrong than right when I haven’t gotten to know the person, so the best expert to consult about him is him.  If you think any of the above possibilities might be correct, be careful to only propose them if he seems stuck and cannot find the insight he needs to answer your original question.  Again, the tone is important; present them as mere suggestions, not accusations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nora, he’s a lucky guy to have so loving and intelligent a girlfriend.  Intelligence sometimes makes the loving more complicated, but also can make it more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

Ella is &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;quoted in the Independent&lt;/a&gt; (something I somehow missed last time I looked at it) as having attended a swine flu party, so is this the first evidence that these parties have actually taken place? (HT: "sTeamTraen")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been to a swine flu party – but it didn't start out like that. It was a regular teenager's party until the conversation turned to swine flu and it turned out that my friend's boyfriend has it so it's likely that my friend, who is also 15, does as well. Everyone started laughing because the idea of a friend having swine flu was quite funny. It was one of those things that you hear about on the news and think will never affect you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the "swine flu party" started: a coughing fit from my friend all over everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, lovely. So to begin with, this wasn't actually a swine flu party, just a bunch of teenage girls - none of whom apparently have the flu - spontaneously coughing over each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ella isn't just some average kid they found; she has apparently been writing for the Independent since 2008, covering everything from &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/first-night-harry-potter-and-the-halfblood-prince-odeon-leicester-square-1736209.html"&gt;reviews of the latest Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt; to articles about &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/seven-ages-of-love/the-seven-ages-of-love-the-teenagers-view-942408.html"&gt;the teenage view of sex&lt;/a&gt; . Prior to that she appeared in &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1558082/Four-young-reviewers-give-their-verdicts.html"&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; aged just thirteen. It's a bit cynical to present her as an average kid who happens to have been involved in swine flu parties when neither part of that is really true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it's not fair to criticise Ella for this. The girl has talent, and anyone with the skill, talent and maturity to be writing for the national press in their early teens should be encouraged - she is undoubtedly a great kid. However, one has to question the ethics of the editor in using this sort of story. It's all too reminiscent of, well, this guy:&lt;/p&gt;

These aren't particularly accurate and should be taken with a pinch of salt, and the same pattern is not reflected in the United States, but they illustrate a worrying point. The graph at the bottom shows media mentions of swine flu parties in the United Kingdom over time, while the top graph shows search volume from British users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/viz.png" width="520"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
Broadly speaking then, it appears that much of the public's interest in swine flu parties, as crudely measured by Google search results, was prompted by coverage of the phenomenon in the media. This begs the question, to what extent did these parties exist prior to the media coverage of them? Did newspapers report the story, or create it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why these parties are such a bad idea should be pretty obvious - they involve deliberately making children ill, the majority of whom would never have been ill in the first place; and if enough people take part they cause the illness to spread much more rapidly through the population than it would otherwise. With vaccines not yet widely available and health workers racing to prepare ahead of the expected winter outbreak it's a particularly short-sighted approach to take, and of course there's no guarantee that little Tarquin will be immune anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response of the British government and media to swine flu has been generally &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/07/uk_health_minister_exponential.php"&gt;poor and dithering&lt;/a&gt;. Swine flu is a &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/04/parmageddon/"&gt;very genuine threat&lt;/a&gt;, but it's the sort of threat that's hard to convey to the public - possibly very dangerous but unpredictable, and likely to be slow moving for many months. Media coverage inevitably veered wildly between predicting "Parmageddon" and mocking the "scare-mongering". In the meantime, swine flu has spread, affecting several thousand people and killing a handful so far - children have been &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/06/three-deaths-swine-flu-uk"&gt;particularly vulnerable&lt;/a&gt;. The failure to contain the pandemic in the UK led to the government &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/02/swine-flu-uk"&gt;abandoning their containment strategy&lt;/a&gt; last week and adopting an aggressive treatment policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this background, the first mentions of swine flu parties appeared on Mumsnet.com, an internet forum frequented by middle class mothers. As the website's founder, Justine Roberts, &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;explained to &lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there was no evidence that any parties had been arranged, merely a discussion of &lt;i&gt;"the principle of whether it might be a good idea."&lt;/i&gt; Roberts gave an odd defense of this thinking &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;in &lt;i&gt;The Independent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ms Roberts said she believed parents had become confused by the Government's policy of keeping schools open while at the same time telling them to take all precautions against their children contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;'No one wants to cause hysteria,&lt;/i&gt; she said. &lt;i&gt;'The Government has an agenda, I assume, about having to control the infection, but the truth of the matter is either you should get it now or try to avoid getting it – you can't have it both ways. It's so easy to give a glib representation of ignorant parents who are acting hysterically.'&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, I imagine, took the view that mass closures of schools that would be breaking up for the summer soon anyway, during exam periods, would be going to far, but what I don't understand is how the suggestion that people should continue to go about their ordinary lives, while remaining vigilant, is somehow morphed into &lt;i&gt;"you should get it now."&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, at the time of writing I've seen no evidence whatsoever that any such parties have actually taken place. The entire story seems to be based on claims from a person promoting a parenting website that the idea has been discussed on an internet forum. In short, it was a non-story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet on the basis of this non-story, Roberts was interviewed by national newspapers, mentioned in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1908407,00.html"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and appeared on radio shows to 'debate' public health policy with health professionals. In the &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/warning-over-swine-flu-parties-plan-1726195.html"&gt;Independent article&lt;/a&gt; I cited earlier, a website owner is given 4 paragraphs in which to state their views, while the Government's chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson, representing the views of basically the entire British medical profession, gets just two and a bit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course there is a case for reporting and addressing the concerns of parents. Doubtless government advice can be confusing (and at times confused), and so responsible coverage of the issues involved is a Good Thing. The problem is that, as far as I and others who have researched this can make out, swine flu parties don't exist. Far from addressing the issue, Roberts is being given a vast platform on which to promote it (and of course her website). In all probability the vast majority of parents had never even heard of or considered the idea before it burst into the newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the story of the swine flu parties was never real, but there's a certain relentlessness about the largely unconscious creation of the media myth. There's no reason to believe that at any stage people made things up - rather a grain of truth was shaped and polished and embellished in a machine that seems to run on autopilot. The result is a fusion of fact and myth that exists in its own reality, and yet - if the rough results from Google Trends are anything to go by - is beginning to distort our own. By the end of the summer, the story could well be real, and if it is then it will have been created by the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They took an embryo donated from an in vitro fertlization (IVF) clinic and they incubated the embryo, allowing it to grow and divide. They were able to tag the germline cells, those destined to become sperm, and separate those. They were able to coax them into meiosis, forming mature adult sperm cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same group &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/5166462.stm"&gt;accomplished the same feat with mice in 2006&lt;/a&gt;. Now for the first time they have applied their technique to a human embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting advance in ESC technology. The obvious application of this specific technology would be in treating male infertility. However, using ESC would not be useful for this application. The donated embryo would be the father of any children resulting from sperm grown with this method. And of course if a man has a fertility problem, they could not have donated the sperm to make the embryo in the first place, and if they could they wouldn’t need this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a technique like this to be a treatment for male infertility, they would have to grow the sperm from adult-derived stem cells, not ESC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6547675.stm"&gt;separate team in Germany &lt;/a&gt;working on just that. Researchers from the Universities of Göttingen and Münster and the Medical School of Hannover created sperm from adult-derived stem cells obtained from bone marrow. However, these sperm were not fully motile. The researchers said at the time, in April of 2007, that they will need 5 years or so to perfect their technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another &lt;a href="http://www.vetscite.org/publish/items/003863/index.html"&gt;team at Cornell University&lt;/a&gt; have been trying to clone sperm as a potential treatment for low sperm count. They injected a single mouse sperm into a mouse egg whose DNA had been removed, and were able to clone the sperm. However, mice resulting from the cloned sperm were abnormal. The researches conceded that their technique is still in its infancy. The researchers report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, 13 mice have been born using the method, of which four survived to adulthood and produced offspring of their own. The technique is a long way from perfect, Palermo and Takeuchi admit. The researchers implanted more than 80 embryos, and of those that did survive to full term, several died soon after birth. It is not clear whether the technique would work for human sperm, in which cell division is more complex. Palermo estimates that each sperm could yield no more than eight clones, because allowing the cells to replicate more than three times could mean that the sperm DNA stops expressing male-specific genes. And the cloned sperm are spherical. Lacking the tails that normal sperm use to swim, they are suitable only for test-tube fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So at the very least we have three teams, in the UK, Germany, and the US – working on different techniques to create sperm as a potential treatment for male infertility. All groups are at an early stage in their research and saying they need about another 5 years to perfect their techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we will just have to wait and see. These seem like incremental advances, although important ones. Stem cell researchers are slowly improving their ability to control embryos and stem cells and make them do what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, another theme throughout all of this research is that the resulting sperm, or mice resulting from them, are not quite normal. The techniques used seem to cause damage or abnormalities in the resulting sperm. Also, the process of meiosis in humans is more complex than in mice and therefore this is likely to be more of a problem when applied to humans.  The researchers are optimistic (almost a necessity in anyone dependent upon funding) but we really don’t know how long it will take to work out the technical problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">NeuroLogica Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247139416234"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/09/francis-collins-to-head-nih/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/657474646c96379e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics and Science"/><category term="Science and Religion"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">Francis Collins to Head NIH</title><published>2009-07-09T10:19:45Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T10:19:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/09/francis-collins-to-head-nih/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/health/policy/09nih.html?ref=health"&gt;reports &lt;/a&gt;that some raised the issue that he is religious and very public with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are two basic objections to Dr. Collins. The first is his very public embrace of religion. He wrote a book called “The Language of God,” and he has given many talks and interviews in which he described his conversion to Christianity as a 27-year-old medical student. Religion and genetic research have long had a fraught relationship, and some in the field complain about what they see as Dr. Collins’s evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do those complaining think that his “evangelism” will affect his ability to do a good job at NIH? Because if not, I fail to see how this is a relevant criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is non-supernaturalism being proposed as a criterion for holding a high level science policy position? That would be still more problematic, especially in light of very valid attacks on the last administration for vetting science policy appointees based on politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I’m glad of the choice. It elevates to new prominence someone who merges top tier science with religion–a powerful way to show that you really can have both in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I can only guess what others will think.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Great Collins quote from a &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1211593,00.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine profile&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses at the outset on Collins’ defense of evolutionary science: “I think the majority of people in the U.S. probably occupy a middle ground but feel under attack by the bombs thrown from either side. We haven’t heard very much about the way these views can be rendered into a very satisfying harmony. And I do hope that both camps are a potential audience for what I have to say.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247138470253"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/07/things-i-didnt-know-before-pastor-anderson-brought-them-to-my-attention-eroding-civil-liberties-vers.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7fed9ea842a19068</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cultural Criticism"/><title type="html">Things I Didn't Know Before Pastor Anderson Brought Them To My Attention: Eroding Civil Liberties Version</title><published>2009-07-09T10:01:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T10:01:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/07/things-i-didnt-know-before-pastor-anderson-brought-them-to-my-attention-eroding-civil-liberties-vers.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;What I have learned thanks to Pastor Anderson:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://blog.aclu.org/2008/10/22/homeland-security-assuming-broad-powers-turning-vast-swaths-of-us-into-constitution-free-zone/"&gt;Constitution free zone&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;in the United States&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://epic.org/privacy/fusion/default.html#background"&gt;fusion center&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; is, and how &lt;a href="http://blog.aclu.org/2009/04/08/fusion-centers-listen-to-us-already/"&gt;they threaten our liberties&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/gen/32966pub20071205.html"&gt;What&amp;#39;s Wrong With Fusion Centers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we need a s&lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/natsec/gen/38798res20090224.html"&gt;trong ACLU now more than ever &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been a &amp;quot;card-carrying member&amp;quot; of ACLU, but I will be now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I think that &lt;a href="http://www.faithfulwordbaptist.org/index.html"&gt;Pastor Anderson&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href="http://stevenandersonfamily.blogspot.com/"&gt;Zsuzssana &lt;/a&gt;are creepy, in a fundamentalist, dogmatic,  hate-filled way.


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Pastor Anderson fell afoul of the law because....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, as the ACLU says, Pastor Anderson was in a &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/37293res20081022.html"&gt;Constitution Free Zone&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;#39;t as &lt;a href="http://www.sanjuanislander.com/federal/border-patrol/searches.shtml"&gt;compliant as the Border Patrol requires&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.sddt.com/commentary/article.cfm?Commentary_ID=109&amp;amp;SourceCode=20081212tza"&gt;Thomas Elias&lt;/a&gt; explained, the  &lt;a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/cwr/87719.htm"&gt;Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952&lt;/a&gt;  (which has been found constitutional many times) grants to the &lt;a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/"&gt;Border Patrol&lt;/a&gt;  the authority to set up checkpoints and stop traffic anywhere&lt;strong&gt; within 100 miles of any U.S. border.  &lt;/strong&gt;Following 9/11, there&amp;#39;s been a huge buildup of manpower by the BP in many reagions across the United States. According to Elias&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The bottom line: The Border Patrol&amp;#39;s increased manpower means almost anyone can be stopped and searched almost anywhere [within 100 miles of the US Border]. And any agent doing this would most likely be operating entirely within both the law and the patrol&amp;#39;s rules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

On the Olympic Peninsula, the Border Patrol has expanded operations, leading to the formation of a local activist group: &lt;a href="http://www.bpfree.org/index.html"&gt;Border Patrol Free&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/393668_border26.html"&gt;ACLU of Washington State is planning to sue&lt;/a&gt; the Border Patrol for civil rights violations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/privacy/37293res20081022.html"&gt;ACLU Fact Sheet on U.S. &amp;quot;Constitution Free Zone&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Normally under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the American people are not generally subject to random and arbitrary stops and searches. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; The border, however, has always been an exception. There, the longstanding view is that the normal rules do not apply. For example the authorities do not need a warrant or probable cause to conduct a “routine search.” &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * But what is “the border”? According to the government, it is a 100-mile wide strip that wraps around the “external boundary” of the United States. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * As a result of this claimed authority, individuals who are far away from the border, American citizens traveling from one place in America to another, are being stopped and harassed in ways that our Constitution does not permit.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * Border Patrol has been setting up checkpoints inland — on highways in states such as California, Texas and Arizona, and at ferry terminals in Washington State. Typically, the agents ask drivers and passengers about their citizenship. Unfortunately, our courts so far have permitted these kinds of checkpoints – legally speaking, they are “administrative” stops that are permitted only for the specific purpose of protecting the nation’s borders. They cannot become general drug-search or other law enforcement efforts. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * However, these stops by Border Patrol agents are not remaining confined to that border security purpose. On the roads of California and elsewhere in the nation – places far removed from the actual border – agents are stopping, interrogating, and searching Americans on an everyday basis with absolutely no suspicion of wrongdoing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * The bottom line is that the extraordinary authorities that the government possesses at the border are spilling into regular American streets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Much of U.S. population affected
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * Many Americans and Washington policymakers believe that this is a problem confined to the San Diego-Tijuana border or the dusty sands of Arizona or Texas, but these powers stretch far inland across the United States. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * To calculate what proportion of the U.S. population is affected by these powers, the ACLU created a map and spreadsheet showing the population and population centers that lie within 100 miles of any “external boundary” of the United States. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * The population estimates were calculated by examining the most recent US census numbers for all counties within 100 miles of these borders. Using numbers from the Population Distribution Branch of the US Census Bureau, we were able to estimate both the total number and a state-by-state population breakdown. The custom map was created with help from a map expert at World Sites Atlas.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * What we found is that fully TWO-THIRDS of the United States’ population lives within this Constitution-free or Constitution-lite Zone. That’s 197.4 million people who live within 100 miles of the US land and coastal borders. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * Nine of the top 10 largest metropolitan areas as determined by the 2000 census, fall within the Constitution-free Zone. (The only exception is #9, Dallas-Fort Worth.) Some states are considered to lie completely within the zone: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Part of a broader problem
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * The spread of border-search powers inland is part of a broad expansion of border powers with the potential to affect the lives of ordinary Americans who have never left their own country. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * It coincides with the development of numerous border technologies, including watch list and database systems such as the Automated Targeting System (ATS) traveler risk assessment program, identity and tracking systems such as electronic (RFID) passports, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), and intrusive technological schemes such as the Secure Border Initiative Network (SBINet) or “virtual border fence” and unmanned aerial vehicles (aka “drone aircraft”). &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * This illegitimate expansion of the extraordinary powers of agents at the border is also part of a general trend we have seen over the past 8 years of an untrammeled, heedless expansion of police and national security powers without regard to the effect on innocent Americans.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; * This trend is also typical of the Bush Administration’s dragnet approach to law enforcement and national security. Instead of intelligent, competent, targeted efforts to stop terrorism, illegal immigration, and other crimes, what we have been seeing in area after area is an approach that turns us all into suspects. This approach seeks to sift through the entire U.S. population in the hopes of encountering the rare individual whom the authorities have a legitimate interest in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
If the current generation of Americans does not challenge this creeping (and sometimes galloping) expansion of federal powers over the individual through the rationale of “border protection,” we are not doing our part to keep alive the rights and freedoms that we inherited, and will soon find that we have lost some or all of their right to go about their business, and travel around inside their own country, without interference from the authorities.

They’re back on, now!  Sorry for the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norma McCorvey&lt;/strong&gt; was once known as “Jane Roe” in the &lt;em&gt;Roe vs. Wade&lt;/em&gt; Supreme Court case that legalized abortion throughout the country.  For years, she was proud to be pro-choice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you may know that that’s no longer the case.  McCorvey now works with extremely religious pro-life groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/07/norma-mccorvey-abortion-america"&gt;fascinating article about her transition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here’s what McCorvey wrote in 1994, when she was proud to be Jane Roe, a supporter of the women’s rights she helped to attain: “All over the country the anti-choice fanatics are still at work, still trying to inflict their own religious views on others, still trying to hide their anti-woman feelings, still trying to keep us from controlling our own bodies and our own lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet here is McCorvey today, on the steps of the supreme court where those rights were laid down: “These steps are covered in blood! ‘Equal justice under the law’ — what crock! If there is no right for a child to be born, there is no justice at all.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I was really interested in reading about when exactly she made the change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When her book came out in 1994 [Operation Rescue members] picketed her signings, shouting at her that she was responsible for the deaths of 35 million unborn babies. &lt;strong&gt;Then Operation Rescue took out a lease on the house next door to the abortion clinic where McCorvey worked. They began talking to her, befriending her, offering her lunch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I started watching the rescuers and wondering what makes them tick. They were down to earth, they weren’t telling me I was going to fry in hell, though I’m sure they were thinking that. They were very kind to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly, they turned her ideas around. In August 1995 she allowed herself to be baptised in a backyard swimming pool in Dallas. Three years later, she took her first Catholic mass.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main question wasn’t answered.  I feel like there must’ve been some point, some moment, when what they said tipped her thinking to the other side.  I don’t know what they said but I’m curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that her transition happened over time — that’s how it happened for me regarding atheism — but reading the article, she seems very impressionable.  One reasonable pro-life argument may have been all that was needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you became an atheist, was it due to one particular thing you heard or read?  Or was it due to a collection of several different thoughts going through your mind over a period of time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard because we can’t go anywhere,” says a tearful Marty Kelly. “We can’t have anyone over – he just screams all day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this story before. It’s the Warrior Mother narrative, parents fighting the odds and persevering against a heartless medical establishment that just doesn’t get it. Warrior Mothers hold a special power over news reporters – they can say or do just about anything and the hapless journalist dutifully reports. The same reporter who  question a city council person’s expense report becomes an obsequious stenographer when facing the Warrior Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because Warrior Mothers are fighters. Marty Kelly, we learn, was in denial about her son’s autism for three years before she snapped out of it and bought a hyperbaric oxygen chamber which, according to WABI, produced “great results.” If WABI had actually investigated Kelly’s claims,  we would hear that hyperbaric oxygen has never been proven safe and effective for autism. But such details would only displease Warrior Mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfied with mere great results, the Kellys will now expose their son to a third-world alternative medical clinic, and a treatment that is not only unproven, but potentially dangerous. But hey, Warrior Mother has spoken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of research, Marty came across Adult Stem Cell Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stem cells go into the body, find the damaged areas, and begin to form new working blood vessels that carry oxygen and rejuvenate the damaged tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy is not done in the United States. They will take Kenneth to Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It feels as though, yes there is hope and yes, truly he will become a normal boy that will face challenges that we all face as adults.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So intimidating is Warrior Mother that our young reporter neglected to seek out an expert for a second opinion on stem cell therapy for autism. If she had, she would have learned that people with autism do not have “damaged tissue”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick, a general practitioner and father to a child with autism, coverered this ground in &lt;em&gt;Defeating Autism: A Damaging Delusion&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summer 2007 a review article entitled ‘Stem cell therapy for autism’ was published in an obscure journal, stimulating a flurry of international publicity (Ichim et al 2007). The authors, based in a biotech company in Arizona and in a clinic in Costa Rica, propose treating autistic children with a combination of stem cells derived from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood cells. Before long reports appeared in the US press that children with autism were being brought by their parents to Mexico and China to get stem cell treatments (which are illegal in the USA – and Britain) at enormous expense. Another autism treatment craze was underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stem cell craze has all the familiar features of the treatment fads that have afflicted the world of autism, with many of the distinctive characteristics of the biomedical approach. The promise that stem cells, cells which retain the primitive capacity to divide and differentiate into specialised cell types, will deliver treatments for hitherto intractable diseases has beguiled medical science for decades. Though there have been some achievements, such as the use of bone marrow stem cells in the form of ‘transplants’ to treat leukaemia, progress has been slow and the clinical yield disappointing. The theoretically more promising – and more controversial – area of embryonic stem cell research has so far produced no clinical benefits. While serious research continues, entrepreneurs have promoted stem cell treatments for a wide range of conditions, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and many more, far in advance of any rational therapeutics. The quest by biotech companies for a wider market for stem cells has led them to take a growing interest in treating autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no coherent scientific rationale for stem cell treatment in autism, though Thomas Ichim and his colleagues attempt to provide one – or at least they disguise its absence with a barrage of quasi-scientific jargon accompanied by hundreds of references. They speculate that autism is caused by ‘neural hypoperfusion’ and associated with ‘immune dysregulation’ and chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. They claim that stem cells and cord blood can stimulate new blood vessel formation (‘angiogenesis’ – biomedics prefer Latin) and correct the immune and inflammatory problems. But there is no good evidence of a deficient blood supply to the brain in autism, nor any consistent pattern of immune dysfunction. It is scarcely necessary to add that there is no evidence whatever that stem cell treatment is effective in autism – or that it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following secretin, the pancreatic hormone that was hailed as a wonder cure in 1998, and before that holding therapy, facilitated communication and auditory integration therapy, stem cell treatment will attract desperate parents and, inevitably, lead them and their children to disappointment (Fitzpatrick 2004: 78-84).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; problems with putting stem cells into someone &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they have developed organs is that the signals necessary to direct organ creation have been turned off. The bio-medical entrepreneurs in Costa Rica are hoping that the stem cells will somehow get enough signal to develop properly and not – for instance – start making liver cells in the middle of young Kenneth’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that worth mentioning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t live in Michigan long without running into a building, or project, or &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that is named after &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Keith_Kellogg"&gt;W.K. Kellogg&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Kellogg cereal company and major &lt;a href="http://www.wkkf.org/Default.aspx?LanguageID=0"&gt;philanthropist&lt;/a&gt;. It’s his brother, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, who is really the interesting one, though.&lt;img title="kellogg" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/kellogg.jpg?w=112&amp;amp;h=150" alt="kellogg" width="112" height="150"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kellogg was profiled in the book and movie &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111001/"&gt;The Road to Wellville&lt;/a&gt;. In the movie, Anthony Hopkins delivers an inspired performance of Kellogg as a…well, pretty much total nutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins didn’t exaggerate all that much. Dr. Kellogg was ahead of his time in terms of some of his ideas about nutrition and health. He just always managed to &lt;a title="Spinal Tap!!" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to_eleven"&gt;take them to 11&lt;/a&gt; in terms of strangeness, and threw in some General Jack Ripper’s theories on &lt;a title="Video from Dr. Strangelove" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY"&gt;pollution of our precious bodily fluids&lt;/a&gt; for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kellogg’s ideas are nicely profiled in the essay “&lt;a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/electronic-publications/stay-free/10/graham.htm"&gt;Porn Flakes&lt;/a&gt;.” What we know &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; as ubiquitous foods–graham crackers and cold flaked cereal–actually are related to fears of masturbation and religious dietary edicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all begins with Sister Ellen White, founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/sda1.htm"&gt;Seventh Day Adventists&lt;/a&gt;. In the late 1860’s, &lt;a title="on a map" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=battle+creek+michigan&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;split=0&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;ei=b808SsC0JIy2Ns-tlZ0C&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;amp;ct=title&amp;amp;resnum=1"&gt;Battle Creek&lt;/a&gt; was home to the headquarters of the Adventists, and a vision (?) inspired White to found &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Health_Reform_Institute"&gt;The Western Health Reform Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which became known as the Battle Creek Sanitarium.  The sanitarium treated the ‘Illness’ of being a upper-class American in the late 1800’s: too much food and a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="granose" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/granose.jpg?w=175&amp;amp;h=175" alt="granose" width="175" height="175"&gt;Dr. Kellogg became the manager for the Sanitarium, and advocated the principles of his church as the Road to Wellness: no meat, lots of water, and exercise.  (In fact, Kellogg could legitimately claim to have invented the aerobics class: exercise to music.  Legwarmers were not developed until later, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where things go odd.  It wasn’t just &lt;em&gt;drinking&lt;/em&gt; water he pushed; Kellogg also was a major enema advocate.  One of his inventions was an enema machine that could deliver 15 gallons of water in a single sitting (so to speak).  Water enemas were followed by yogurt–half eaten, the other half delivered below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellogg is profiled in the book &lt;a href="http://www.santamonicapress.com/index.php?page_name=quack&amp;amp;page_type=book&amp;amp;show=desc&amp;amp;hide0=excerpt&amp;amp;hide1=author&amp;amp;hide2=reviews&amp;amp;hide5=number5"&gt;Quack&lt;/a&gt;! in part because of his invention of a shaking machine.  This vibratory chair was designed to prevent constipation by, literally,  &lt;em&gt;shaking the shit out of the patient&lt;/em&gt;.   He also invented &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/patents?id=SPFeAAAAEBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=drawing&amp;amp;zoom=4#PPA1917,M1"&gt;an Electkothekapeutical Chair&lt;/a&gt; (that is not a typo) to stimulate your innards.  (If you really NEED to know more, you can read his 1915 book &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OmwPAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;dq=John+harvey+kellogg+mechanical+chair&amp;amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s"&gt;Colon Hygiene&lt;/a&gt; online via Google Books.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; did you need a squeaky clean colon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellogg’s 1881 sex education book &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19924/19924-h/19924-h.htm"&gt;Plain Facts for Old and Young&lt;/a&gt; explains. Food was related to sexual desire, and and too much sex (i.e, &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sex) created poor health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;” Sexual precocity, idleness, pernicious literature, abnormal sexual passions, &lt;strong&gt;exciting and irritating food, gluttony, &lt;/strong&gt;sedentary employment, libidinous pictures, and many abnormal conditions of life, are potent causes in exciting the vile practice…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After long abuse of the sexual organs, and in many cases after a short course of sin, the whole system becomes deteriorated; &lt;strong&gt;digestion is impaired, the muscles are weakened&lt;/strong&gt;, the circulation is unbalanced, the nerves are irritable, the brain—especially the back and lower portion of it—is congested, the skin is torpid, &lt;strong&gt;the bowels are inactive&lt;/strong&gt;, the general health is deranged in almost every particular.” &lt;/em&gt;(emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, sex was bad, and sex made you sick. Meat was bad, and meat made you think of sex. Sex was bad….well, you begin to see the cycle.  Granola eating and enemas were a way to purify yourself, in addition to, of course, not having any sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kellogg reputedly never had sex his entire life–I’ll leave his obsession with things anal and oral for you to analyze on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Kellogg’s ideas for ‘curing’ the problem of sex were &lt;a title="I LOVE HISTORY HOUSE" href="http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/cereal/"&gt;pretty extreme&lt;/a&gt;.  That would include (from the same book I quoted above) circumcision of masturbating boys without any anesthesia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;” The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anesthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And..well… for women:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In females, the author has found the application of pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent means of allaying the abnormal excitement.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all of you are probably clutching your groin right now, I’ll leave the story of Dr. Kellogg’s &lt;a title="including sterilizations" href="http://www.uvm.edu/%7Elkaelber/eugenics/MI/MI.html"&gt;Eugenics boosterism&lt;/a&gt; for another time.  I just find Dr. Kellogg fascinating and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe you missed them in high school or college, maybe you just never felt like taking the plunge and learning them on your own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That certainly applies to me. Although I like to flatter myself with the term polymath, “jack of all trades” is perhaps more honest. I know just enough to be dangerous on too many subjects, and wish I knew more about all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I was so excited about (cue the cheesy TV commercial music) the &lt;em&gt;Manga Guides,&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href="http://nostarch.com/"&gt;No Starch Press&lt;/a&gt;. Having grown up with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Battleship_Yamato"&gt;Space Cruiser Yamato&lt;/a&gt; and being a hardcore &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotech"&gt;Robotech&lt;/a&gt; fan, I’m more than willing to give an anime or manga guide to anything a fair shake.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No Starch publishes a whole range of &lt;em&gt;Manga Guides:&lt;/em&gt; databases, calculus, electricity, even molecular biology (I want to read that one next). They sent me the &lt;em&gt;Manga Guide to Statistics&lt;/em&gt; by Shin Takahashi and the &lt;em&gt;Manga Guide to Physics&lt;/em&gt; by Hideo Nitta and Keita Takatsu. Each book blends a basic education in science with a simple tale. For example, in the statistics guide, a little girl has to learn lessons in statistics in order to win the attention of a young engineer at her father’s company. If you’re going to be a budding stalker, at least do it with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style="width:164px"&gt;&lt;img title="Manga Guide to Statistics" src="http://nostarch.com/images/mg_statistics_cov.jpg" alt="Manga Guide to Statistics" width="154" height="204"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manga Guide to Statistics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The science is introductory level, but it’s not dumbed down. If you read the stories carefully you will pick up a decent working knowledge, no prerequisites necessary. Especially if you have a genuine enthusiasm for the material, the &lt;em&gt;Manga Guides&lt;/em&gt; are effective learning tools. Although the concept seems juvenile, learning the lessons in the context of a real-world story is actually quite effective. They’re great for a kid, although the more advanced topics might well be over the head of a young child; and I’m rocking and rolling to them too, and I’m young only at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t need to become a Ph.D. but you do want to have a good working knowledge of the topics discussed by your favorite science bloggers and podcasters, you could do a lot worse than to pick up a copy of the &lt;em&gt;Manga Guide to Physics&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Manga Guide to Statistics.&lt;/em&gt; No Starch Press distributes through O’Reilly, so the books are available pretty much everywhere on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Brian Dunning</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepticblog.org/feed/</id><title type="html">Skepticblog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.skepticblog.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247127989926"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=554">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee44d46776b7adec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clinical Trials"/><category term="Health Fraud"/><category term="Medical Ethics"/><category term="Politics and Regulation"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><category term="$30 Million"/><category term="atherosclerosis"/><category term="cardiology"/><category term="Chelation Therapy"/><category term="Dan Burton"/><category term="Felons"/><category term="Felony"/><category term="fraud"/><category term="NCCAM"/><category term="NHLBI"/><category term="politics"/><category term="TACT"/><category term="Tom Harkin"/><category term="treatment"/><title type="html">NIH Awards $30 Million Research Dollars To Convicted Felons: Cliff’s Notes Version</title><published>2009-07-09T08:00:58Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T08:00:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=554" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you’re coming late to this discussion (or have ADD), I’ve summarized &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625"&gt;Dr. Kimball Atwood’s terrific analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the ongoing clinical trial (TACT trial) in which convicted felons were awarded $30 million by the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the most &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625"&gt;unethical clinical trial debacles of our time&lt;/a&gt;, the NIH approved a research study (called the TACT Trial - Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy - a supposed treatment for arteriosclerosis) in which the treatment had no evidence for potential benefit, and clear evidence of potential harm - and even the risk of death. Amazingly, the researchers neglected to mention this risk in their informed consent document. The NIH awarded $30 million of our tax dollars to ~100 researchers to enroll 2000 patients in this risky study (ongoing from 2003-present). Even more astounding is the fact that several of the researchers have been disciplined for substandard practices by state medical boards; several have been involved in insurance fraud; at least 3 are convicted felons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment under investigation, IV injection of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;EDTA, is specifically contraindicated for “generalized arteriosclerosis” by the FDA. There have been over 30 reported cases of accidental death caused by the administration of this drug - and prior to the TACT, 4 RCTs and several substudies of chelation for either CAD or PVD, involving 285 subjects, had been reported.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;None found chelation superior to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, Why Was This Study Approved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH and the TACT principal investigator (PI) argued that there was a substantial demand for chelation, creating a “public health imperative” to perform a large trial as soon as possible. In reality, the number of people using the therapy was only a small fraction of what the PI reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know exactly what happened “behind the scenes” to pressure NIH to go forward with the study - however &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625_5"&gt;a few things are clear&lt;/a&gt;: 1) the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) initially declined to approve the study based on lack of scientific merit 2) congressman &lt;a href="http://burton.house.gov/"&gt;Dan Burton&lt;/a&gt; and at least one of his staffers (Beth Clay) and a lobbyist (Bill Chatfield) worked tirelessly to get the study approved through a different institute - NCCAM 3) some of the evidence used to support the trial was falsified (The RFA cited several articles by Edward McDonagh, the chelationist who had previously admitted in a court of law to having falsified his data.) 4) The NIH Special Emphasis Panel that approved the TACT protocol included L. Terry Chappell, whom the protocol had named as a participant in the TACT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All evidence seems to suggest that political meddling managed to trump science in this case - putting the lives of 2000 study subjects at risk, without any likely benefit to them or medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A formal analysis of the sordid history and ethical violations of the TACT trial was published by the &lt;em&gt;Medscape Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on May 13, 2008. &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625"&gt;Atwood et al.&lt;/a&gt; provide a rigorous, 9-part commentary with 326 references in review of the case. Congressman Burton’s staffer, Beth Clay, published what is essentially a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=534"&gt;character assassination&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Atwood &lt;a href="http://www.jpands.org/vol14no2/clay.pdf"&gt;in response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NIH Writes TACT Investigators a Strongly Worded Letter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 27, 2009 the Office for Human Research Protections Committee &lt;a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/YR09/may09b.pdf"&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; to the investigators of TACT, stating that they found, “multiple instances of substandard practices, insurance fraud, and felony activity on the part of the investigators.” The letter describes a list of irregularities and recommends various changes to the research protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost unheard of for a letter from the NIH to state that research study investigators are guilty of fraud and felony activity - but what I don’t understand is why they haven’t shut down the study. Perhaps this is their first step towards that goal? Let’s hope so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TACT trial has subjected 2000 unwary subjects and $30 million of public money to an unethical trial of a dubious treatment that, had it been accurately represented and judged by the usual criteria, would certainly have been disqualified. Political meddling in health and medical affairs is dangerous business, and must be opposed as strongly as possible. Congressmen like &lt;a href="http://www.getbetterhealth.com/why-non-scientists-should-not-direct-scientific-efforts-senator-harkins-misguided-beliefs-exposed/2009.03.02"&gt;Tom Harkin&lt;/a&gt; and Dan Burton should not be allowed to push their political agendas and requests for publicly funded pseudoscience on the NIH. I can only hope that the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=549"&gt;new NIH director&lt;/a&gt; will have the courage to fend off demands for unethical trials from political appointees.&lt;/p&gt;

Stiff as a board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Charlie was much younger and didn't want to go wherever we were going, he'd arch his back so hard that---like that proverbial board---there was no way we could debend him. Often Jim and I found ourselves each holding one of his hands as he, in essence, swung between us (the back-arching also seemed to involve curling up his feet). I'll admit that we felt pretty bad to be dragging (carrying) our little boy; we had to marvel at the strength of his arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those early days of parenting Charlie, I guess you could say we were forever &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/pulling_with_control"&gt;pulling with force rather than with control&lt;/a&gt;. We were both pretty new to parenting when Charlie was &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;diagnosed with autism in July of 1999&lt;/a&gt; (is that why I'm remember those days, because it's now been almost &lt;i&gt;ten years&lt;/i&gt;?). (I just remembered how we spent that hot Fourth of July in Minnesota---we drove out to the suburbs west of Minneapolis and Charlie made a memorable dash into Lake Excelsior and of course I hadn't brought any extra clothes; he conked out on the way home then was awake far into the hot night.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As each day passed, Charlie seemed more and more insistent on doing things &lt;i&gt;a certain way and one way only&lt;/i&gt;. Notably, when walking down the path from the front steps of our duplex to the sidewalk, he would, could, only go right. Attempts to lead, pull, and carry him to go left resulted in screams of an ear-curdling sort (and, it just occurred to me, of a sort that he himself &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_fireworks_for_our_4th"&gt;would not tolerate&lt;/a&gt; these days), more back-arching, and the like. We gradually learned one reason for Charlie's insistence on right not left: On the street to the right was a low stone wall whose intricate patterning Charlie would have spent hours pacing back and forth before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've since learned that Charlie is certainly &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/aac_again_beyond_words"&gt;drawn to such patterns&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes creates his own as a sort of communication. Back then in the spring and summer of 1999, we felt simply helpless and stuck with Charlie in a box with rigid sides and no openings. Sometimes we felt like we'd never be able to walk beyond that old stone wall. And, as the days passed, even standing in front of the stone wall---what Charlie seemed to be indicating he wanted to do---made him no more happy or at ease then turning left down the path; he was agitated, weepy, unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we learned how to help Charlie move through and beyond these rituals, even while (1) seeing how we ourselves are in need of some of our own routines and rituals (morning coffee.....) and (2) realizing that his &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/an-idea-of-order/"&gt;need for order&lt;/a&gt; and routine is as much a strength. Indeed, as parents of a child on the spectrum, we frequently find ourselves trying to balance between &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_same_old_same_old"&gt;the same old same old&lt;/a&gt; and gently &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/pulling_with_control"&gt;pulling Charlie forward&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking a lot about these things while Charlie was home full-time with Jim and me, on a break between school and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/summertime"&gt;Extended School Year&lt;/a&gt; (ESY). He's very reliant on his day being meted out half (plus) in school and half at home and so, lest the past two weeks feel like a chaos of uncertainty, I made up picture schedules galore (bless the powers of word processing, my iPhone camera, and the internet---where once I poured over magazines, catalogues, and picture books to find photos for Charlie's flashcards and schedules, now good old Google and that camera make it possible to find a photo of pretty much anything). I made weekly schedules, I made daily schedules. We did social stories. We made sure Charlie had his favorite comfort objects around (yes, sometimes I think the whole point of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;going to Greece&lt;/a&gt; was to discover &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/worry_beads"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;---Charlie's favorite are round and a muted olive jade green). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were still some figurative "fireworks" and especially in the second week, as the newness of Home All The Time! wore off. That second week, Charlie's need for extreme order---the rigidity---increased and Jim found his and Charlie's bike rides becoming increasingly anxiety-ridden, with Charlie insistent on them going &lt;i&gt;a certain way&lt;/i&gt; and over a certain bridge with no shoulder and regular traffic, and peddling out too far in the street, with the result that cars honked and drivers made "comments" (and Jim got really exasperated). Barking dogs and motorcycles did not help (though I guess it says something that motorists and motorcyclists alike don't think that Charlie isn't just another 12-year-old boy on his bike, and not a child in need of some extra accommodations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Charlie's own rage for order seemed to be too much to him at times. Twice last week he got off his bike on the busy bridge and Jim had to think fast on his feet, and wheels; a couple times I rushed to grab my bag and drove the black car, now a true "support vehicle," to wherever Jim and Charlie were. (I never actually found myself at the scene of the anxiety, which tended to peak and subside in a few minutes, and then I'd see the two of them home, sweaty and thirsty.) And I thought about how, you know where you're eating something really good like, an ice cream sundae or, I don't know, Peking duck (well, not me, because I'm a longtime vegetarian; I really am digressing) or maybe a substance more potent, and you keep having more, and wanting to have more, and thinking that having more has got to be better, it tastes so good, and then you're beyond the satiation point and feel.......nauseous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using this food analogy because Charlie's been funny about food the past couple of weeks. He's called routinely as ever for "burgers" and diners and, more often than not, gotten upset after we've had some very pleasant dinners. Sure, the food could not be agreeing with him, but we also have noticed that he's often not even eaten the better part of his burger and even left some French fries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's language is, as I've regularly noted, very limited. We tend not only to be very attuned to whatever words he says, but to put a great deal of store into whatever few words he says. And sometimes, I've been suspecting that Charlie gets caught up in his own words, and that the few words that he can remember to say on a regular basis often don't fully catch the essence, the subtleties, that he's trying to articulate. This is most apparent in his use of "&lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/yes-no-brown-noodles/"&gt;no&lt;/a&gt;," which really often seems to mean several other things than "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/words_arent_all_theyre_cracked_up_to_be"&gt;no&lt;/a&gt;" from "maybe" to "not now" to "I have to think about it some more" to "get back to me later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, Charlie's last before returning to the (slightly different than the regular school year) routines of ESY, was a transition day. Meaning that, our household was on edge. Meaning that, everyone (Charlie too) wanted to keep things "peaceful easy-feeling" and while I can't say the whole day was 100% like that (I was called to do the "support vehicle" thing in the midst of Jim and Charlie's bike ride; ended up having a nice bagel lunch with the boys at our favorite place), the day ended very nicely with Charlie back in his bed and me scrambling to fill his lunchbox. (But only with snacks, as ESY is half a day.) The clincher to the peaceful easy-feelingness was a sudden burst of spontaneous activity. Charlie kept asking for a "diner," but---mindful of the two previous diner/anxiety combos, we noted we'd just done that and could go later in the week. We got a pizza which Charlie said no too and then Jim, out of the blue, wanted to go to Target to get a basketball. So off we went, pizza in the back of the black car......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it just so happened that there's a McDonalds at the entrance to one side of Target and Charlie said no and no and no and then yes.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no and no and no to shooting baskets and then soon as we pulled up to a park, he was out the door and running back and forth on the court while Jim took some shots and I finished the pizza......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all very spontaneous. And it was fun, and delicious (I can't vouch for the McDonalds, but this was an excellent Jersey pizza), and quite out of the (boring old) routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some "early morning fireworks" on Monday, Charlie's first day at ESY, and then Charlie was calmly waiting on the grass for the bus. Three pleasant days have followed, each with some interesting moments (my total euphemism for what some might rather call "challenging behaviors"), but nothing ultra-challenging, and lots of bike rides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCIENTISTS FROM&lt;/strong&gt; Israel’s Technion University have unveiled a tiny robot, made using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, purportedly able to crawl through a person’s veins in order to diagnose and potentially treat artery blockage and cancer.The little robot – with a diameter of just one millimeter – has neither engine nor onboard controls, instead being propelled forward by a magnetic field wielded on it from outside the patient’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not quite nano technology, but we’re getting there. There is also work being done to create ant-like robots “to work in urban water distribution systems, to look for any leaks that need plugging.”&lt;/p&gt;

Very pleasant do it was, too, and I met some very interesting people, including the two stars of the show (Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A session, after the comedy routine, was kicked off  by some noodle (cough) asking ‘Is string theory completely mental?’ and there followed a rather interesting discussion on scrunched up dimensions. Or universes. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I understood it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you can do the maths: you’ve got electricity and magnetism and light; then with string theory gravity simply falls out. Which is pretty amazing, really. I followed up — after making the disclaimer that I’m a squishy biologist and I like to do experiments — with asking about how you might actually go about testing it. And the answer is either (a) build a bigger &lt;span&gt;LHC&lt;/span&gt; or (b) we can’t even conceive how to begin. The problem is that the energies required to smash particles together hard enough to see strings (simplifying wildly) are not attainable, so until some bright cove figures out a different paradigm we’re a bit stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking with &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nphys/about/about_eds/index.html"&gt;Alison Wright&lt;/a&gt; (to whom I offer an unreserved apology for using the term “&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; proper”) it was funny to hear how physicists are sometimes jealous of the empirical nature of biology, whereas I’m often frustrated that there isn’t such a solid theoretical underpinning. Physics papers are different, too: there’s a lot of ‘Oh, we predict this particle has these properties, here’s the experiment showing it, KTHXBAI’ without any of the hand-waving and conjecturing that makes biological papers so bloody long and cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physics as a field could well be dying, I heard: this and the fact that all the money is in biology means that physicists will be looking to collaborate more and more with us squishies. Not that the resultant papers will be publishable, because reviewers tend not to understand the other discipline in each case. So there’s a problem there which might prove lucrative to anyone of the right mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after all that, and talking to Jeff Forshaw (who is a very nice bloke), Alison said to me, ’That’s &lt;a href="http://www.llew.co.uk/home/"&gt;Robert Llewellyn&lt;/a&gt;, that is; I should go and tell him I’m from Northampton too.’ I made a little rugby joke about the road to Leicester, and then decided what the hey, this is London after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert is also a very nice bloke, and he was holding a four week old baby when I shook his hand, so he’s also rather dextrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pawns, whose favourite two shows are &lt;em&gt;Top Gear&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Red Dwarf&lt;/em&gt;, are in a state of disbelief this morning. ‘No,’ I told Rachel, ‘I didn’t ask for his autograph because that’s rather crass at such events.’ But I do have a photograph, which despite my profile information, I’m not sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep banging the &lt;del&gt;rocks&lt;/del&gt; particles together, guys.

Should have seen this one coming. It was only a matter of time before the celebrity “psychics” exploiting the death of such a major celebrity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make up your own mind about James Van Praagh, noted cold reader psychic, who (&lt;a href="http://www.palluxo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=609:exclusive-interview-with-dead-michael-jackson-psychic-medium&amp;amp;catid=4:news&amp;amp;Itemid=104"&gt;according to the Palluxo news site&lt;/a&gt;) claims to have spoken with Michael Jackson the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where are you located now, Michael” asked Van Praagh. “I am surrounded by happiness. I never felt more happier,” said Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about his children, Jackson started crying. “I miss them a lot. I want them to be happy. I will be with them… in their hearts, will be looking over their shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I guess it was worth it to get some amazing insight that only the REAL ghost of Michael Jackson could have come up with. Sylvia Browne too claims to have contacted the ghost of the self-proclaimed “King of Pop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I asked him to identify himself by moving my desk. The desk started trembling, then it moved a feet or two away from me. He wrote his name on my desk,” she said. “This was Michael’s sign of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely, Browne presented no evidence of any of this except for her word. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuPadpaTwKY"&gt;And we all know what Sylvia Browne’s word is worth, don’t we&lt;/a&gt;? I also wrote about Von Praagh before&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/05/22/letter-to-the-editor-5-22-09/"&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As well as one story that’s only very loosely related because it’s exactly the kind of thing you’d expect to hear on Fox “News.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.st.ignatius.net/weepingjesus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.st.ignatius.net/weepingjesus.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="141"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. First, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/08/fox-news-declares-obama-anti-christian-for-air-forces-decision-to-keep-church-and-state-separate/"&gt;the Friendly Atheist reports about Fox’s latest attempt to paint President Obama as an anti-Christian out to ban religion&lt;/a&gt;. This came after Chris Rodda of the Daily Kos reported about an unconstitutional tradition of public-funded military planes doing flyovers at evangelical Christian events. After the &lt;a href="http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/"&gt;Military Religious Freedom Foundation&lt;/a&gt; exposed this scandal, the flyovers stopped, including those scheduled for the “God and Country Festival” in Idaho, an overtly Christian event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to Gretchen Carlson of &lt;em&gt;Fox and Friends&lt;/em&gt; bringing &lt;strong&gt;Patrick Mahoney&lt;/strong&gt; of the Christian Defense Coalition onto her show to condemn the change in policy and inexplicably blame Obama for this incident and use the event as a platform to call the president an anti-Christian bigot.  Carlson didn’t have anyone else on the show to debate the other side because. . .you know, Fox is “fair and balanced. And to give a hint of what an extraordinary idiot (or liar–I report, you decide) Mr. Mahoney is, at one point he says that the Constitution says Americans have the freedom of religion and NOT the freedom from religion. Apparently, he’s never actually read the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, see liberals! The Constitution says nothing about all about freedom from rel–OH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One wonders what Carlson’s reaction would be if she heard military planes were doing flyovers at a Muslim festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.indecisionforever.com/files/2008/08/victoria-jackson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blog.indecisionforever.com/files/2008/08/victoria-jackson.jpg" alt="" width="136" height="169"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Although this story isn’t actually about Fox “News,” it involves such enormous ignorance combined with pure vitriolic hatred for President Obama that you’d swear it was voiced by a Fox “News” pundit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’ve blogged before about Julia Sweeney, the intelligent and well-spoken former Saturday Night Live star who became an outspoken atheist and even made a one-woman show out of the story of her apostasy. Well, one of her former castmates, Victoria Jackson, kinda went another way since the show ended. She became a batshit insane Religious Right evangelical loon. &lt;a href="http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/vjackson/2009/07/07/ignorance-is-bliss/"&gt;And Victoria Jackson had this to say about our President in her latest unstructured and erratic blog rant&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama legally kills babies and now he can legally kill Grandmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitler did this.  He killed the weak, the sick, the old, and babies and races/religions he didn’t like.  Hitler also controlled the media.  (Where’s the public debate between scientists on “Climate Change/Global Warming?”)   Hitler had the VW bug invented as the state car. What will O’s nationalized car be? So… kill off the weak.  That’s the plan.  Tax the workers to death.  Erase the middle class.  Sounds like the evil governments we studied in high school long ago.  The evil governments were :  kings, oligarchies, facist, socialist, and communist.  Now it’s called the Obama Administration. Sounds like candy or a rock band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to get a closer look into the strange world that is Victoria Jackson’s mind, here’s how the blog began:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d been wondering why the liberals are so passionate about this &lt;strong&gt;Health Care&lt;/strong&gt; thing.  It couldn’t be because they actually care about sick, poor people.  If they did, they would visit hospitals, and give ten percent of their gross salaries to Compassion International and World Vision, like us stupid church go-ers do. Biden gave $ 62 to charity last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, there’s gotta be a catch.  I guess this question was sitting in my brain and during my sleep, my brain was working on it, because when I suddenly awoke at 3 a.m.  I had the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Euthanasia!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Security and Medicare are broke.  Baby boomers, like me, are getting old and will soon be asking for it.  &lt;strong&gt;Socialized medicine makes people die.&lt;/strong&gt; You stand in a long, long line with a breast lump, clogged artery, or sharp pencil stuck in your eye, and someone like the DMV person, who can’t speak English, has chewing gum, an attitiude, really long fake nails that curl up at the end,  and is talking on a cell phone, enjoying their power trip moment, is finally face to face with you.  They mumble something incoherent about paperwork. You die. One less person in line for Social Security and Medicare!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;Socialized medicine makes people die.” &lt;/strong&gt;And no, that’s not my emphasis. SHE put that statement in &lt;strong&gt;BOLD&lt;/strong&gt;. WOW! Yeah, what’s with all those liberals who are actually concerned about that little “Health Care thing” anyway? Who needs if it makes Victoria Jackson have to wait a little bit longer on a line that no other public health care countries actually have and if it resembles some stereotyped version of the DMV. And let’s not let little details like the fact that the DMV, the U.S. Postal Service, and other commonly cited examples actually work quite well despite some people finding them annoying to deal with–let’s not let all that get in the way of a perfectly good non-sensical criticism. I think the host of The Young Turks said it best: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9S5EGNeM1M"&gt;Victoria Jackson is really this dumb&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:BSZY0wsZrmD5jM:http://souljonz.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/blackface_nocap.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn%3ABSZY0wsZrmD5jM%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fsouljonz.files.wordpress.com%2F2007%2F08%2Fblackface_nocap.jpg&amp;amp;w=91&amp;amp;h=125" alt="" width="91" height="125"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;3. And did I detect the slightest hint of racism or xenophobia in that depiction of DMV employees? Nah! But speaking of racism, that brings me to &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5310208/brian-kilmeade-would-like-species-and-ethnics-to-remain-pure"&gt;Brian Kilmeade also of &lt;em&gt;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/em&gt;, who had this to say&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/fox-their-friends-the-reason-the-facebalm-was-invented/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/b6Y9sTC7yN8/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! What did he just say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIAN KILMEADE: We keep marrying other species and other ethnics–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRETCHEN CARLSON: Are you sure they are not suffering from some of the causes of dementia right now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BRIAN KILMEADE: The problem is the Swedes have pure genes. They marry other Swedes, that’s the rule. Finns marry other Finns; they have a pure society. In America we marry everybody. We will marry Italians and Irish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh. Interesting. Thanks for the insightful biology lesson there, Brian.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, there was a link to a book review on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0195313682/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;n=283155&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for the title, &lt;i&gt;Snake Oil Science: The Truth about Complementary and Alternative Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, by R. Barker Bausell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One member of the forum had the following all-too-common-to-skeptics comment:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since we know only a fraction of a percent of how physics, chemistry and physiology work it seems pretty arrogant for someone to criticize effective therapies because the model the practitioner was taught is faulty. Every scientific model ever from Newton to Einstein has been proven wrong or adapted, that's how the process works. The implication that some branch of science or medicine is somehow 100% correct or informed is absurd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explain the placebo effect to me and we'll talk skeptic. Your life may be full of "facts" but it lacks the color and mystery mine has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers, good luck.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Firstly, I have to address what is known as an "argument from ignorance".  This is a logical fallacy where someone says that because something is unknown or difficult to know, that it is impossible to know.  In the above, the commenter's fallacy says, in essence, &lt;i&gt;"we know only a fraction of a percent of how physics, chemistry and physiology work"&lt;/i&gt;, therefore alt.med. is true.  We (the royal "we", not including myself) know much more than "a fraction of a percent" of physics, chemistry and physiology and because of this, we can say with very near certainty that homeopathy, acupuncture, and other alt.med. modalities are ineffective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The commenter also assumes efficacy with respect to alt.med. "therapies".  All we say, as skeptics, is to show evidence under proper controlled circumstances.  This is usually never met with compliance.  A major difference (and many times an unspoken sticking point) between skeptics and believers, is their level of acceptance for "evidence".  What a believer will take as rock-solid proof that their pet "therapy" is efficacious will make a skeptic shake his or her head in disbelief and annoyance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The commenter then makes this (summarized) argument: science has been wrong in the past (lists prominent names like Newton/Einstein), so no one knows for sure what's going on, therefore trust alt.med.  This is known as the &lt;i&gt;"two-wrongs make a right"&lt;/i&gt; fallacy and what it is saying is that because alt.med. does not know how the world works, neither does science, therefore everything is equal and why not trust an alt.med. practitioner?  Science will change in the future and the alt.med. will be validated - jump on the bandwagon early!  Nevermind that "no evidence" thing....&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Then we have a strawman; a caricature of the adversarial position that is easy to dismantle and/or ridicule.  No scientist or branch of science claims to be, &lt;i&gt;"100% correct or informed"&lt;/i&gt;, so to claim this is silly and, honestly, it is a mirror of the alt.med. position.  Where science-based medicine is forced to be honest in difficult situations and admit that there is nothing that can be safely done to help, alt.med. is always lurking with a made-up answer.  It is alt.med. that claims to be 100% informed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The commenter then asks: &lt;i&gt;"Explain the placebo effect to me and we'll talk skeptic"&lt;/i&gt; - If the commenter read the link, perhaps this bit would have stood out as it deals with that particular question:&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, as Bausell reveals, it is the placebo effect that accounts for most of the positive results. He explores this remarkable phenomenon--the biological and chemical evidence for the placebo effect, how it works in the body, and why research on any therapy that does not factor in the placebo effect will inevitably produce false results.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Finally, the commenter drops the, "science unweaves the rainbow" argument.  Skeptics are dull, boring, lack "mystery and color".  We do not get New Age therapies and are jealous of the chakra-feeling, aura-seeing, light-ball-making healers that are everywhere, &lt;b&gt;everywhere&lt;/b&gt;, man!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists &lt;b&gt;love&lt;/b&gt; mystery.  They love it more than the alt.med folks do and I can prove it: Show me any alt.med practice that has been left behind because new evidence arose that showed it to be ineffective.  Science (any branch) looks to new areas, places where mystery and confusion lie, and tries to learn whatever it can glean.  Alt.med just makes up answers based on dogma and never changes.  Exploring new areas of interest is sexy and it attracts the best and brightest of every era - Columbus, the astronauts and cosmonauts of the space race and beyond, the thinkers who make predictions that are discovered true years after the death of the maker.  Alt.med and its practitioners just look pale in comparison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saying that science takes away mystery and "color" is just plain wrong.  It always reminds me of this beautiful passage from Richard Feynman:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have a friend who’s an artist and he’s some times taken a view which I don’t agree with very well. He’ll hold up a flower and say, "look how beautiful it is," and I’ll agree, I think. And he says, "you see, I as an artist can see how beautiful this is, but you as a scientist, oh, take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing." And I think he’s kind of nutty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me, too, I believe, although I might not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is. But I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, I see much more about the flower that he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside which also have a beauty. I mean, it’s not just beauty at this dimension of one centimeter: there is also beauty at a smaller dimension, the inner structure...also the processes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that the colors in the flower are evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting – it means that insects can see the color. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It adds a question – does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms that are...why is it aesthetic, all kinds of interesting questions which a science knowledge only adds to the excitement and mystery and the awe of a flower. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It only adds. I don’t understand how it subtracts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Exactly.&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

Believe it or not, I'll even be on a panel! While I'm gone,  I'll probably manage to do a new post or two, but, in the meantime, while I'm away communing with fellow skeptics at &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;TAM7&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be reposting some Classic Insolence from the month of July in years past. (After all, if you haven't been following this blog at least a year, it'll be new to you. And if you have I hope you enjoy it again.) This particular post first appeared in July 2008.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Last week, The New York Times started a rather unusual series in its medical section entitled, &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/series/the_evidence_gap/index.html"&gt;The Evidence Gap&lt;/a&gt;, described thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Articles in this series will explore medical treatments used despite scant proof they work and will consider steps toward medicine based on evidence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw the series, I was prepared for a crapfest. My experience has generally been that when reporters start examining the evidence for and against a treatment they usually do a pretty lousy job. This is most obvious when it comes to "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM), where we are routinely treated to utterly credulous articles touting the latest poorly designed study demonstrating that this or that fairy dust cures cancer and the common cold (I exaggerate, but not by much) or "exposes" on the latest misdeeds by big pharma, in which risks are either exaggerated or not put into perspective. Oddly enough (or not so oddly enough) seldom does the misinformation go in the other direction, with excessive credulity towards pharma-produced evidence and excessive skepticism for evidence relating to the efficacy and safety of CAM modalities, but that's a topic for another day. I don't so much mind the tighter skepticism regarding the claims of big pharma, given its history; I only wish that similar skepticism applied to the claims of big CAM. In any case, the point is that generally medical reporting tends to be very poor at doing a fair, objective analysis of the state of the actual evidence regarding a treatment modality, so much so that I sit up and take notice when I find an exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how the the rest of the articles in the series play out, this &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/series/the_evidence_gap/index.html"&gt;New York Times series&lt;/a&gt; may very well be one of those exceptions. As a maven of science- and evidence-based medicine, I approve--thus far, anyway. The first two entries are on cardiovascular testing and cancer chemotherapy. I'll spend the most time on the latter, but I can't resist a brief treatment of the former before I get to the latter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_costs_and_benefits_of_the_latest_gre.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/the_costs_and_benefits_of_the_latest_gre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/JWIoPx-ZH-0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247115208106"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/ill_have_my_volts_in_20_increm.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd88f328781c0f53</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Classic Isis"/><title type="html">I'll Have My Volts in $20 Increments</title><published>2009-07-09T03:33:25Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T03:33:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~3/PTPO-l9-Zv4/ill_have_my_volts_in_20_increm.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/ill_have_my_volts_in_20_increm.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a post I wrote years ago on a personal blog I kept.  Apparently this commercial sparked quite the discussion between Mr. Isis and I...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night Mr. Isis and I were sitting in bed watching TV together and we saw &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcgy-Pht9Ls"&gt;this 
commercial&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Isis told me that is that ever happened to him, he would poop himself.  
Literally poop himself.  I thought it would be funny if that happened on 
occasion.  He thought the only way it would ever be acceptable for a giant 
plastic king to sneak up behind you at the ATM was if the ATMs had little Tasers 
attached to them.  You know, like the pen on a chain?  Well, the ATMs could have 
Tasers on chains in case the giant plastic king showed up....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I realized (and told my husband) that a Taser on a chain for public use 
seemed like a poor idea.  People would Taser each other just for giggles.  Heck, 
&lt;em&gt;I would &lt;/em&gt; Taser people for giggles.  I would ask people to come to the 
ATM with me so that I could get cash and Taser them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Isis&amp;#39;s solution was that any time you used the Taser it would debit your 
account some amount of money as a service charge.  I asked him how much and he 
suggested maybe $1.  I told him there was no way that would deter me from 
Tasering my people for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$10? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$100?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1000?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might keep me from Tasering more than one person.  In order to keep me 
from Tasering people, with the exception of the most life-and-death situation, I 
would need to be charged a fee that would potentially prevent my son from going 
to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just have that little self control  And because of that, you bitches aren&amp;#39;t 
getting a Taser at your ATM to protect you from the giant plastic king.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/07/ill_have_my_volts_in_20_increm.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/isis/~4/PTPO-l9-Zv4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/index.xml</id><title type="html">On Becoming a Domestic and Laboratory Goddess</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247112495095"><id gr:original-id="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/?p=5469">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cba6597cf2d62d47</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Animals"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Environment"/><category term="Family"/><category term="atmosphere"/><category term="autism"/><title type="html">Bully in the house</title><published>2009-07-09T04:07:26Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T04:07:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/bully-in-the-house/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blisstree.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s a bully living in our house, and its name is autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/fist.jpg" alt="Photo courtesy of littledan77 (flickr.com)" width="500" height="202"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy of littledan77 (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism’s the reason the TV is so often on. Toys scattered all over the floor? Autism likes it that way. Freezer well-stocked (OK, stuffed) with packages of Hebrew National franks bought on sale? Autism loves those. Doesn’t like to try new foods. A lot of hardcover books get separated from their dust jackets. Why? Only autism can tell you the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day (or almost every day) if I’m in the apartment alone, I do the following: pick up the toys. Sweep up the crumbs. (Autism loves pretzels.) Sort the toys back into whatever categories — giant letters, jungle animals, toy cars — they belong to. Think to myself, when the living room is tidy again, Why can’t it always look like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bully isn’t always here, luckily. Sometimes he leaves and a different guy steps in, one who loves to read, work on a jigsaw puzzle with me and his brother, or even take a few turns in the kitchen helping make cookie dough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m starting to see we have to fight to maintain some order in the house — pare down the toys, and find a way to make the bully realize he lives here with three other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Obama legally kills babies and now he can legally kill Grandmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitler did this.  He killed the weak, the sick, the old, and babies and races/religions he didn’t like.  Hitler also controlled the media.  (Where’s the public debate between scientists on “Climate Change/Global Warming?”)   Hitler had the VW bug invented as the state car. What will O’s nationalized car be? So… kill off the weak.  That’s the plan.  Tax the workers to death.  Erase the middle class.  Sounds like the evil governments we studied in high school long ago.  The evil governments were :  kings, oligarchies, facist, socialist, and communist.  Now it’s called the Obama Administration. Sounds like candy or a rock band.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, there are very few physiological processes that can serve as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/02/introduction_to_anatomy_and_ph.php" title=""&gt;examples of positive feedback&lt;/a&gt;.  These include opening of the ion channels during the action potential, the blood clotting cascade, emptying of the urinary bladder, copulation, breastfeeding and childbirth.  The last two (and perhaps the &lt;a href="http://anteriorcommissure.blogspot.com/2007/09/oxytocin-vasopressin-and-no-strings.html" title=""&gt;last three&lt;/a&gt;!) involve the hormone oxytocin.  The childbirth, at least in humans, is a canonical example and the standard story goes roughly like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/02/introduction_to_anatomy_and_ph.php" title=""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the baby is ready to go out (and there's no stopping it at this point!), it releases a hormone that triggers the first contraction of the uterus. The contraction of the uterus pushes the baby out a little. That movement of the baby stretches the wall of the uterus. The wall of the uterus contains stretch receptors which send signals to the brain. In response to the signal, the brain (actually the posterior portion of the pituitary gland, which is an outgrowth of the brain) releases hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin gets into the bloodstream and reaches the uterus triggering the next contraction which, in turn, moves the baby which further stretches the wall of the uterus, which results in more release of oxytocin...and so on, until the baby is expelled, when everything returns to normal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, introductory textbook material lags by a few years (or decades) behind the current state of scientific understanding.  And a brand new paper just added a new monkeywrench into the story. &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000922" title=""&gt;Oxytocin in the Circadian Timing of Birth&lt;/a&gt; by Jeffrey Roizen, Christina E. Luedke, Erik D. Herzog and Louis J. Muglia was published last Tuesday night and I have been poring over it since then.  It is a very short paper, yet there is so much there to think about!  Oh, and of course I was going to comment on a paper by Erik Herzog - you knew that was coming!  Not just that he is my friend, but he also tends to ask all the questions I consider interesting in my field, including questions I wanted to answer myself while I was still in the lab (so I live vicariously though his papers and blog about every one of them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have not found time yet to write a Clock Tutorial on the fascinating topic of embryonic development of the circadian system in mammals and the transfer of circadian time from mother to fetus - a link to it would have worked wonderfully here - so I'll have to make shortcuts, but I hope that the gist of the paper will be clear anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/oxytocin_and_childbirth_or_not_2.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/oxytocin_and_childbirth_or_not_2.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/JhQ3Uy5Sra8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247106063668"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/newspapers_editor_exposes_inte.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e12ed274b0dc495</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current events"/><title type="html">Newspaper's editor exposes intern's plagiarism.</title><published>2009-07-09T02:20:02Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T02:20:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/bMOwkBVj88M/newspapers_editor_exposes_inte.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/newspapers_editor_exposes_inte.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Springs &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gazette.com/articles/gazette-58112-stories-four.html"&gt;discovered that a summer intern in their newsroom published articles with plagiarized passages&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The end result is a high resolution 87.4 megapixel image of the Moon, larger even then previous images taken by some of the world's largest observatories, allowing features as small as 1km to be clearly seen.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is the world's record for the largest mosaic of the Moon ever made, and it's available for you to view in full detail (!) at their site, &lt;a href="http://www.lunarworldrecord.com/image.php"&gt;Lunar World Record 2009&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The military was regularly providing flyovers at countless evangelical Christian events all over the country, not only violating the regulations prohibiting military participation in religious events, but spending millions of dollars of taxpayer money in the process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.militaryreligiousfreedom.org/"&gt;Military Religious Freedom Foundation&lt;/a&gt; exposed what was happening and the participation in Christian events declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, MRFF got ahold of a response letter from the military to a request for further Air Force participation in a Christian ceremony:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your Air Force aviation support request doesn’t fall into either approved category, as such, we are unable to approve it. Air Force and DoD policy prohibit support for events which appear to endorse, selectively benefit, or favor any special interest group, religious or ideological movement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Air Force said it would not participate in the “God and Country Festival” in Idaho last week.  It’s a &lt;a href="http://www.idahopress.com/news/?2009-07-03-Pentagon-nixes-flyover"&gt;specifically Christian event&lt;/a&gt; and that violated the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Organizers don’t deny the explicitly Christian nature of the annual patriotic rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, it’s about as Christian as you can get — we believe in promoting Christianity,” [Director Patti] Syme said. “And we have no plans to change that.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to military personnel for fixing a 42-year-long error.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, cut to this morning… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Carlson&lt;/strong&gt; of Fox and Friends &lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/fox-report-suggests-pentagon-policy"&gt;heard about what transpired&lt;/a&gt;.  She invited &lt;strong&gt;Patrick Mahoney&lt;/strong&gt; of the Christian Defense Coalition to discuss the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partial transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Carlson&lt;/strong&gt;: So when I first read this story, I actually found it hard to believe. Because for 42 years, at this rally in Idaho, the Pentagon has authorized a flyover. Suddenly this year, a new president in office, and a new policy. What do you make of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahoney&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, we’re stunned, actually, and it’s a reminder that our Constitution promises freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.  I think the viewers need to understand, the flyovers that were held for 42 years were not to endorse or promote any religion, but to honor the military, who was there in force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahoney&lt;/strong&gt;: I think it causes one to pause and say, ‘What changed? After 42 years, what changed?’ And Gretchen, the only indicator we have is that we have a new commander in chief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that we are wondering, when we look at President Obama: Is there a culture of hostility toward expressions of faith in the public square — particularly Christian?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pain you feel is the aching in your brain.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Obama&lt;/strong&gt; has nothing to do with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the God and Country Festival is explicitly favoring one religion: Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know if military planes were flying over a mosque because of an Islamic celebration, Mahoney and Carlson would be saying something entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;

Look at this &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5310208/brian-kilmeade-would-like-species-and-ethnics-to-remain-pure"&gt;clip where Brian Kilmeade is, for some unknown reason, trying to dismiss a study&lt;/a&gt; that found that married people were at a lower risk for Alzheimer's disease. I have no knowledge of the study, but his reasons for dismissing its applicability to Americans are bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIAN KILMEADE: We keep marrying other species and other ethnics--
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Are you sure they are not suffering from some of the causes of dementia right now?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
BRIAN KILMEADE: The problem is the Swedes have pure genes. They marry other Swedes, that's the rule. Finns marry other Finns; they have a pure society. In America we marry everybody. We will marry Italians and Irish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WTF? Italians and Irish are not part of "we"? They're a different &lt;i&gt;species&lt;/i&gt;? Intermarriage between ethnicities is a problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something like 19th century racism. By the way, Kilmeade is a vocal conservative Christian.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/clearly_no_one_watches_fox_new.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/CE1HgAzRfh0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247101301851"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/collins_to_head_nih.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0480020c79031d3d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Collins to head NIH</title><published>2009-07-09T00:13:06Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T00:13:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/amYjZsDB8ls/collins_to_head_nih.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/collins_to_head_nih.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh, great. &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=atJa8QDGj8QU"&gt;He's been appointed by Obama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Bob O'Hara of the &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/boboh" title=""&gt;Deep Thoughts and Silliness&lt;/a&gt; blog to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Bob O'Hara, but I comment on blogs and such places under the absolutely impenetrable pseudonym of Bob O'H.  I have a blog on Nature Network, called &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/blogs/user/boboh" title=""&gt;Deep Thoughts and Silliness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a full time academic, which means I get to be both a nerd and as obscure as I can manage.  I used to be a plant epidemiologist, but I now work in biostatistics, mainly in ecology and evolutionary biology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="BobO&amp;#39;Hara pic.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/BobO%27Hara%20pic.jpg" width="358" height="269" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butler to The Beast (pictured).  It's only a part-time position, and he pays me in cat hair, which the bank doesn't accept.  I think it must be because they don't like Australian currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I'm not acting as a resting place, I'm an Academy Fellow.  The academy in question is the Academy of Finland: the position is basically that of a lecturer, only without the lecturing. I live in Helsinki, dodging the polar bears and itinerant OS developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the pissing around, rather than taking the science too seriously.  But I am now becoming more interested in using online tools for collaboration, for example wikis.  A lot of my work is collaborative, so I'm looking for tools to make it easier.  Emailing Word documents is hardy optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used blogging to kick a few ideas around, getting &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2008.03.003" title=""&gt;one piece published&lt;/a&gt;, and stirring up interest with some others.  I'm using wikis to help collaboration, but I think they don't integrate well enough into usual work practices yet.  I guess we'll have to wait for Google Wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other social networks don't really figure in my work, except as excellent vehicles for prevarication.  Few of my colleagues use them, so they don't figure in my work.  Hopefully that will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't remember!  I had looked at &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/" title=""&gt;Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt; a few times, but really started following it during the hilarities of the Dover trial.  That dragged me into other science blogs (I know it's not original, but &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" title=""&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first blogs I read - at least it was before ScienceBlogs started up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are too many good blogs to plug!  But a couple of blogs that I think should be better known are &lt;a href="http://paleocoll.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Prerogative of Harlots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://masksoferis.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Masks of Eris&lt;/a&gt;.  Masks of Eris, in particular, should be required reading, especially if you want to understand Finland and the Finnish mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I also have to plug &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/" title=""&gt;Grllllllsciennntissssst&lt;/a&gt;, and her efforts to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2009/07/antarctica_others_think_id_do.php" title=""&gt;win a trip to Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't discovered any new bloggers, but meeting &lt;a href="http://propterdoc.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Propter Doc&lt;/a&gt; reminded me to check out her blog more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why did you come to the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was mainly to meet people who I knew virtually in the flesh.  I had met some poeple in London, but obviously not many Americans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to meet &lt;a href="http://udoj.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;JanieBelle&lt;/a&gt;, but she didn't attend, and sent her grouchy uncle &lt;a href="http://crowdedheadcozybed.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Lou&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the main thing was the discussion of Open Access.  It's something I find interesting from the sociological point of view: the technology has opened up the possibilities for OA, but acceptance of it needs some changes in the way we pay for publication.  On top of simply the finances, web based publishing makes it possible to try out some very interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was clear to me was that there is a large gap between the idealism of some OA advocates, and the world that most scientists inhabit.  So, the idea that journals shouldn't have to judge importance when deciding whether to publish a piece of research seems naïve: there is certainly a place for that sort of journal (as readers of this blog are well aware!), but I think the importance of publishing in a "good" journal can't be ignored: whether we like it or not, scientists use this as a marker for the quality of their work, for gloating to their colleagues, or for judging other researchers' output.  This is part of the sociology of science: it's how we behave as scientists.  My impression is that this simply isn't appreciated by some OA advocates, and it can make their message sound irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an experienced denizen of the blogosphere, I know that I don't have to provide any answers - I can criticise as much as I want!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It was so nice to finally meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you. I had a lot of fun in NC, so hopefully I'll be able to visit again next year. &lt;/p&gt;

The conclusion: more hate crimes happen than are reported, hate crimes are less often recognized for what they really are, and people who have committed hate crimes are getting lighter sentences than they deserve.  Sound like some common themes from &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_hate_crimes_safer_school_buses"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/megaconference_special_1_of_6_violence_and_abuse"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/fight_club_atrocity_update"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/self-advocacy_and_support_worker_atrocities"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the story it sounds like Wales (and if anyone more local to Wales is reading this please correct me if I'm wrong) has a much better anti-hate crimes policy than the U.S. (hopefully we'll have &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/hate_crimes_are_hate_crimes_are_hate_crimes"&gt;better&lt;/a&gt; soon).  And yet, this has done little good when violence or abuse are not being reported as hate crimes, even when they are being reported at all.  Hate crimes as in the abuse was done specifically because the person has a disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reasons for this cited in the article are the difficulty in recognizing that abuse was done because the person is disabled, lack of the victim being able to report the abuse as a hate crime, and lack of hate crimes education on the part of law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it would be best if the reasons for hate crimes would go away and there would be a greater acceptance of diversity in the world.  However, until then, in addition to solid anti-hate crimes legislation, we need solid education for both potential victims and law enforcement of what hate crimes against people with disabilities look like.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247096988063"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c9254713349d0812</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><title type="html">The Last 100 Years: 1987, a Supernova, and the luckiest physicist ever</title><published>2009-07-09T03:19:27Z</published><updated>2009-07-09T03:19:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe.php" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="html">&lt;p&gt;By the 1980s, our view of the Universe was pretty close to what it is today.  We had confirmed the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/06/the_last_100_years_1948_gamow.php"&gt;Big Bang Theory&lt;/a&gt; and even had some understanding of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1979_and_be.php"&gt;what must've caused the Big Bang&lt;/a&gt;.  There were some mysteries around, such as dark matter, the age of the Universe, and the solar neutrino problem, but all in all, we were on pretty solid ground.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things astronomers had been waiting for was a supernova to go off in our galaxy.  We expect about one per century in our galaxy, and we hadn't seen one &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1604"&gt;since 1604&lt;/a&gt;!  It's 2009 now, and we still haven't seen one, but in 1987, we got closer than any other time since 1604.  Take a look at our nearby galactic neighborhood:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/Satellite_Galaxies.JPG" width="512" alt="Satellite_Galaxies.JPG"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our Milky Way is certainly the most dominant thing until we get out to Andromeda, more than 2 million light years away, many of these dwarfs and clouds actually have a lot going on.  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), for example, has over &lt;b&gt;10 billion stars&lt;/b&gt; in it!  And in 1987, something fascinating happened over there in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_Nebula"&gt;Tarantula Nebula&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/800px-Spitzer-TarantulaNebula.jpg" width="500" alt="800px-Spitzer-TarantulaNebula.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the outskirts of this nebula, one of the more massive stars in this cloud simply ran out of fuel, collapsed, and created &lt;a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/1999/04/sn1987anino.html"&gt;a giant supernova explosion&lt;/a&gt;.  Can you spot the supernova in this Hubble Space Telescope picture?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/9904b.jpg" width="500" alt="9904b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look in the middle.  There's one small part that's brighter than the rest.  I can't zoom in on the image above, but the Hubble Space Telescope, thankfully, did.  Let's take a look at what it sees:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/hs-2007-10-a-web_print.jpg" width="500" alt="hs-2007-10-a-web_print.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/hs-2007-10-a-web_print.jpg"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for the full size shot.)  Now, this was interesting to people who studied stars, supernovae, nuclear physics, and many others for all sorts of reasons.  But sometimes, the greatest discovery is the one you weren't planning on.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me explain, and let me do it by taking you over to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamioka_Observatory"&gt;Kamioka&lt;/a&gt;, Japan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/PB200148.jpg" width="512" alt="PB200148.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's this?  It's a huge, underground tank being constructed!  There was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi%E2%80%93Glashow_model"&gt;a popular theory&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1980s that, as one of its consequences, predicted that the &lt;i&gt;proton&lt;/i&gt; would decay!  In order to look for this, the Japanese, led by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masatoshi_Koshiba"&gt;Masatoshi Koshiba&lt;/a&gt;, build a huge tank of water with detectors all around the edge to look for decaying protons.  The experiment was called Kamiokande, for the Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment.  In fact, here's a modern-day picture of the current detector at Kamioka:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/Super_Kamiokande_boat.jpg" width="512" alt="Super_Kamiokande_boat.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1987, it had 3000 metric tons of water inside of it, or about 10^34 protons.  Well, this detector was going for awhile, and it didn't see any decaying protons.  You watch 10^34 protons for a year, none of them decay, and what do you conclude?  That protons live for at least 10^34 years!  (This is incredibly long, considering that the Universe is only about 10^10 years old!)  But in 1987, the supernova above went off in the LMC.  It was the first time that any event this destructive and energetic occurred so close to us since the dawn of modern technology.  Kamiokande happened to be running, and you know what happened?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/Super_Kamiokande_Neutrino_Event.png" width="500" alt="Super_Kamiokande_Neutrino_Event.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detector went off!  Not just with one event like this, but &lt;b&gt;with 11 events&lt;/b&gt;, all coming from the direction of this supernova!  You see, this &lt;i&gt;Nucleon Decay Experiment&lt;/i&gt; also functioned as a &lt;i&gt;Neutrino Detector Experiment&lt;/i&gt;.  Koshiba and his team had just detected the first astrophysical neutrinos from anything other than the Sun.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/Koshiba01.jpg" width="350" height="233" alt="Koshiba01.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this discovery and the work that grew out of it, Koshiba won the Nobel Prize in 2002.  This work led directly to the discovery of neutrino oscillations and the fact that neutrinos have a mass, which is pretty profound for particle physics.  But Koshiba has a claim to infamy as well as a claim to fame.  Just one year prior to winning the Nobel Prize, Koshiba caused &lt;a href="http://ale.physics.sunysb.edu/superk/"&gt;the greatest science disaster in Japanese history&lt;/a&gt;, where thousands of these detectors around the edge exploded in a chain reaction.  This was about &lt;a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/3446"&gt;a 30 million dollar mistake&lt;/a&gt;, and Koshiba was the one blamed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/upload/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe/koshiba-award.jpg" width="350" height="480" alt="koshiba-award.jpg"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you see, you can make a groundbreaking discovery, change our view of the laws of nature forever, win a Nobel Prize, and still do one of the dumbest things in history.  Sometimes, it's better to be lucky than good, and in Koshiba's case, he was in the right place with the right equipment at the right time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2009/07/the_last_100_years_1987_a_supe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/index.xml</id><title type="html">Starts With A Bang</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247095431577"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/i_chat_with_paw-talk_about_eth.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8cdfffff0de41623</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogospheric science"/><title type="html">I chat with Paw-talk about ethics and animal research.</title><published>2009-07-08T23:08:43Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T23:08:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/9CPoOuonPqI/i_chat_with_paw-talk_about_eth.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/07/i_chat_with_paw-talk_about_eth.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you're interested, &lt;a href="http://www.paw-talk.net/home.html"&gt;Paw-talk&lt;/a&gt;, a website aimed at humans with pets, invited me over to chat about philosophy, ethics, science, and the use of animals in research.

&lt;p&gt;And perhaps you also remember how the pastor at Manifested Glory Ministries Church, &lt;strong&gt;Patricia McKinney&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/06/25/the-homosexual-spirit/"&gt;didn’t talk very coherently&lt;/a&gt; during her interview with CNN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syndicated columnist &lt;strong&gt;Leonard Pitts, Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; has a question for McKinney and members of her church: &lt;a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/living/columnists/leonard-pitts/story/1117628.html"&gt;What does a Homosexual Demon look like&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I know you’re up against it right now, but I want to assure you: I’m not here to beat up on you, or to accuse you of being the bigots you say you aren’t, or to call you a bunch of backwards mouth breathers who abused a confused teenaged boy. No, I’m just hoping you’ll tell me what a homosexual demon looks like. I’m scared I may unknowingly run into one, so please help me sharpen my demon gaydar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, if you could run down all the various types of demons and ways to ferret them out, I’d be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to leave the impression I’m entirely demon illiterate. I do know a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance: the demons of fear, stupidity and intolerance. You don’t need to tell me what they look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have a good idea.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the point is that they’re making it all up.  No such demon exists and the church members are delusional when they think they’re doing something productive in beating the young man.&lt;/p&gt;

The Europeans have been pushing for 2 degrees as a target maximum temperature for several years, but this is something of a development for the Americans.  We &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/04/hit-the-brakes-hard/"&gt;posted recently&lt;/a&gt;   on two new papers about what it would take to limit global average warming, finding that it would require fairly strong change in trajectory.  About 2° C as a target, we  wrote, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… even a “moderate” warming of 2°C stands a strong chance of provoking drought and storm responses that could challenge civilized society, leading potentially to the conflict and suffering that go with failed states and mass migrations. Global warming of 2°C would leave the Earth warmer than it has been in millions of years, a disruption of climate conditions that have been stable for longer than the history of human agriculture. Given the drought that already afflicts Australia, the crumbling of the sea ice in the Arctic, and the increasing storm damage after only 0.8°C of warming so far, a target of 2°C seems almost cavalier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, not any more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like many software products, Google's Gmail service was first released with a "beta" label on it. In the software industry, a product that is in beta is still in its testing phase. Beta versions, which are sandwiched between internal "alpha" versions and final "release" versions, typically have a lifespan of weeks or perhaps months. But Gmail was different. Released on April 1, 2004, it was still in beta five years and tens of millions of users later.

&lt;p&gt;That is changing Tuesday. Gmail is finally shedding the beta label, signaling that Google considers the product to be fully baked. Google is also taking three other applications -- Calendar, Docs and Talk -- out of beta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Blogging has been very hard for me lately.  I love writing, but due to work and family mishegos it's been hard to keep up with the posting.  I'm hoping a stint up in the woods providing medical supervision to 400 souls will be rejuvenating.  While I'm gone, I'll leave you with some of my favorite posts about the human side of medicine.  I hope you enjoy reading them again, or for the first time.  --PalMD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I met this beautiful woman the other day.  She had a sad, glowing smile, was dressed impeccably, and had this wonderful accent.  I imagined her voice would be at home in some small corner of Europe where the pastries are always fresh, the coffee fragrant.  She was sitting in a chair next to man, or what used to be a man.  He lay stiffly in a bed like a bundle of fallen sticks---one of the sticks was being held gently by the beautiful woman, his wife.  The room was too big for them, the high ceiling and white walls almost deafeningly empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They belonged to another time, this couple.  The light poured through the window, stopped by a single IV pole  which left a long, thin shadow on the wall, like a tree in winter.  I pictured them in a different light, one a little richer, maybe browner, the colors subdued but present, not washed out like this day.  They must have held hands then, too, but less delicately, with less fear.  The young doctors stood by, also dwarfed by the room, but somehow less out of place.  It's not just that they were doctors, and this a hospital---they were more a part of this life, this place, this time.  They were near the beginning and middle of their journeys, not the end.  It was palpable.  They thought, "where might I be tomorrow? In bed yet?  Answering a call?  Drinking?" The questions hanging over the couple in the room were, "&lt;i&gt;Will&lt;/i&gt; I be tomorrow?  Are there any left?  Why?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's strange---to be in the middle point of my own journey, surrounded by people nearly at the end, or perhaps past the end.  Some live for the moment, never thinking it will end.  Some mourn for the sepia-past that never was.  But mostly I think they just cling to each other and to the moments, waiting, unsure, and watching as we middle-folk go about as if there will always be another day, another cup of coffee, another kiss.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/07/journeys.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/whitecoatunderground/~4/2PddRICfsjo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/index.xml</id><title type="html">White Coat Underground</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247092526255"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1444777680851092723">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c8dd9f18a82ba4eb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Francis Collins: Director of NIH</title><published>2009-07-08T21:42:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T21:46:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/francis-collins-director-of-nih.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1444777680851092723/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1444777680851092723" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Bad news from The White House.President Obama Announces Intent to Nominate Francis Collins as NIH DirectorWASHINGTON – Today, President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Francis S.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Note: the following quotations are from a news website called Palluxo, and so have not been verified. The misspellings in the quotations make me wonder about just how accurate this all is. Certainly, though, given the characters involved, it’s not a stretch at all to think these actions accurately described.]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not all people who claim to speak to the dead are evil con artists trying to milk any kind of celebrity they can from others in order to make a quick buck or a thousand, but some are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make up your own mind about James Van Praagh, noted cold reader psychic, who (&lt;a href="http://www.palluxo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=609:exclusive-interview-with-dead-michael-jackson-psychic-medium&amp;amp;catid=4:news&amp;amp;Itemid=104"&gt;according to the Palluxo news site&lt;/a&gt;) claims to have spoken with Michael Jackson the other day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where are you located now, Michael” asked Van Praagh. “I am surrounded by happiness. I never felt more happier,” said Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about his children, Jackson started crying. “I miss them a lot. I want them to be happy. I will be with them…  in their hearts, will be looking over their shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should make the tykes happy, knowing a ghost will be eternally spying on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as if this weren’t bad enough, the article ends with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;More answers from dead Michael Jackson will be revealed on upcoming Oprah Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone — or in this case, underdone — Sylvia Brown has jumped on this bandwagon, also &lt;a href="http://www.palluxo.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=619:after-death-michael-jackson-shows-signs-of-life&amp;amp;catid=90:blogs&amp;amp;Itemid=284"&gt;according to Palluxo&lt;/a&gt;. However, she couldn’t even muster the energy to have any quotations from Jackson. All she had was: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I asked him to identify himself by moving my desk. The desk started trembling, then it moved a feet or two away from me. He wrote his name on my desk,” she said. “This was Michael’s sign of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she claims her desk moved? I assume she has video of this, covering different angles, and key unbiased eye witnesses for backup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, all we have is her word for it? Oh, OK. Well then, let’s hope she’s more accurate here &lt;a href="http://www.stopsylvia.com/articles/montel_shawnhornbeck.shtml"&gt;than she was with Shawn Hornbeck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m done here. I need a shower now. Blecchhhhh.&lt;/p&gt;

A more recent article on Glasgow CHiro's website can be found &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/09/update-on-glasgow-chiropractic.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/06/say-goodbye-to-colic-easy-way.html"&gt;I blogged about&lt;/a&gt; Glasgow Chiropractic changing their website to remove references to colic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous posts on this site have demonstrated that evidence-free claims about the ability of chiropractors to cure/treat &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/05/chiropractic-for-menstrual-pains-no.html"&gt;period pains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/06/chiropractics-claim-wrist-action-but.html"&gt;carpal tunnel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/06/chiropractors-take-money-for-trying-to.html"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt; are routinely appearing on chiropractor's websites - in the blogposts above, I linked to Glasgow Chiropractic as an example.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A specific complaint about the contents of their website had been sent to the GCC and so, using &lt;a href="http://www.changedetection.com/"&gt;www.changedetection.com&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to see how Glasgow Chiropractic would react.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a pleasant surprise, the chiropractors seem they have come over all hand-wringy and repentant and have updated their website accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The change detection page for menstrual pain is &lt;a href="http://www.changedetection.com/log/glasgowchiropractic/menstrual-pain_log.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the one for shoulder pain and carpal tunnel syndrome is &lt;a href="http://www.changedetection.com/log/glasgowchiropractic/shoulder-pain_log.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the changes made by clicking on " View changes:   2009-07-08 13:57" about half way down on the left hand side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new page on shoulder pain is &lt;a href="http://www.glasgowchiropractic.com/pages/shoulder-pain.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and contains the bold title &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Chiropractic has never cured anyone of anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Wow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quite an admission, although one that is completely backed up by research data. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new addition to the website goes on to say:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If we go looking for the named condition that Chiropractic can be applied to and produce change in we will find ourselves in a merry-go-round of symptoms, loosing [sic] sight of the whole because of an obsession with the parts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the question of What can Chiropractic Cure should be changed to "How" can Chiropractic Assist? The answer is simple. A well functioning mind and body has a greater opportunity to heal, repair and function than a poorly functioning one. A well functioning mind and body depends to a significant degree on a well functioning spine and nerve system. This is Chiropractic's contribution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People find that chiropractic's ability to produce better spine and nerve system function changes their life expression. There are thousands of symptoms and conditions that chiropractic has been associated with helping, however don't ask "Can Chiropractic Cure this or that condition" - instead ask "If my mind and body was functioning better through Chiropractic would I be better placed to handle this condition?"&lt;/blockquote&gt; Have you got that? Don't ask "can chiropractic cure". Just don't. Ask a different question if you must, but don't ask if it can cure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.glasgowchiropractic.com/pages/menstrual-pain.html"&gt;page on menstrual pain&lt;/a&gt; contains an almost identical admission along with postmodern flakery but has some interesting text manipulations further down (new text in bold, previous text in brackets/italics)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Chiropractic management of dysmenorrhoea&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;helping&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;treating&lt;/span&gt;) women who suffer from dysmenorrhea, the majority of chiropractors address only problems located in the areas directly involved in causing the symptoms. In a study conducted to establish &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;which styles of Chiropractic care&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;treatments&lt;/span&gt;) are most frequently used by chiropractors for dysmenorrhea, manipulation was used in 100% of the cases.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Read that last sentence again in its old and new forms - the meaning has been changed to the point of silliness. Although perhaps they are now referring to a different study? Who knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A chiropractor’s role is to normalise the functions of the body by correcting spinal problems. The rationale behind the chiropractic &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;management&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;treatment&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;women suffering from&lt;/span&gt; dysmenorrhea is to &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;deal with&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;treat)&lt;/span&gt; its spinal and skeletal aspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chiropractic provides the mechanisms through which dysmenorrheic women can be relieved of their pain in a drug-free environment and even go on to live a life free of period pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;How&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; (What)&lt;/span&gt; can &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Chiropractic assist with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt; (a Chiropractor do for)&lt;/span&gt; menstrual pain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your chiropractor will perform a complete consult and examination and may take radiographs (x rays) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;if clinically required.&lt;/span&gt;). After review of the examination findings your chiropractor will recommend an appropriate and individual care program. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Chiropractic care&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Treatment&lt;/span&gt;) consists of specific manual adjustments, to the individual joints of the body and spine, which restore damaged neurologic function. As Grey’s Anatomy text states every single organ in the body is controlled by the nervous system. This includes the uterus and reproductive systems. Through the specific adjustment your chiropractor provides neurological &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;imput&lt;/span&gt;) that allows your nervous system, and so your organs, to adapt to environmental stresses. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;So by changing the word 'treat' to 'help' or similar, that makes it all ok. It's good to see that the X-rays are now only done 'if clinically required'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will that ever be the case if chiropractic has never cured anyone of anything?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-4933646657907127365?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247089921997"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/08/a-tapeworm-to-call-my-own/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e05d47eebe10ab8f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="The Parasite Files"/><title type="html">A Tapeworm To Call My Own</title><published>2009-07-08T21:32:07Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T21:32:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2009/07/08/a-tapeworm-to-call-my-own/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/acanthobothrium-zimmeri-crop.jpg" alt="acanthobothrium-zimmeri-crop.jpg" align="left"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are about 1.8 million species with names, out of an estimated &lt;a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/02-exec-summary.html#allspecies"&gt;8 to 9 million species&lt;/a&gt; in total.  In 2007 alone, scientists named &lt;a href="http://species.asu.edu/SOS"&gt;18516 new species&lt;/a&gt;. Naming a species is actually the final step in a long, slow journey. It starts with the discovery of an organism that looks like it just might not belong to any known species. Scientists then search the scientific literature to see if it is indeed new to science. If it is, they inspect it in painstaking detail, observing all the information one might be able to use to identify another organism as belonging to the same species. This is not the sort of work a gene-sequencing robot can do for you on your lunch break. This is natural history, old school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tapeworm was discovered in 1999. Janine Caira of the University of Connecticut and Kirsten Jensen of the University of Kansas were traveling aboard the &lt;em&gt;Ocean Harvest&lt;/em&gt;, a commercial trawling ship sailing the Arafura Sea &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arafura_Sea"&gt;off the north coast of Australia&lt;/a&gt;. The fisherman pulled up a massive whip-ray belonging to a species never seen before (shown below). Caira and Jensen were particularly interested in what lurked inside the fish: its tapeworms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/himantura220.jpg" alt="himantura220.jpg" align="right"&gt;There are some &lt;a href="http://129.237.138.55/PEETII/uconnPEETII.html"&gt;6000 species&lt;/a&gt; of tapeworms named so far. Some species live inside people. Others live inside beetles. Others live inside frogs. Not only do tapeworms live in a huge range of animal hosts, but the life cycle of a single species may take it through several different species–a shrimp, a fish, a sea bird, and back to the shrimp, for example. Scientists know a lot about a few species of tapeworms, but most of them live in familiar hosts like ourselves. But unfamiliar hosts have tapeworms too. Caira and her colleagues have traveled the world over to cut open sting rays, sharks, and other cartilaginous fishes to search for new species of tapeworms. And more often than not, they find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tapeworms they found that day in 1999, belonged to a genus called &lt;em&gt;Ancanthobothirum&lt;/em&gt;. They were small, measuring less than an inch long. Caira and Jensen dropped some of them into alcohol so that they could extract DNA later, and dropped the rest into formalin, which preserved the parasites so that they could be studied under a microscope without decaying. That task fell to &lt;a href="http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/eebedia/index.php/Carrie_Fyler"&gt;Carrie Fyler&lt;/a&gt;, who was writing her dissertation on &lt;em&gt;Acanthobothrium&lt;/em&gt;, which contains 165 known species. After studying the tapeworms Caira and Jensen brought back, Fyler determined that there were at least five new species among them, all gathered from a single fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year Fyler asked me to come to the annual meeting of the American Society of Parasitologists, where she had organized an &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/06/27/nice-and-weird-dispatches-from-the-depths-of-parasitology/"&gt;entertaining session&lt;/a&gt; on parasites in popular culture. There were talks on parasites in the movies, in art, and in poetry. Fyler asked me to give a talk based on my own experience writing blogs, articles, and an entire book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074320011X?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=074320011X"&gt;Parasite Rex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=carlzimmercom&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=074320011X" style="border:medium none!important;margin:0px!important" border="0" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, on these marvelous beasts. At the meeting, Fyler told the audience how the book had helped propel her into parasitology. What she didn’t tell them was that she was working on a paper describing the five whip-ray tapeworms, and that she was doing me the honor of naming one of them for me. Now, at last, the &lt;a href="http://www.paru.cas.cz/folia/detail.php?id=21275"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; has come out in the journal &lt;em&gt;Folia Parasitologica&lt;/em&gt;. Meet &lt;em&gt;Acanthobothrium zimmeri&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/files/2009/07/zimmeri-anatomy.jpg" alt="zimmeri-anatomy.jpg" align="left"&gt;I’m happy to report that &lt;em&gt;A. zimmeri&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent parasite. It has the bizarre anatomy that you’d expect from a tapeworm–an animal that &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2007/02/19/build-me-a-tapeworm/"&gt;has abandoned&lt;/a&gt; brains, eyes, and mouth, and has turned its skin into inside-out intestines. Its head is festooned with a distinctive set of suckers, hooks, and muscular pads, which it presumably uses to clamp onto the gut of its host. Like other tapeworms, the rest of its tiny body (1.5 to 3.1 millimeters long) is made up mostly of segments, each of which carries both testes and ovaries. (I note, without comment, that each segment’s vagina is described as “thick-walled, sinuous.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first discovered I was going to have a species named for me, I was overwhelmed by delusions of grandeur. But at the parasitology meeting, I was quickly brought back down to Earth. Fyler mentioned to another tapeworm expert that she was naming a species for me, and he said, “Yeah, I guess that makes sense. &lt;em&gt;Acanthrobothrium&lt;/em&gt; is kind of tall and thin like you.”  Apparently naming species was not the hallowed ritual I imagined. It is actually rather routine, because biologists have so many species to name. In fact, species can be named for all sorts of odd reasons. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/12/22/for-your-listening-pleasure-darwin-and-linneaus-and-the-web-of-life/"&gt;Carl Linneaus&lt;/a&gt;, who first invented the whole two-part Latin name system we still use today, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94886658"&gt;liked to name weeds for his scientific enemies&lt;/a&gt;. Fyler named the other four tapeworms found in the whip-ray for (1) the ship that Caira and Jensen were on (&lt;em&gt;A. oceanharvestae&lt;/em&gt;), (2) her grandfather “Pop” (&lt;em&gt;A. popi&lt;/em&gt;), (3) James Rodman at the National Science Foundation (&lt;em&gt;A. rodmani&lt;/em&gt;), and (4) Jim Romanow, who took care of the microscopes Fyler used (&lt;em&gt;A. romanowi&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still grateful for Fyler’s gesture, and I still can’t help feeling some vaguely paternal pleasure at seeing how &lt;em&gt;A. zimmeri&lt;/em&gt; helps scientists learn a little bit more about the diversity of life and how that diversity evolved. Fyler and her colleagues compared its DNA to other &lt;em&gt;Acanthobothrium&lt;/em&gt; species and discovered something interesting: the five species that live in the one fish are not closely related to each other. Instead, their closest relatives live in other whip-rays. Somehow their ancestors must have made the leap from one host to another, and somehow they must have made a place for themselves in the crowded ecosystem that is the inside of a whip-ray’s gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, that leap remains almost entirely a mystery. Scientists have no idea what sort of life cycle &lt;em&gt;A. zimmeri&lt;/em&gt; and its relatives have–what happens to the eggs that are released from the whip-rays, or what other hosts they may have to invade first before finally ending up in another whip-ray. Like its whip-ray host, &lt;em&gt;A. zimmeri&lt;/em&gt;’s intermediate hosts probably have yet to get a name of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope some day scientists do figure out my namesake’s lifecycle, but I also worry that their time may be running out. Whip-rays, like many other rays and sharks, are in &lt;a href="http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?id=15392"&gt;serious trouble&lt;/a&gt; these days thanks to reckless overfishing. And whenever one species becomes extinct, it can take other species with it. Switching host species is an exquisitely rare event, and so it’s likely that &lt;em&gt;A. zimmeri&lt;/em&gt; can only live in one species of whip-ray. When its host goes, it may disappear as well. Extinction is inevitable in the grand scheme of history: all species disappear after several million years, give or take. I just hope that &lt;em&gt;A. zimmeri&lt;/em&gt;, along with the rest of the world’s diversity, doesn’t go sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Carl Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/feed/</id><title type="html">The Loom</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247089370581"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/08/pz-myers-review-of-ua/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b799a2347015dd49</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">PZ Myers’ Review of UA…</title><published>2009-07-08T21:03:35Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T21:03:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/08/pz-myers-review-of-ua/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a take that throughly trashes the book, well then this is it. But of course, that’s not surprising, given that the book not only criticizes Myers but, indeed, identifies him as part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, someone perusing the reviews so far might wonder, how is it that &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/"&gt;Michael Mann of RealClimate&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/07/unscientific_america_by_chris.php"&gt;Chad Orzel&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/islandofdoubt/2009/07/unscientific_america_isnt_the.php"&gt;James Hrynyshyn&lt;/a&gt; like the book, but PZ Myers (someone criticized in it) does not? Let’s quote Mann on his own blog, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/07/unscientific-america-a-review/#comment-130232"&gt;after someone linked to Myers’ review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PZ Myers strongly disagrees, calling the book “utterly useless”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, he does. I respect PZ views on many matters. Here however, even by his own admission, his objectivity is likely compromised: He is at the receiving end of a fair degree of criticism in the book. The subjects explored in the book, especially the delicate and often awkward intersection of science and religion, tend to excite great passion and fierce disagreements. I’ll let my appraisal of the book stand on its own merit, but I’d encourage folks to read the book and form their own opinions. -mike]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We certainly agree. Indeed, it appears that judging the book based on what New Atheists say about it, alone, could lead you to make pretty strong factual errors about its contents. Consider what happens in &lt;a href="http://kazez.blogspot.com/2009/07/atheism-loud-and-quiet.html"&gt;this blog comment thread&lt;/a&gt; to one Jim Lippard: see &lt;a href="http://kazez.blogspot.com/2009/07/atheism-loud-and-quiet.html?showComment=1246803024615#c8570677518989782012"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://kazez.blogspot.com/2009/07/atheism-loud-and-quiet.html?showComment=1246835073037#c6362466844516425601"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://kazez.blogspot.com/2009/07/atheism-loud-and-quiet.html?showComment=1246902069468#c427129326185644321"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and finally &lt;a href="http://kazez.blogspot.com/2009/07/atheism-loud-and-quiet.html?showComment=1246987650748#c607834270675332414"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;–where after making various false claims about our book’s contents, Lippard admits to not having read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps judging a book critical of the New Atheists based on what the New Atheists say about it on blogs it is hazardous to your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have much more to say about Myers’ criticisms of the book soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Mooney</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/feed/</id><title type="html">The Intersection</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247088464365"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3036070768804518015.post-853942304717598076">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1ade92b5f2142747</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">A Response To Jerry</title><published>2009-07-08T20:35:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T20:36:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.nap.edu/~r/x-changefiles/~3/BRvfHERFw5g/response-to-jerry_08.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/feeds/853942304717598076/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/07/response-to-jerry_08.html#comment-form" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://blog.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/2009/07/response-to-jerry_08.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/blog" type="html">&lt;img src="http://www.scienceandentertainmentexchange.org/Janet%20crop%2075.jpg" align="left" style="margin:0 5px 5px 0"&gt;Well Jerry, you’ve done it again. And not just in bringing to light Jessica Alba’s groundbreaking work, most of which was conducted in between takes on Fantastic Four 2: the search for a spin-off. No, what you have proposed is much bigger than Miss Alba’s theories into time and space. Using the fool-proof Hollywood studio method of nurturing creativity and ingenuity and applying it to the science community? Brilliant! I was such a fan of this idea that after reading your blog I quickly jumped in my car, made sure my precious dogs were strapped in, remembered I had forgotten my BlackBerry, hurried to my office only stopping off at the gym, the coffee shop on Montana Avenue, a few boutiques, a breakfast meeting at Urth Café, back to the gym to see if my BlackBerry was there (it wasn’t), then to my office. There was no time to spare; I was inspired and my work was about to begin. As soon as I could find my blackberry that is!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The timing could not have been better. See, I was planning on going out with a pitch. To those in the science community, “going out with a pitch” is basically the equivalent of giving birth to a beautiful baby, then having a series of doctors inspect it, only to be told how hideous the child is until finally one lone nurse says how beautiful she thinks the baby is, leading to every doctor changing their minds, claiming the baby is beautiful and bidding on the rights to the baby. That was my goal this week, to sell my baby to the highest bidder. But after I read your blog, I thought, why not sell my baby to scientists.  Scientists who could—on their own without any sheep mentality—appreciate my baby for how beautiful it really is. I told my office we were going to sell a baby to a scientist and find my BlackBerry. Today was shaping up quite nicely.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I informed my office to bump Fox, bump Universal, bump Warner, Sony, Paramount, Disney, DreamWorks, etc., and instead line up meetings at MIT, Johns Hopkins, and Berkeley. Surprisingly enough, none of these universities were in my contacts. The first obstacle had been reached. Luckily, there was the Science &amp;amp; Entertainment Exchange to come to the rescue. They were able to set up pitch meetings with the heads of these prestigious universities, who all just happened to be in Los Angeles that day, right away without any problems. This was extremely helpful, because I had my office spending their efforts searching for my BlackBerry. Without The Exchange, everything might have fallen apart!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pitch was set and I walked into that room full of confidence. The scientists who awaited me were the best and the brightest, and therefore the perfect audience to pitch my movie. As I launched into the idea, I could see their eyes fill with the possibilities. We could go after Brad or Leo for the role of Chase Manly, the space fighter pilot who may be Earth’s last hope. For the headstrong physicist, we could approach Cate, Kate, or any other A-List actress nominated for multiple Oscars whose name is short for Katharine. Or Catherine. Or Quatherine. What a space fighter pilot and a physicist have to do with the rom-com set in Santa Fe that I pitched them, I don’t know, but something great was hatched in this meeting. Whether it was science improving entertainment or entertainment enhancing science, we’ll never know. Either way, with just a few minor rewrites, we were looking at a huge box office, with critical acclaim and awards all but guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I waited with bated breath as the heads of the science community discussed. Finally, an offer was made! There were a few change: the aliens wouldn’t speak French slang, but instead an actual made up language, time travel had to be presented in a realistic way (more Back to the Future than Austin Powers), and the use of cloning could not just be thrown in as a twist in the end. Also, they suggested adding in a robotic duck because it’s proven to increase box office take by $5 million domestic, their words. I agreed and a baby was sold!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m currently out on set, shoot day 158 on this movie. Slightly over budget and over schedule but the dailies look amazing and Quatherine’s performance is mesmerizing. And the best part is the entire project is scientifically accurate. See, The Exchange works!

There's been quite &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/10/981031181106.htm"&gt;a bit of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autoimmunity-autism-and-a-mothers-responsibility/"&gt;speculation&lt;/a&gt; about whether autistic children might have &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autoimmunity-autism-and-a-mothers-responsibility/"&gt;abnormally functioning immune systems&lt;/a&gt;; some alternative biomedical treatments  (such as &lt;a href="http://www.autism-world.com/index.php/2007/03/24/anti-fungal-treatment-for-autism/"&gt;anti-fungal treatment&lt;/a&gt;) are based on these theories. It's also been suggested that &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/autoimmunity-autism-and-a-mothers-responsibility/"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt; in expectant mothers might be linked to autism in a child. A  new &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_86486.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the July 6th online edition of &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; has found that children whose mothers have type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease---all autoimmune diseases---could be at up to three times a greater risk for autism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at the &lt;a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/"&gt;Department of Mental Health at the Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; at Johns Hopkins University. &lt;a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_86486.html"&gt;Medline Plus&lt;/a&gt; summarizes the results of the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[William W.] Eaton's team collected data on 3,325 Danish children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, including 1,089 diagnosed with infantile autism. The children were born between 1993 and 2004, and their data was part of the Danish National Psychiatric Registry. Data on family members with autoimmune diseases came from the Danish National Hospital Register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that children whose mothers had autoimmune disease were at a higher risk of developing autism spectrum disorder than children of mothers who did not have these conditions. In addition, the risk of infantile autism was increased in children with a family history of type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased risk that autoimmune diseases contribute to autism is not huge, Eaton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The increased risk for type 1 diabetes is a little less than two times, for rheumatoid arthritis it's about 1.5 times and for celiac disease it's more than three times," Eaton said. "That's enough to impress an epidemiologist, but not enough to make anybody in the general population start changing their behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction between the study's findings about autoimmunity and the (not yet possible) application of these findings to actual treatment is notable. Very often advocates will call for studies and research to figure or find out some issue, but the gap between these studies and actual, practical applications remains and parents are not always aware of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists are, I think, prudent to point this out. It seems that it is becoming possible to know about a child being autistic &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/knowing_about_autism_earlier_earlier_earlier"&gt;earlier and earlier&lt;/a&gt;. There've been plenty of reports in the media about &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/measles-cases-up-vaccinations-down/"&gt;parents choosing not to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; a child for fear of the child "getting" autism. Could studies like this new one in &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; lead to parents with diabetes, celiac disease, or rheumatoid arthritis being unduly anxious about the "risks" their children might face?  It's essential to distinguish between the long-term and "bigger picture" aspects of this and other study's findings, even as it's important to be able to plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eaton also notes that "children who are born underweight or premature are at higher risk for autism, and both of these obstetric problems are associated with celiac disease"----Charlie was full-term and 8 pounds, 3 ounces. You just never know.&lt;/p&gt;

And there’s a lot of info out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is more for me, just to gather everything that’s been happening in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;: Back in April, Article 40 of the Irish Constitution said that “The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent material is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was very vague.  (What constitutes “blasphemy”?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Minister &lt;strong&gt;Dermot Ahern&lt;/strong&gt; decided to &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0429/1224245599892.html?via=mr"&gt;correct this vagueness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern proposes to insert a new section into the Defamation Bill, stating: “A person who publishes or utters blasphemous matter shall be guilty of an offence and &lt;strong&gt;shall be liable upon conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €100,000&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Blasphemous matter” is defined as matter “that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion&lt;/strong&gt;, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion; and he or she intends, by the publication of the matter concerned, to cause such outrage.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After outrage from more sensible people than he, Ahern decided to amend his own proposed Blasphemy Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The €100,000 fine remained intact, but check out #3 in the revised law below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A person who publishes or utters blasphemous matter shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable upon conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €100,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the purposes of this section, a person publishes or utters blasphemous matter if (a) he or she publishes or utters matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion, and (b) he or she intends, by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned, to cause such outrage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for &lt;strong&gt;the defendant to prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you could prove that your blasphemy has artistic merit, you’re off the hook.  It sounds even vaguer than before… what type of blasphemy would not be allowed?  Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, creators of a TV show called &lt;em&gt;Father Ted&lt;/em&gt; decided that if the law passed, they would &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/05/father-ted-blasphemy-laws"&gt;issue a statement&lt;/a&gt; “blaspheming all the major religions in Ireland, including Christianity and Islam.”  It would be a pointed challenge to the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Blasphemy Law &lt;a href="http://blasphemy.ie/2009/07/08/dail-passes-blasphemy-law/"&gt;passed in the Dáil&lt;/a&gt; (the Irish version of the House of Representatives).  The penalty was also reduced to €25,000.   Only &lt;a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0708/libel.html"&gt;an hour was allotted&lt;/a&gt; to debate the blasphemy portion of the libel laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, it will be put to vote in the Seanad (the Irish version of the Senate).  If it passes there, the President can sign it into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have to explain why this is dangerous precedent.  Everyone who calls out religion for being superstitious at best and dangerous at worst is liable to be sued.  Any litigious, religious people could cite just about anything as being offensive to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, the Seanad consists of more sensible minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information on all of this can be found at &lt;a href="http://blasphemy.ie/"&gt;blasphemy.ie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

On the first day of the last term of summer school that he attended to three years ago, he cried and cried when I dropped him off. “Camp? Camp?” he often said over the winter when we passed the building, where he caught the bus to camp. Of course, during the same period he could never pass a school building without darting up the steps and peering through the windows. It was, as always, difficult to know exactly what he wanted based on what he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:510px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/files/2009/07/school-bus.jpg" alt="school-bus" width="500" height="357"&gt;&lt;p&gt;photo courtesy of Bill Ward&amp;#39;s Brickpile (flickr.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before summer school, I took him by the school he’d be attending (he knew the building, and had been there many times for school district parties, even though he attended a different elementary school). He darted again, right to the locked doors (it was Sunday); he pulled on them and pulled on them, and when they didn’t budge he darted to another set of doors and tried those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“School? School?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not today, Alex. They’re closed. Tomorrow, YOU GO TO SCHOOL!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seemed to delight him. A few hours later, when due to my lack of foresight we wandered past the camp building, he only ran to the door to the look in for a moment and said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wouldn’t have hesitated about day camp if Alex had seemed to love the entire experience last year. But, aside from a loving counselor who still sometimes babysits for us, trips to water parks, and bouncing on a bungee contraption called “The Flying Squirrel”, Alex didn’t seem to like to even participate in many of camp’s activities. And camp was $5,000. Know how many water parks we can hit this summer for $5,000?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“School?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tomorrow, Alex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning, Alex popped up at 6. “He’s excited,” Jill said, and later that morning she reported that he’d been “delighted” to start school. This morning, I took him down to the bus and he wiggled with excitement as the bus pulled up. We wiggled with having guessed right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the economy is… well, not awesome right now.  I’m learning to be a little more careful with my spending, but I’m still seemingly overwhelmed with my financial obligations: student loans, car payment, bills bills bills, and of course all the random stuff that just so happens to pop up out of nowhere. I really do wish I could come up with some brilliant idea, either a service or a product, to patent and sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So get creative! &lt;strong&gt;If you could come up with a product/service and sell it (assuming people would buy it), what would it be? Who would it benefit? And what would you do with your profits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader &lt;strong&gt;Doug&lt;/strong&gt; is a Louisiana resident who writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am very much in favor of the police working to reduce crime, and an obvious way to do that is to have a relationship with institutions that may be able to positively influence potential criminals.  However, having police involvement to the extent of working WITH religious institutions as a distribution center for religious activities and even aiding them in fund raising is going over the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if this involvement later lead to police biases in the community such as the protection of abortion clinics, prosecution of child molesting priests, the regulation of gay rallies, etc?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He put it in his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out at the 0:30 mark of this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/BTH9b6YJ6mc%26color1%3D0xb1b1b1%26color2%3D0xcfcfcf%26hl%3Den%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://telegraphjournal.canadaeast.com/front/article/722036"&gt;the uproar begins&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Monsignor Brian Henneberry, vicar general and chancellor in the Diocese of Saint John, wants to know whether the prime minister consumed the host and, if not, what happened to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Harper accepted the host but did not consume it, “it’s worse than a faux pas, it’s a scandal from the Catholic point of view,” he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/steven_harper_call_me.php"&gt;PZ&lt;/a&gt; and others on this: it’s just a cracker and while Catholic can give it whatever symbolic meaning they wish, the rest of us can choose to be realistic about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume a couple things.  One, since Harper is an evangelical Christian, he probably doesn’t buy into the cracker-is-really-the-body-of-Christ nuttiness.  Two, he doesn’t put himself in many situations in which he is offered a Communion Wafer so he probably doesn’t know the proper protocol to refuse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really, what options did Harper have?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either he publicly shuns the wafer because he’s not Catholic — and Catholics would’ve been offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or he takes it and eats it — and because he’s not Catholic, Catholics would’ve been offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or he takes it and pockets it in order to not cause a scene.  Which he did.  And now Catholics are offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what else he could’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this is a big story in Canada… but can you imagine the Catholic reaction in America if this happened to President Obama?&lt;br&gt;

This newborn thing has been the center of their life, and will continue to be, for some time; and one naturally presumes that the rest of the world shares one’s fascination with it.  This presumption, alas, may not always be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard that &lt;a href="http://preposterousuniverse.com/eternitytohere/"&gt;I have a book coming out&lt;/a&gt; — pushed back to January, unfortunately.  I haven’t shown any hesitation in blogging about substantive questions related to the topic of the book, nor do I see any reason to.  And once it comes out I do want to do some sort of book club so that people can ask questions and have a conversation about what’s in the various chapters.  So there will be no shortage of book-related stuff here on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a whole ‘nother level of bookish miscellany — admiring the illustrations, having blurbs come in for the back cover, setting up public talks, and all that.  Now we’re pretty much into baby-picture territory; it might not be completely safe to assume that everyone else is as fascinated by all this as I am.  But you don’t want to deprive those who are, right?  So I’m sending all that stuff here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/From-Eternity-to-Here-The-Quest-for-the-Ultimate-Theory-of-Time/90477397556"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Eternity to Here&lt;/em&gt; Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will shield you from the worst of my enthusiasms.  A bit, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I’m at all sure that this is the right thing to do.  Back in my day, we didn’t have all these fancy social networks to play around in; you had your blog, and that was it.  Now there’s been a bit of proliferation, and there’s no question that it’s changing the landscape.  It can obviously be annoying to try to follow too many things at once, but on the other hand it’s nice to have more appropriate tools for distinct tasks.  In the old days, I wouldn’t think much of writing a blog post with an amusing link and little else.  Now I will just put that on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/seanmcarroll"&gt;my Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;.  So there are fewer blog posts overall, but the average amount of substance per post is higher.  Is this an improvement?  Not really sure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of bloggers have Twitter feeds where they link to every one of their blog posts, which seems &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/CynicalChris/status/2535098135"&gt;backwards&lt;/a&gt; to me.  (So I usually don’t subscribe to those folks — nothing personal.)  I once asked (on Twitter) whether people thought that was a useful service, and I received strong opinions on either side — but then I noticed that everyone who was in favor of linking to every blog post on Twitter was a blogger who linked to every one of their blog posts on Twitter.  So I resist.  But then again, I synchronize my Twitter feed to my Facebook status updates, which is considered unforgivably gauche in some circles.  So who am I to complain?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sean</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/feed/</id><title type="html">Cosmic Variance</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247078759870"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/steven_harper_call_me.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02e6e58e689e0f86</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Steven Harper, call me!</title><published>2009-07-08T18:58:58Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T18:58:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/zDOHRoGyDoI/steven_harper_call_me.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/steven_harper_call_me.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://thestar.blogs.com/politics/2009/07/good-icebreaker-for-conversation-with-the-pope.html"&gt;Canadian prime minister was caught on video pocketing a cracker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; the media are in a tizzy over this silly and inconsequential nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They sent me a copy of their new book, &lt;i&gt;Unscientific America: How Scientific Illiteracy Threatens Our Future&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465013058/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0465013058&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0465013058&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0465013058" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, with a strange request: "We hope that like Dr. Coyne, you will suspend judgment until reading the book, at which point we'll be interested to hear what you think." I was a bit offended; of course I was going to read it with an open mind. Why would they think it necessary to ask me to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was before I got to chapters 8 and 9, however, which open with very direct and personal attacks on me and on Pharyngula, atheists in general, and anyone who fails to offer religion its proper modicum of respect. "Oh, that's why they warned me," I realized, "it's like asking the victim of a hatchet job to hold still for a moment so they can get in a good whack." They definitely did need to request my forbearance, so I wouldn't just toss their hypocritical and ignorant paean to mealy-mouthedness in the trash right away, which was one perceptive moment on their part. And yes, I freely admit that my opinion of the book is colored by the palpable contempt they hold for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I get ahead of myself. As I said, the discombobulating assault didn't begin until chapter 8, but the problems I had with the book started much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is completely baffling. They chose to illustrate the serious problem of the disconnect between a science-illiterate public and the science establishment with a strange example: the redesignation of Pluto as a non-planet. This event was accompanied by a public outcry, by people who had some peculiar emotional attachment to the idea that Pluto was the ninth planet, an attachment that was fed by a willing media that found this level of trivia to be about as complex an issue as they could handle. We &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that certain topics rouse the public, and often it's unpredictable what will catch the fancy of the news. But this? This is the opening story on which they build their argument that "consequences of the science-society divide may prove far more damaging"? And what do they propose we should do to resolve the issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I am first taken aback. They come down on the side of Pluto being redesignated as a planet! Why, is not clear — they clearly list the scientific reasons why astronomers thought it didn&amp;#39;t merit the title of &amp;quot;planet&amp;quot; — but they talk over and over about &amp;quot;rifts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;conflicts&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;danger of being seen as an Adlai Stevenson egghead&amp;quot;. Apparently, the sin of the scientists was a failure to bow before popular opinion, and insufficient attention to the PR consequences of a scientific decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Chris and Sheril, what should the astronomers have done? Should they have had a binding referendum delivered to the public to get their say? Are there other scientific matters that should be decided by popular vote? (Let's put the truth of evolutionary biology up for decision in a poll!) Should scientists take the time to explain with a little wit and humor and sound scientific reasoning why they made that decision? If so, they missed the boat: they should read Neil deGrasse Tyson's &lt;i&gt;The Pluto Files&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393065200/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0393065200&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0393065200&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0393065200" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for exactly that. How about some discussion about exactly why they think that failed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter was symptomatic of the deficiencies of the whole book. We&amp;#39;re told over and over about how scientists suck at the job of science communication (which is largely true), and that we need more media- and politically-savvy scientists (definitely true), but then…what? Apparently the job of these science diplomats of the future is to bow to the will of the people, and tell the nerds back in the lab what they should be doing. And of course, one of the keys to being a successful media scientist is to show the proper deference and respect to cultural conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan is their hero, and he's one of mine, too. He's the model of the scientist who is also both a skilled communicator and an activist, and I would agree entirely that we need more like him. However, they fail to notice the peculiar disjunction in their story: while reciting the wonderful efforts of Sagan and praising his skills and efforts, they're also telling the story of the dismal state of science education &lt;i&gt;at the same time&lt;/i&gt;. Strange…the object of their praise was influencing many of us growing up at that time, those of us who were already enthusiastic about science, but the culture was not improving, and was even getting worse. Is it possible that perhaps the problem does not lie entirely in the minimal PR skills of scientists, but in greater institutional forces at work in our society? The religious right was not glued to their TV sets every night that &lt;i&gt;Cosmos&lt;/i&gt; was on, you know. Sagan was preaching to the choir, and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that — it can be a powerful tool for motivating and informing a wider cadre of science communicators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book entirely neglects the anti-scientific forces. Our salvation apparently lies entirely in the hands of scientists who quietly promote the positive values of the scientific outlook, while turning their eyes away from deep-rooted values and institutions that directly threaten science. To challenge those would be to &lt;i&gt;offend&lt;/i&gt; people! And if we offend anyone, we lose! It&amp;#39;s an exceptionally defeatist attitude in which they plainly recognize a serious problem in American society — it&amp;#39;s the premise of the whole book! — but at the same time, demands that we avoid addressing the structural roots of those problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's even in the weirdly oblivious conclusion to the whole book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is not merely culture's "essential component", and we don't just have to mend the rift between science and culture: We have to create a perfect union. Science itself must become the common culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can agree wholeheartedly with that sentiment…but how, exactly, are we to accomplish it without challenging anti-scientific attitudes? Like the Pluto incident, what Mooney and Kirshenbaum seem to want is that science conform itself to that common culture, that somehow science will accommodate itself to the popular will, and everyone will be happy. They lack the realization that what they&amp;#39;re actually proposing is a rather radical change in cultural values, and that that will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; come without some pain and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another blind spot is present throughout the book, but particularly in the chapters where they excoriate the &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot;. They regard Dawkins with considerable distaste (but at least they spare him the outright contempt they give to me!), and at the same time they bemoan the lack of great science communicators since we lost Sagan. Wait, what? Are they aware at all that Dawkins is an excellent and popular writer, that he has sold millions of books and has made a number of documentaries? That he&amp;#39;s taken good advantage of the web? I&amp;#39;d be curious to know who has sold more books, Dawkins or Sagan, but if I had to bet on one it would be Dawkins. He has critics and even enemies, including Mooney and Kirshenbaum, but that&amp;#39;s irrelevant — they know that Sagan was also strenuously vilified by critics on the Right and among the religious, as well, yet somehow that opposition is regarded as the defining element of Dawkins&amp;#39; popularity, yet is overlooked in the case of Sagan. Scientists will always be delivering hard truths; if our hypothetical desired media-savvy science communicator cannot make anyone uncomfortable, then he or she is a failure at science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there's this exasperating nonsense, in which Mooney and Kirshenbaum are discussing how to get science into the popular media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawkins and some other scientists fail to grasp that in Hollywood, the story is paramount—that narrative, drama, and character development will trump &lt;b&gt;mere factual accuracy&lt;/b&gt; every time, and by a very long shot. [emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Mooney and Kirshenbaum fail to grasp is that to a scientist, factual accuracy must be paramount; it is not a matter on which we can compromise. Further, what they fail to recognize, and what they excuse for Hollywood, as that &lt;i&gt;accuracy does not have to compromise narrative, drama, and character!&lt;/i&gt; They berate Dawkins as if he has no awareness of the basics of what makes a good story, which makes me wonder if they&amp;#39;ve read any of his books at all — do they think he simply drily recites a body of abstract thoughts at the reader?

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that Mooney and Kirshenbaum&amp;#39;s book recites the obvious at us, that there is a fundamental disconnect between science and the popular imagination in our country, but offers no new solutions, and in fact would like to narrow our options to a blithe and accommodating compromise of science with rampant ignorance. Their own bigotry blinds them to a range of approaches offered by the &amp;quot;New Atheists&amp;quot;…a group that is not so closed to the wide range of necessarily differing tactics that such a deep problem requires as Mooney and Kirshenbaum are. It&amp;#39;s not a badly written book, but it&amp;#39;s something worse: it&amp;#39;s utterly useless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/unscientific_america_how_scien.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/PNF4wqtpoeE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247077298978"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/scienceonline09_interview_with_10.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5a3c277bbe97d5b6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'09"/><title type="html">ScienceOnline'09: Interview with Stephanie Zvan</title><published>2009-07-08T16:48:40Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T16:48:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/QmuVbCT75bc/scienceonline09_interview_with_10.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/07/scienceonline09_interview_with_10.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/sbc08_interviews/" title=""&gt;The series of interviews&lt;/a&gt; with some of the participants of the 2008 Science Blogging Conference was quite popular, so I decided to do the same thing again this year, posting interviews with some of the people who attended &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/" title=""&gt;ScienceOnline'09&lt;/a&gt; back in January. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I asked Stephanie Zvan of the &lt;a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Almost Diamonds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/" title=""&gt;Quiche Moraine&lt;/a&gt; blogs and co-moderator of the session on &lt;a href="http://www.scienceonline09.com/index.php/wiki/Science_Fiction_on_Science_Blogs/" title=""&gt;Science Fiction on Science Blogs&lt;/a&gt;, to answer a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Welcome to A Blog Around The Clock. Would you, please, tell my readers a little bit more about yourself? Who are you? What is your (scientific) background?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one of the least scientific backgrounds of the people attending SO'09. What background I do have is in the social sciences, which makes me even more of an outlier. I have a degree in psychology that taught me a remarkable amount about research design, however, and I've never really gotten over that. In fact, it kept me from following my intended path of becoming certified for counseling. It turned out there just wasn't any good evidence that most counseling had any lasting effect (which has since changed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, well, I'm terrible at describing myself and make no guarantees of consistency anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;What do you want to do/be when (and if ever) you grow up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I'll ever be content to do just one thing, but I want to write more than I do. Writing brings in no income at this point, so it's relegated to the sidelines more than I like. Ideally, my young adult science fiction novel will find a publisher and sell well to a bunch of kids who scream for more. We'll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;What is your Real Life job?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="szvan.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/szvan.jpg" width="270" height="204" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Aside from saying that I'm an analyst who works for a large corporation, I don't talk about my job. The information I deal with is interesting enough that I see my work in the news sometimes, but ultimately, none of it is mine, and the clients I work with shouldn't ever stumble across me online and worry that some of it might become public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And apropos of the panel on blogging and employers, that was made clear to me when I started with my company. It's a general policy, but it doesn't take much imagination to apply it to blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;What aspect of science communication and/or particular use of the Web in science interests you the most?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm a communication geek, so it all interests me. It's fascinating to watch the tower walls fall and see people collaborating, commiserating and debating simply because the informality of most blogs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;How does (if it does) blogging figure in your work? How about social networks, e.g., Twitter, FriendFeed and Facebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a fiction writer, some kind of dynamic online presence is a requirement these days. Well, that's not true if your books debut on the NYT bestsellers list, but it is the standard advice. Blogging started as self-promotion for me, but I'm terrible at self-promotion. The blog didn't really gel until I started talking about the social, political and economic topics I'm actually interested in. Discussion of contentious topics online may not be the best way to attract an audience for young adult fiction, but I'm not sure I can do anything else and still blog with any frequency or interest for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been on Facebook for over a year and Twitter for a couple of months. Both have ended up as a combination of news feed and free-ranging silly conversation. That suits me perfectly, but I have no idea how or whether that connects to my work beyond keeping me informed and entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;What are your thoughts on the never-ending debates between groups of people who are generally on the same side, but differ in one tiny detail, usually of strategy? For example, in the evolution/creation debate, silent vs. vocal atheists, or different strands of feminism (including the question of women in STEM), people who are on the same page 99% of the time, spend a lot of time aggressively arguing the remaining 1%?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is your revenge for me &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/this_morning_on_the_radio_-_po.php"&gt;asking you about science journalism&lt;/a&gt; on the radio without giving you time to prep, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there's a certain inevitability to this. There are lots of ways to talk about what's going on, but being me, I'll talk about it in terms of voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The places where I see these 1% arguments are in groups of people whose voices have traditionally been suppressed or marginalized. Feminists', immigrants', poor peoples' and racial and sexual minorities' voices have been ignored, cut off and dismissed. Atheists have been drowned out by the hue and cry the religious raise every time we've reminded them we exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being heard has become easier and is becoming easier, but it is still not easy. Blogs, etc. give us a great place to speak, but speaking doesn't guarantee that anyone will listen. Even the people who do read us won't necessarily work very hard to understand us. In fact, since we're saying unfamiliar and uncomfortable things, they have a vested interest in misreading us. We've all had a reader who comes along and leaves a comment that makes us say, "You thought I said &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;99% of the time, those are the people who want to continue to suppress all our voices. The other 1%, they're us. (Actually, considering how internet audiences self-select, it's significantly more than 1%.) In the middle of an ongoing fight, it's very difficult to remember that disagreeing about 1% means that we are in the same place on the fundamentals. We're even in the same place on a great many of the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1% is noise. It's nuances and connotations of words. It's different cultural definitions of politeness. It's varying priorities on a common to do list. It's not restating all the things we have in common every time we want to speak. It's shaping messages for different groups of people who still aren't at 75%, much less 99%. It's hauling one argument out of the common pile on any given day instead of another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1% is not an attack, not even in the middle of a battle. In fact, it's a sign that we're winning and that we're doing something very important as we win. We are, after all, trying to build a world in which it's okay for people to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we do about all the drama? Oh, hell, why ask me? Oh, right. Because I'll answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don't know what we do. I think the answer lies in spending some time picturing what a world in which everyone gets a voice really looks like. It's a scary place in some ways. There aren't any guarantees that it will make life better for any of us as individuals, although I have to uncomfortably admit that those of us with strong or persuasive voices will likely be disproportionally privileged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that those of us who have those voices are going to have to figure out is how to balance being forceful (or charming or cutting) enough to overcome society's dominant messages with creating an atmosphere in which the quieter and more awkward voices aren't shouted down. I think some of the arguments that are happening are steps in the direction of figuring this out, but I don't think anyone has the answers right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;When and how did you discover science blogs? What are some of your favourites? Have you discovered any new cool science blogs while at the Conference?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hanging out in the science fiction and fantasy blogosphere, I don't remember where, when someone posted a link to something cool at &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/cognitivedaily/"&gt;Cognitive Daily&lt;/a&gt;. My degree is in psychology, and I'm fascinated by the test required to tease out effects in cognitive psych. I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I discovered there was more to ScienceBlogs and much more to the science blogosphere, and I was doomed. I didn't really discover much new through the conference, but I did get a sense of just how widely I was already reading. One thing I did get to do at the conference was tell Greta and Dave Munger this story, which it had never occurred to me I'd be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;Is there anything that happened at this Conference - a session, something someone said or did or wrote - that will change the way you think about science communication, or something that you will take with you to your job, blog-reading and blog-writing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from meeting so many very cool people, two events stand out for me. One was having dinner with &lt;a href="http://inversesquare.wordpress.com/"&gt;Tom Levenson&lt;/a&gt; and discussing one of your journalism/new media posts, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/12/the_shock_value_of_science_blo.php"&gt;The Shock Value of Science Blogs&lt;/a&gt;. We both started off by saying there were parts of the post we disagreed with. Each of us was talking about a different part of the post, but as we went into more depth on the topic, neither of us really disagreed with the other. That really emphasized for me the level of detail at which some of these disagreements between allies happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that is imprinted on my memory is standing in the hallway as sessions were in progress. The door to one session opened, a session on impact factor or open access or one of the related issues on that topic, and a young woman came out. She said she needed more coffee to deal with the discussion. She walked that direction, stopped, and turned back toward me. She wasn't quite crying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I want to support open access. I think it's important, and I want to submit to open access journals. But if I don't submit to the big journals with high impact factors, how will I end up with a job and funding to keep researching and submitting? My adviser is young and new. How will she get tenure if we do this?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young always fight our revolutions, and we always lose some to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;b&gt;It was so nice to meet you and thank you for the interview. I hope to see you again next January.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was lovely and invigorating and exhausting to meet you too. I hope to be there. &lt;/p&gt;

This is the season  when our utility bills begin to skyrocket. Our costly electric bills often bring into focus the high demand our community has for energy, as well as questions about where electricity will be coming from in the future as North Carolina's population grows.  This will be the subject of our next cafe.  We will be meeting Dr. David McNelis from UNC-Chapel Hill's Institute for the Environment.  Dr. McNelis will give us information about options that we have for energy production in our future.  What are the safest and most viable options that we have to choose from?  Are there renewable energy sources that can meet our needs in North Carolina?  Here is a link to a collection of articles from the New York Times that may help you begin thinking about this complex and very important topic. (http://www.nytimes.com/ref/science/earth/energy.html).

&lt;p&gt;Energy for the Future&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday July 21, 2009&lt;br&gt;
6:30-8:30 p.m. with discussion beginning at 7:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;br&gt;
Tir Na Nog 218 South Blount Street, Raleigh, 833-7795&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does our energy future look like? As new options become available, how soon will we see a difference in transportation and in the supply and use of electricity in our homes and businesses? What are some realistic expectations we should have for the reduction of carbon emissions from energy use? Come to our café and join in on a discussion of energy sources for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor David N McNelis has over 45 years of environmental sciences and engineering experience in federal government, university and industry settings. He served in research and research management positions with the U.S. Army, the U.S. Public Health Service and the Environmental Protection Agency; with the Department of Energy's prime contractor for the Nevada Test Site; with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and now serves as the Director of the Center for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economic Development in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Institute for the Environment and as President of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Technologies, LLC. Currently he specializes in conventional, alternative and nuclear energy systems and technologies and the nuclear fuel cycle (including partitioning, transmutation, repository capacity and nuclear non proliferation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This café is sponsored by Progress Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

What does the bill, if it passes, actually &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;?  What are some of the practical applications for people on the spectrum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media Dis &amp;amp; Dat links into a post from School Transportation News headlined &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/07/federal-hate-crimes-bill-would-protect.html"&gt;Federal hate crimes bill would protect students with disabilities on school buses&lt;/a&gt;.  The article is just about the Matthew Shepard Act and doesn't mention school buses, but the fact that it was posted on a school transportation site implies that the school transportation folks are thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristina has followed some &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/student_beaten_by_another_child_on_school_bus"&gt;school bus abuse&lt;/a&gt; articles (and also &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/safety_concerns"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/left_behind_on_the_bus"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Without getting into details, people were not kind to me the yellow school bus 30+ years ago.  School bus hate crimes are a big problem, both past and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the bill is passed, those found guilty of injuring a person based on their disability could be imprisoned for up to 10 years. If a person is found guilty of killing, kidnapping or sexually abusing someone because of their disability, or even attempting any of the aforementioned crimes, the maximum prison sentence would be life. In addition to disabilities, the Matthew Shepard Act would protect people injured or murdered because of their actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why abuse of autistics continues is because the consequences of getting caught are often minimal, especially compared to the consequences if the abused person was in a privileged class.  So a bill like the Matthew Shepard Act would start helping some with that issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hate crimes and abuse are complex however; there may be more to it than just a piece of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, stronger sentencing is a huge step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247075976004"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14353">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5a411a479a33b16</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="economists"/><category term="Paul Krugman"/><category term="women"/><title type="html">Domo Arigato Missus Krugman</title><published>2009-07-08T17:30:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T17:30:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/domo-arigato-missus-krugman/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; columnist &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Gross&lt;/strong&gt; thinks he's &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2221974/"&gt;found the female embodiment of &lt;strong&gt;Paul Krugman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Japanese economist &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiVR0XE1Qtg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noriko Hama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247074930189"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/08/why-the-stem-cell-fight-should-at-last-be-over/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9003316266ab8d98</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics and Science"/><category term="Stem Cells"/><category term="Unscientific America"/><title type="html">Why the Stem Cell Fight Should, at Last, Be Over</title><published>2009-07-08T17:34:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T17:34:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2009/07/08/why-the-stem-cell-fight-should-at-last-be-over/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/07/stemming-the-controversy/"&gt;latest Science Progress column&lt;/a&gt; reacts to the new &lt;a href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/2009guidelines.htm"&gt;finalized stem cell guidelines&lt;/a&gt; promulgated by the National Institutes of Health this week. First, I give the background on Bush’s awful policy, finally superseded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bush administration’s increasingly unpopular policy, you’ll recall, stated that no stem cell lines derived from blastocysts after the date of the former president’s August 9, 2001 speech on the matter could be used in research receiving federal funds. This raised a host questions, both about ethics and also about coherence—for how could a rule based simply on which day Bush gave his speech have any moral authority?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy lacked scientific authority as well, as it was soon revealed that Bush’s promise of “more than sixty genetically diverse” stem cell lines for federally funded research was simply bogus and based on a gross overestimate of the number of available lines. There were really only 21, and “genetically diverse” was a dubious assertion to boot. So the Bush policy wound up constraining research far more than it had at first appeared, and far more than promised. This story of scientific carelessness (or worse) during the president’s nationally televised stem cell address has now been told and retold, and it further undermined the Bush policy: How could a decision made on the basis of incorrect information—and maintained doggedly in the face of contrary information—have any authority at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama policy is vastly better than this, on both the ethics and on the promotion of science:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/upload/2009/07/happy_blog-o-versary_to_me_now/aphrodite.jpg" alt="aphrodite.jpg" height="499" width="350"&gt;

&lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mensxp.com/UltimateEditorInclude/UserFiles/love%20gods/aphrodite.jpg"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;: Dr. Isis, in total unadulterated hotness, comes forth to sate the masses.  At the sight of her, the masses did rejoice for she was unlike any they had seen.
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Not knowing what to expect, I threw this little gem of deliciousness into the inter-webs to see if it would stick:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have maintained a blog with my "real persona" for years, but it has occurred to me lately that my friends and family don't really care to hear about my science musings. This is my outlet for all of the nerdy, geeky things I think are awesome but that people outside of science think are mundane.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have recently begun work at one of those universities that is pretty famous for its research and what-not. I have a husband and child and have given the occasional talk to young, female professionals about "balancing work and family." It has occured to me, especially when I am in the lab in the middle of the night, that there may be no such thing.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think that much like one can describe an electron based on either its velocity or position (but not both at the same), I can be described as either Dr. Isis or Mom (but not both at the same time).&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Stick it did. I was summarily greeted by &lt;a href="http://candidengineer.blogspot.com/"&gt;Candid Engineer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/"&gt;PhysioProf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://academiccrossroads.blogspot.com/"&gt;Academic Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; and I remember thinking to myself, &amp;quot;Wow! These total strangers came over here to read this stuff? I must be hotter than I thought!&amp;quot;  Then &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2008/07/blogrolling_on_becoming_a_dome.php"&gt;DrugMonkey showed up&lt;/a&gt; and the hi jinx erupted.
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Life is generally not much different for me since that first post.  I&amp;#39;ve settled into my new MRU, Mr. Isis has found a job and is happy doing it, Little Isis is in school, and I am still figuring out how to defy the laws of physics and be Mom and Dr. Isis at the same time.  The only difference is that now there are substantially more online shenanigans in my life and an outlet for ass shaking jams, shoes, and science-y sounding meanderings. 
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="justify"&gt;But we can talk more about me and how amazing I am later.  I thought we would celebrate my blog-o-versary today by talking about you.  Ed Yong of Not Exactly Rocket Science started a meme a few days ago &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2008/07/spread_the_word.php"&gt;asking his readers&lt;/a&gt; to leave a comment telling him about who they are and why they read.  He writes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align="justify"&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I started this blog, the intention was to try and use well-written articles on cool discoveries to get people who wouldn't normally read science blogs to be interested in science. I've now been writing for almost two years and while traffic has grown, it strikes me that I still don't know a lot about my readership, or the ratio of non-scientists/scientists who come to these pages. &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So with that in mind, you can help me out by taking up these two challenges: &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1)&lt;strong&gt; Tell me about you&lt;/strong&gt;. Who are you? Do you have a background in science? If so, what draws you here as opposed to meatier, more academic fare? And if not, what brought you here and why have you stayed? Let loose with those comments. &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2)&lt;strong&gt; Tell someone else about this blog&lt;/strong&gt; and in particular, try and choose someone who's not a scientist but who you think might be interested in the type of stuff found in this blog. Ever had family members or groups of friends who've been giving you strange, pitying looks when you try to wax scientific on them? Send 'em here and let's see what they say. &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks folks. Game on. &lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/the_return_of_who_are_you_what.php"&gt;DrugMonkey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/who-the-fuck-are-you-people/"&gt;PhysioProf&lt;/a&gt; have joined in the game and it has certainly piqued my curiosity.  So why don&amp;#39;t you leave mama a comment and tell me a little something about who you are and why you keep coming around (this means you, you lurkers). 
  &lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;I mean, how could I turn down an opportunity to feed my own narcissism on my blog-o-versary?  Here&amp;#39;s a jam to get you started...
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Explaining “birds and bees.”  A late night phone call from the hospital.  And having to tell your 16-year-old daughter how you’re not going to let her drive, because you don’t want to &lt;a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/71423.html"&gt;have to arrest her&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In a country where women are barred from getting behind the wheel, his daughter’s desire is not only forbidden, it’s also a touchy subject for Gifari, who’s spent nearly half his life working for the government body charged with enforcing the law.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I told her that driving is allowed in Islam,” Gifari said in a rare interview with a Western reporter. “But it is more of a cultural thing. We already have a lot of problems on the road when it comes to sexual harassment, with guys flirting with girls in the car. If a woman drives, it’s only going to bring more problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Gifari, he appears to have the persuasive manner that’s so helpful in parenting:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As for his own daughter’s desire to drive a car, Gifari said, after a half-hour chat, she agreed with her dad that the timing wasn’t right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe in a few years traditions will change,” Gifari said. “But right now it’s only going to bring problems — and it’s not one of the government priorities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he didn’t even have to &lt;a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2008/09/15/father-kills-convert-daughter-and-this-isnt-news/"&gt;cut out her tongue&lt;/a&gt;!

And germs go to Heaven?&lt;br&gt;
Spiders, snakes and sperms go to Heaven?&lt;br&gt;
It’s quite expected that they’re not resurrected,&lt;br&gt;
‘Cause man created God.

You Can Leave During “God Bless America” Now</title><published>2009-07-08T16:12:13Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T16:12:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/07/08/at-a-yankees-game-you-can-leave-during-god-bless-america-now/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, I mentioned a story about &lt;strong&gt;Bradford Campeau-Laurion&lt;/strong&gt;, who was &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/2009/04/15/man-sues-yankees-for-not-letting-him-use-bathroom-during-singing-of-god-bless-america/"&gt;kicked out of the old Yankee Stadium&lt;/a&gt; last August because “he tried to use the restroom during the playing of ‘God Bless America.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story now has a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601079&amp;amp;sid=aYhBxZdq44PU"&gt;move about during the song&lt;/a&gt; without worrying about any repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… The City of New York will pay the plaintiff, Bradford Campeau-Laurion, $10,001 and $12,000 to his lawyers in legal fees and costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This settlement ensures that the new Yankee Stadium will be a place for baseball, not compelled patriotism,” Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The New York Yankees have no obligation to pay any of the money,” Alice McGillion, a spokeswoman for the team, said in a phone interview today. “There is no policy change at the stadium. The policy remains as it always has been, that fans are free to move about during the playing of ‘God Bless America.’”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obviously the right verdict.  No one should be compelled to sing in favor of God or America.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if someone can explain why the plaintiff deserves $10,001, I’d love to know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

(Interestingly, this morning I noticed that the door was propped open with a traffic cone.)  And then it goes on:  &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Failure to do so will result in disciplinary actions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But… failure to do what?  What has gone wrong here?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Look at it again:&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table border="" cellpadding="7" width="80%"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not prop open this door for security reasons.  Failure to do so will result in disciplinary actions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verb phrase &lt;i&gt;do so&lt;/i&gt; is a conventional way of referring again to an action already referred to by a recent verb phrase in the discourse. The &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; can be regarded as an adverb, I think: just as &lt;i&gt;do likewise&lt;/i&gt; means "take a similar action to the one that was just mentioned", &lt;i&gt;do so&lt;/i&gt; does likewise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems to have gone wrong with the door sign is this: to make sense in the minatory context, the verb phrase that has to be picked up to provide the action that &lt;i&gt;do so&lt;/i&gt; refers to would have to be &lt;i&gt;not prop open this door&lt;/i&gt;.  That contains a negative.  And there is another implicit negative in the word &lt;i&gt;failure&lt;/i&gt;: a failure to do something amounts simply to not doing it.  (Using the root &lt;i&gt;fail&lt;/i&gt; conventionally carries the additional implication that either you were trying to do whatever it is or you should have been trying; but that doesn't alter the truth conditions, and we can ignore it for present purposes.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So &lt;i&gt;failure to do so&lt;/i&gt; in the context of the sign has to mean approximately "&lt;b&gt;not not&lt;/b&gt; propping open this door".  And reconstructing a verb phrase meaning with a straight double negation like that is too much to ask of our processing mechanisms (or at least, mine).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact for an instant I find I interpret &lt;i&gt;do so&lt;/i&gt; as "prop this door open", yielding the crazy meaning that you are not to do it but you will be subject to disciplinary action if you don't.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very sloppy interpretation of &lt;i&gt;failure to do so&lt;/i&gt;, based solely on what meaning would make sense in the context, could let it mean "failure to act like we just said", or "failure to obey this sign", or "failure to do right"; but the linguistic resources as we ordinarily deploy them do not really allow that.  For example, it would seem incoherent to tell someone &lt;sup&gt;??&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have repeatedly asked you not to call this number, but you have failed to do so&lt;/i&gt;.  You can only make sense of that sign by being extremely careless about the way we normally interpret &lt;i&gt;do so&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other points.  First, I misquoted the sign deliberately on one point in order to eliminate a distraction: it actually says "for security reason", not "for security reasons".  That's ungrammatical too.  It could be just a typo (the sign is a crude piece of amateur layout and 64-point laser printed capital letters), or it could be evidence that the wording was written by a non-native or inexpert speaker.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And second, the propped-open door with the warning on it is at the corner of Haste Street and Bowditch Street, just across the road from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Park"&gt;People's Park&lt;/a&gt;, and any of the homeless people and drug users who sleep there can slip in past the traffic cone right now and steal a delivery truck.  Though they shouldn't, and failure to do so will result in prosecution.  (You see what I mean?  That construction really isn't linguistically well formed.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

I’m not going to do a full recap, but just some highlights and some thoughts I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, my pics are &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/sets/72157621033419226/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the video, which I posted earlier and is maybe NSFW, is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmLdaBTFtoA"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second of all, I did pretty much nothing to prepare for this. Carrie, aka Carr2d2, came up with the idea of adding a Skepchick track to CONvergence, and then she did the bulk of the organizing, promoting, guest-wrangling, and party planning. She was amazing. AMAZING. Maria, Elyse, and Bug Girl did a fabulous job decorating the party room and mixing/distributing Buzzed Aldrin shots. We also got tons of help from some husbands and friends, like Tim, Christian, and Kammy. They all helped to make the parties ridiculously popular with the CONvergence crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went into this expecting us (as Skepchicks) to be a very small part of a very large sci-fi/fantasy conference, hosting panel talks in front of a handful of people and generally spending the weekend drinking amongst ourselves. Wrong. Sooo wrong. The panels were well-attended, with a few filling up the room even though we were up against other events like the MST3K Q&amp;amp;A. Sitting on the panels was tons of fun, interacting with people who were already fans as well as people who had never heard of us but were totally digging the topics. Our guests were whip-smart: Pamela Gay, Greg Laden, Melissa Kaercher, Stephanie Zvan, Karl Wolf, Charlotte Nickerson, and Matthew Bannerman were fab, tackling topics like Bigfoot, science online, and evolution with intelligence and wit. I learned a great deal from all of them in just a few days, from their panels as well as from hanging out with them outside the main events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the most time getting better acquainted with &lt;a href="http://www.starstryder.com/"&gt;Pamela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen"&gt;Greg&lt;/a&gt;, two people I’ve admired for a long time. I met Pamela once before when &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;a mutual friend&lt;/a&gt; introduced us, but had never met Greg. Pamela’s intelligence shines through in just about every word she says, with a knowledge base that extends far past the astronomical. Greg is not only also incredibly smart, but he has apparently lived six lives in a row and has amassed an impressive collection of stories from all around the globe. I absolutely cannot wait to hang out with both of them again, and I hope when we do it is once again in the company of the Skepchicks, unending Buzzed Aldrins, and 5,000 Klingons and Faeries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually after these sorts of events, I’m completely wiped out and want to curl into a ball for a week. But, in a few hours I’ll be leaving for Vegas to attend The Amaz!ng Meeting. The Skepchicks have been once again hard at work setting this up to be the Greatest. Event. Ever. Seriously. I can’t wait to get there and once again hang out with the ultra-smart cuties I love. If you’re coming, I hope you RSVPed for the Skepchick party Saturday night! If you’re in, visit the Skepchick or Skeptics’ Guide table to get info on how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I’ll be Tweeting about TAM, as will the rest of the Skepchicks, I suspect. Follow along if you’re not going to be there, and stay tuned for possible updates and live feeds here on the blog!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247070456641"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8939215957678466409">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e0693e8af800ec3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="My World" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">04:05:06 07/08/09</title><published>2009-07-08T15:14:00Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T15:54:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/07/040506-070809.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8939215957678466409/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8939215957678466409" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Shortly after 4 AM this morning you could write the exact time and date as 04:05:06 07/08/09.But only in America—and a few other countries [Date and time notation by country].In Europe you&amp;#39;ll have to wait until August 7th and if your country is unlucky enough to have adopted the international standard notation then you&amp;#39;ve missed the big day by two years.In Canada we use all three notations and</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247069576701"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/important_information_about_th.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec0b22e3d153d040</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Important information about the Creation “Museum” trip!</title><published>2009-07-08T17:04:50Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T17:04:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/xCMSgGddNvw/important_information_about_th.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/07/important_information_about_th.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be speaking at the Secular Student Alliance conference on 8 August, and before that, you may recall, I announced that we were going on a little field trip to Ken Ham's bunco joint in Kentucky, on Friday, 7 August. We're trying to organize a bit, so SSA sent me the notice below. Preregister and get a &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; discount on the entry fee, and SSA is also looking for more people to help with coordinating travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Register to get the $10 entry fee at &lt;a href="https://secularstudents.wufoo.com/forms/creation-museum-with-pz-myers-registration/"&gt;https://secularstudents.wufoo.com/forms/creation-museum-with-pz-myers-registration/&lt;/a&gt;.  You have to pay in advance but you get the $10 entrance rate, rather than the $22 that you'd have to pay at the door.   People have to register by 7/23 to get this rate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We're arranging carpools through &lt;a href="http://www.rideshare.us/"&gt;www.rideshare.us&lt;/a&gt; using lookup code PZ2Creation.  Anyone coming to the Museum and/or heading up to Columbus afterwards for the conference is strongly encouraged to post their rides if they'd be willing to take a student along with them.  Students can also post ads for rides if they need to get from one place to the other.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We also have some (free!) housing available in Columbus for Thurs night for any students from out of town who need a place to crash before heading down to the museum.  Interested parties should contact Jon the Intern In Charge of Housing at &lt;a href="mailto:jonathan.sussman@secularstudents.org"&gt;jonathan.sussman@secularstudents.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It started &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/07/who_are_you.php" title=""&gt;with Ed&lt;/a&gt;, and was picked up by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2009/07/the_return_of_who_are_you_what.php" title=""&gt;DM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2009/07/in_which_sci_is_stared_at.php" title=""&gt;Sci&lt;/a&gt;. So, let me ask again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Identify yourself in the comments. Even if you've never commented before, speak up. Who are you? Do you have a background in science? Are you interesting lay-person, practicing scientist, journalist, sentient virus, or something else?

&lt;i&gt;Kåreholm manor on the Slätbaken inlet in Östergötland, home of my friends the Danielsson family.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s there was a company (maybe several?) in Sweden whose business was to fly around rural areas and take aerial photographs of farms, mills, churches and small factories. Employees in pilot uniforms would then ride around in limousines and sell copies to the landowners. For an extra fee you could get yours hand-tinted by a pilot's wife in the suburb next to Bromma airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company didn't sell the negatives, and for most sites they didn't make a sale at all. So the company archives came to hold tens of thousands of aerial photographs of Swedish farms, most of which were never seen by anyone. But now the business has &lt;a href="http://flygfotohistoria.mine.nu/"&gt;re-opened on the web&lt;/a&gt;. No limo this time: you just browse the site's watermarked images and order copies of any photograph that catches your fancy. Invaluable for field archaeologists who need to know something about land use at the areal maximum of Swedish agriculture. Many of the fields in the pix are spruce plantations now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/07/1950s_aerial_pics_of_the_swedi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/GQGC3dm59S8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247065600184"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=14611">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2a02d1a2686472da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="animals"/><category term="art"/><category term="photography"/><title type="html">FREAK Shots: Bird Critics</title><published>2009-07-08T14:49:01Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T14:49:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/freak-shots-bird-critics/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">A &lt;a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1711791/pigeons_interpret_beauty_in_same_way_as_humans/"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; by a research team from Tokyo's Keio University found that pigeons can distinguish between paintings the researchers consider good and bad.</summary><author><name>By Freakonomics</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/rss2.xml</id><title type="html">Freakonomics » Blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.freakonomics.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1247064243107"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/what_a_difference_a_century_ca.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ced92795132c7547</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anthropology"/><title type="html">What a Difference a Century Can Make</title><published>2009-07-08T15:07:14Z</published><updated>2009-07-08T15:07:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/GregLadensBlog/~3/wjD17gN1LC8/what_a_difference_a_century_ca.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2009/07/what_a_difference_a_century_ca.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the 20th century, a traveler in Central Africa made mention of some strange people that he had come across. He was traveling among regular, run-of-the-mill natives...probably Bantu-speaking people living in scattered villages and farming for their food. But along the way, strange people came out of the forest. These strange people had sloping foreheads; they were short of stature, bow-legged and otherwise misshapen. They also clearly were, in the eyes of the traveler, of subhuman intelligence. The traveler described these people as a separate, subhuman race that lived in the forest. As I read this, I began to think that perhaps he was speaking of so-called "Pygmies" who live in this region, and as I began to think that, I started to get mad at this writer because so-called "Pygmies" do not look or act as he described. ...&lt;/p&gt;
