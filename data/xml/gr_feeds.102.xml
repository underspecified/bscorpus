&lt;p&gt;I know this is not news to anyone on this blog.  But experiencing a medical procedure this close up really gives you a better understanding of how freaking lucky we all are because of science.  There seems to be a general vibe in the media, movies and popular culture that science is dangerous and technology is bad. People tell us that we should back away from new media and new technology because these things are somehow de-humanizing. To those people, I say “Fuck off” and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s forget for a moment the incredible amount of technology and science that led to the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Let’s just focus on the procedure and hospital process itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In less than 48 hours, Christian went from having his throat sliced open to walking about, eating normally and resting comfortably at home.  Here are some of the things that allowed this ‘miracle of science’ to have occured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease"&gt;germ theory of disease&lt;/a&gt;. Until it was proposed that tiny, invisible creatures were running all over us and could be the cause of disease and infection, doctors and surgeons didn’t worry about hygiene and sterilization. Today, the hospital has an entire system in place to maintain a sterile environment in the surgery itself and to keep risk of infection to a minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sutures. Christian had his &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_7h-GXHufU3I/ScOJzLez4HI/AAAAAAAAADM/azv0XKhIP5M/s1600-h/photo-764224.jpg"&gt;THROAT SLICED OPEN&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, he has a wound across his neck and they sewed it up with some stuff that will just dissolve over time; no painful removal of stitches and minimal scarring.  He has some pain from the wound itself but that’s honestly been the least of his problems (the most pain was from the intibation tube down his throat during surgery).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pain medication. When he woke up he was in some pretty severe pain and his recovery would have been significantly prolonged and much harder without pain medication. He got all sorts of drugs, including morphine, loratab and some incredible stuff that made him feel better when the morphine wasn’t making a dent in his pain.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also occurred to me that there are a million tiny technologies to be grateful for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bendy straws.  It sounds silly, but when you have a wound in your neck, being able to drink without looking down is a big freaking deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crocs, NurseMates and the other brand name shoes that keep the nursing staff more comfortable and able to stay on their feet longer and be less cranky.  The nursing staff was fantastic, probably not just because of their shoes but isn’t it nice to have technology to make their daily lives easier?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjustable beds and chairs.  We could move his head up, down, forward and backwards, whatever we needed to get him into the right position to eat, sleep, breath better etc. (My only complaint was that the bed was too short for his 6′6″ frame).  And I got a fairly comfy recliner that I slept in overnight, which allowed me to be a lot less cranky in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blackberry, cell phone, wi-fi and laptop technology that allowed me to keep all our friends and family updated (more than they probably wanted!) about what was going on during the surgery and recovery.  Plus, IM, email, chat, Twitter, Facebook and text messages that all allowed for different methods to communicate. Suck it &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6458#comment-55392"&gt;Sam Ogden&lt;/a&gt;, I’m OK with having options! &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, you get my point, right? Technology and science rocks. Every minute and penny that people spend on bad science, pseudoscience, ‘alternative’ medicine and plain old bullshit is time and money that could be inventing the next bendy straw!  Think of the opportunity cost of that plus, the time and energy that us skeptics spend debunking and arguing and trying to portray the truth about these idiots and the bad information they spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, when we were up most of the night, watching late night TV and trying to get some rest, we both noticed that pseudoscience is alive and well.  Every other commercial was homeopathy, Kevin Trudeau or herbal supplements.   The assholes are alive and well. There’s much work to do. I take solace in the fact that the science and technology has progressed so much in spite of them. Maybe there’s hope for this war after all. If nothing else, we’ll probably live longer. &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237673507154"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1645773721107840134.post-2288720814576833559">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c6133e5ef7c5d38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The expert will speak...</title><published>2009-03-21T18:32:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T18:32:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://age-of-ignorance.blogspot.com/2009/03/expert-will-speak.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://age-of-ignorance.blogspot.com/" type="html">One of the mouthpieces over at AoA is David Kirby.

This is not about AoA, but, nonetheless, it expands on some ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was an event this week that annoyed me, and Sullivan at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1998"&gt;LeftBrain/RightBrain&lt;/a&gt; posted which triggers this response from me:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good post. However, it is not just a word, but an institutionalized attitude that needs to be addressed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people think that handicapped sports is merely “cute.” Far from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My son was the pen-ultimate torch bearer in the USA for the 2000 Sydney Paraolympics. Was there any media coverage? Heck no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One may ask when and where the Paraolympics are held? Most people do not know. The answer is simple, immediately following the Olympics on the same venue. Paraolympians have it easier, though. Smaller non-crowds, and those pesky cameras and media types just do not clutter up the landscape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every marathon in the US has three divisions, male, female and wheelchair. Do the winners of all three get invited to the Monday morning talk shows?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New York State sponsors The empire State Parks Games for the Physically Challenged at a world class facility (thank you Ted Turner for the now defunct Friendship Games). Come on down! No pesky media types to get in your way. Just 1500 athletes from around the region and Ireland competing. We used to have athletes come from Alabama, Boston, Philadelphia and other locales, but, the benign neglect under former governor George Pataki ended that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for Obama’s remark, it is merely an example of non-thinking. It is nothing new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW my son’s bowling average is higher than Obama’s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What annoyed me most is the fact that Obama was criticized by just those in the media who perpetuate ignoring the Special Athlete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hypocrites All.&lt;div&gt;

Here is a letter to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Science &lt;/span&gt;that I wrote a few years ago which was bounced.  It is in response to a piece called "Testing hypotheses: prediction or prejudice" by Peter Lipton (&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;307/5707/219"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Science &lt;/span&gt;307: 219-221&lt;/a&gt;; see replies by several others in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;308/5727/1409c"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Science &lt;/span&gt;308: 1409-1412&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Flaws of the fudge factor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lipton’s (1) analysis of common explanations for the intuitive notion that prediction is more convincing than accommodation is interesting and apt.  His own contribution to the discussion – namely that differences in the opportunity for “fudging” in support of a favoured hypothesis drive this disparity – is less compelling.  A few things to consider in this regard:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;1) Who can fudge? &lt;/span&gt; Lipton (1) argues that “fudging” is more problematic in accommodation than in prediction, but this appears to be based on the assumption that the predictions are made by one scientist and tested independently by another.  Certainly, this pertains to some fields of physics, but in a great many instances in the life sciences, the predictor and tester are one and the same.  Thus, there is ample opportunity for (unintentional) “fudging” of predictive tests in support of a preferred hypothesis at all stages, from experimental design to data collection to interpretation.  Moreover, one could make the argument that “tests” based on accommodation, which use data generated independently by many other authors and in which errors are random with respect to the hypothesis being tested, are more – not less – objective.  It also should be self-evident that if an author ignores contradictory data during an accommodation-based test, then other members of the scientific community are likely to expose this omission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;2) A question of scale.  &lt;/span&gt;If the comparison being made is in regard to a single datum, then indeed prediction may be far more convincing than accommodation.  However, if the scales differ, as they often do in real life, such that the prediction relates to a tractable and therefore simple test but the accommodation deals with multiple, independent types of information, then the latter may be considered much more convincing.  Therefore, it matters a great deal that prediction often tests one aspect of an issue whereas accommodation can include a much broader “consilience of inductions” (2).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;3) Prediction as confirmation.  &lt;/span&gt;The history of science is replete with examples in which predictive testing, while undoubtedly particularly convincing, has served mainly to confirm ideas that had been developed primarily on the basis of accommodation.  This has included some of the most revolutionary breakthroughs in science, including relativity, natural selection, atomic theory, and genetics (both Mendelian and molecular).  The question of which is the superior way to advance science is a false dichotomy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;4) An alternative hypothesis: x + y &amp;gt; x.&lt;/span&gt;   Perhaps the most important point overlooked by Lipton (1) is that hypotheses that are not compatible with existing data – i.e., which have not already achieved accommodation – are rejected before ever being tested by prediction.  In this sense, a more parsimonious explanation for the perception that prediction is more powerful than accommodation is that the former is a second-order test that only occurs after the first has been completed.  In other words, prediction seems more powerful because its very existence implies that a more fundamental criterion, accommodation, has already been met.  It is a mere truism that two tests will be more convincing than one, especially if the second test indicates inherently that the first has been passed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;References&lt;br&gt;1.

However, the equally great frustration of being a researcher is that our curiosity and passion invariably outstrip the resources available for our explorations.  It often feels like we spend the bulk of our creative energy begging for money, and when this is declined -- as it often is -- it can be crushing.  What keeps us going is the conviction that what we are doing, and what we have not yet found a way to do, is interesting and important and worth pursuing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The primary focus of my research is the evolution of genome size in animals.  Genome size is the amount of DNA in one copy of the chromosome set of a species, generally measured in terms of the number of base pairs (bp) or in mass (in picograms, or 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;g).  What makes this an intriguing topic of research is the enormous variability that exists across species: in animals, genome sizes range more than 7,000-fold.  Think about that for a moment. Some animals have &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;7,000 times&lt;/span&gt; more DNA in their cells than others.  Even within vertebrates, there is huge diversity at the genomic level: the largest (lungfish) is 350 times larger than the smallest (pufferfish).  Or consider amphibians, which range about 120-fold from the smallest in some frogs to the largest in a few aquatic salamanders. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The human genome contains about 3.2 billion base pairs.  In the simplest terms, one might expect this to be the largest genome of all -- humans are the most complicated organisms (right?) and that should require the most genes (right?) which in turn means more DNA (right?).  This was indeed the assumption when researchers began assessing genome sizes in the late 1940s -- before the structure of DNA was elucidated, and even before it had been established that DNA is the hereditary molecule.  At this time it was reported that the amount of DNA in a species' cells is mostly constant (thus, genome size is also called "C-value").  This itself was suggested to indicate that DNA, and not protein, serves as the molecular basis of inheritance.  However, it was also obvious by 1951 that the amount of DNA varies dramatically among species, and that the "complexity" of an animal and its genome size are decoupled.  There are, it was discovered, salamanders with 40x more DNA per genome than in humans.  This made no sense.  DNA amount is constant within species because it is what genes are made of, and yet more complicated organisms (which presumably require more genes) may have substantially less DNA in their genomes than simpler organisms.  This became known as the  "C-value paradox" in the early 1970s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was not long before the apparent "paradox" was resolved: most DNA in animal and plant genomes is not genes (it is "non-coding DNA").  This means that genome size need not be related to the number of protein-coding genes, and that there is no reason to expect more complex animals to have more DNA in their genomes.  However, this raised many new questions: What &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; this non-coding DNA?  Where does it come from?  How does it increase or decrease in amount in different genomes?  Does it have any effect on the organism?  Does it have any function?  Why do some species have so much of it and others so little?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite several decades of research, most of these questions remain at best only partially answered.  This is where my lab's research comes in.  We are interested in genome size diversity across all animals, in its effects on organism biology, and in the factors ranging in scale from individual DNA elements to ecological properties that accentuate or constrain amounts of DNA in the genomes of different species.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing that has become clear over the past several decades is that genome size is not randomly distributed across taxa.  Some, like birds, all seem to have relatively small genomes.  Others, like salamanders, all have large genomes.  The quantity of DNA also relates to  important features such as cell size and cell division rate, such that large genomes are found in cells that are big and divide slowly.  Because all animals are made of cells, this means that any feature relating to cell size or cell division rate could be indirectly related to genome size.  Body size is an obvious possibility, at least when cell numbers are held mostly constant.  Metabolic rate is another possibility, because the larger a cell gets, the lower its relative surface area is, and this can influence gas exchange.  Developmental rate is yet another, because slower individual cell divisions can add up to protracted development overall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have found that body size is correlated with genome size not only in some invertebrates like flatworms and copepod crustaceans, but also within specific groups of vertebrates like rodents, bats, and birds.  Inverse relationships between genome size and metabolic rate have been reported in both mammals and birds, and in particular it has been argued that flight imposes a  constraint on genome size due to its high metabolic demands.  This latter idea has been around for several years, but it has recently become the subject of renewed interest and some intriguing new discoveries.  For example, my colleague Chris Organ has used fossil cell size measurements to reveal that theropod dinosaurs (the lineage from which birds evolved) already had somewhat reduced genome sizes relative to other lineages before birds evolved, and that pterosaurs (the first vertebrates to evolve flight) also had small genomes.  One of my students has been working on flight in birds, and showed that wing parameters associated with flight ability are related to genome size as well.  We have also found recently that hummingbirds have the smallest genomes among birds (this isn't published yet, but we're writing the paper as we speak). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of development, we have found in insects like lady beetles and vinegar flies that  larger genomes are associated with slower overall development.  Similar correlations have been known for some time in amphibians.  What is more interesting is the pattern that we see with regard to metamorphosis, which represents a period of rapid and extreme physical reorganization.  Groups with intensive metamorphosis, like frogs living in deserts that complete their life cycle quickly during wet seasons, have very small genomes (smaller than birds).  Others, like aquatic salamanders that have lost the ability to metamorphose, have some of the largest genomes among animals.  This also seems to apply to the major lineages of insects.  Orders exhibiting complete metamorphosis ("holometabolous development") appear almost never to exceed about 2 billion base pairs, whereas some without complete metamorphosis ("hemimetabolous development") can be very large -- there are grasshoppers with 5x more DNA than in humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although genome size has been investigated for more than 60 years, some of these trends are only now coming to light.  One reason is that we are focusing on the "big picture" now.  Another reason is that we have technology that allows us to estimate genome sizes for large numbers of species.  To give one example, an undergraduate student and I produced new data for more than 300 species of moths last summer alone.  Previously, only 50 moth species had been analyzed (almost all of them in a pilot study I did a few years ago).  Of course, this is a miniscule fraction of the 180,000 or so described species in the order, but it's infinitely better than no information at all.  Various students of mine have begun filling other major gaps, including in mammals, birds, insects, worms, and molluscs, but a huge amount of work remains just to get a basic picture of genomic diversity and its significance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the upcoming series of posts, I will highlight some of the projects that I am very interested in undertaking, but which are on indefinite hold due to lack of funds.  (It's not that I haven't tried -- but granting agencies tend not to like this kind of large-scale "discovery" science as compared to the testing of very focused hypotheses).  There are several reasons why I think it is worth doing this.  First, most members of the public get only snippets of what goes on in research labs, most often provided by news reports.  The raw curiosity that drives basic research is not often conveyed, particularly when projects are first conceived (vs. once they're completed and published).  Second, this is the stuff that gets me out of bed in the morning, and I hope that others can share in the excitement that my students and I feel when we think about, and try to answer, these fundamental questions about the diversity of life.  Third, I believe it is useful for people to grasp the frustration that every scientist lives with when he or she feels that there are great ideas collecting dust for simple lack of funds.  Finally, it provides an opportunity to talk about some intriguing animal groups from a perspective that most people haven't considered.  In that sense, it should be an interesting exercise in thinking about the wondrous biological diversity that surrounds us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, you are welcome to explore the &lt;a href="http://www.genomesize.com/"&gt;Animal Genome Size Database&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of the tremendous diversity -- and glaring gaps  in our knowledge -- that drive my research program.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-406399869833832365?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/1SkBpozHV1Q" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237670520418"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/who_ya_gonna_call.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a53a8c576655500b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Who ya gonna call?</title><published>2009-03-21T20:45:04Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T20:45:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/dLtETqeyaQc/who_ya_gonna_call.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/who_ya_gonna_call.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Even here in relatively enlightened Minnesota, we have loony paranormalists. &lt;a href="http://ghostsofminnesota.blogspot.com/2009/03/report-from-battlefront.html"&gt;John of Ghosts of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; got to bring his skepticism along on one of those silly "ghost hunter" events in St Paul.

That’s very cool; Cosmos was groundbreaking and still stands today as perhaps the greatest science/astronomy TV documentary ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch the standard astronomy documentary these days, it’s all fast cuts and tons of information thrown at you, and in my opinion the average viewer walks away with nothing. Cosmos is slower paced, but fascinating, and Sagan took care to make everything fit in such a way that by the end all this stuff &lt;em&gt;makes sense&lt;/em&gt;. You have a more complete idea of how science works, and how all the puzzle pieces fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

It was clear that the speaker felt that online relationships were necessarily empty of any real depth or importance, and saw them as something entirely distinct from friendships formed and based in physical interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this puzzling, as I tend to see the internet as an extension of “real life” rather than an escape from it. Separating my friends into “irl” and “online” lists would be an impossible task, as probably 95% of my communication, with people I have known in person for many years as well as those I’ve never met in person, happens on the internet, and some of the people I’ve met online (and some I’ve never seen in the flesh) have become some of my closest friends.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see a distinction between your online and meat space friends?  Is there something inherent in internet communication that necessarily cheapens human interaction?&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237659546319"><id gr:original-id="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=328">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44737c6a8ed16581</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Human Rights"/><title type="html">And Now, A Word From Special Olympics</title><published>2009-03-21T18:18:08Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T18:18:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=328" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few sentences actually.&lt;/p&gt;

New Mexico was one of the states considering anti-evolution legislation based on the Discovery Institute’s “Model” bill (at the Institute’s &lt;a href="http://www.academicfreedompetition.com/freedom.php" rel="external "&gt; “Academic Freedom” site&lt;/a&gt;)  Like bills in &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/iowa-gives-the.html" rel=""&gt;Iowa&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere around the country,  this legislation has foundered, and literally died without being heard in committee during this year’s 60-day session which just ended ( noon on Saturday, March 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar legislation was put forth in New Mexico in 2007, but did not get out of committee.  (See this &lt;a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/02/2nd_creationism.html" rel="external "&gt;Panda’s Thumb report &lt;/a&gt; for the details).  That year, similar bills were carried by “Dub” Williams in the NM House, and Steve Komadina in the NM Senate.  After hearing from several scientists and teachers opposed to the bill at the 2007 hearings, Rep. Williams graciously tabled his version of the bill.  Sen. Komadina might have sponsored the bill again this year, but lost his 2008 re-election bid.  The local Intelligent Design/Creationist community found a new supporter in Sen. Kent Cravens, who introduced the bill, “USE OF SCIENCE IN TEACHING BIOLOGICAL ORIGINS,” on &lt;a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/_session.aspx?chamber=S&amp;amp;legtype=B&amp;amp;legno=%20433&amp;amp;year=09" rel="external "&gt;Feb. 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 2009&lt;/a&gt;.  With the session ending soon, Sen. Cravens apparently asked that it be heard by the Senate Education committee on Monday, March 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.  But, by the time the hearing was supposed to start, word came that it had been cancelled.
&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/20/sb433b.jpg" alt="sb433b.jpg" width="234" height="257" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To promote the bill, local anti-evolutionists abandoned the slick-looking “New Mexico Science Foundation” site used in 2007 (see &lt;a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2007/02/cheshire_cat_cr.html" rel="external "&gt;“Cheshire Cat” Creationism in New Mexico…”&lt;/a&gt;, and started a new site called &lt;a href="http://www.OriginsEducation.org" rel="external "&gt;“Origins Education” &lt;/a&gt;.
Were the New Mexico and Iowa bills based on the Discovery Institute’s model?  Of course.  Consider this similar phrasing in the DI, Iowa, and New Mexico versions of the legislation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; Students may be evaluated based upon their understanding of course materials, but no student in any public school or institution of higher education shall be penalized in any way because he or she may subscribe to a particular position on any views regarding biological or chemical evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iowa Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; “Students shall be evaluated based upon their understanding of course materials through standard testing procedures,” they “shall not be penalized for subscribing to a particular position or view regarding biological or chemical evolution.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Mexico Bill:&lt;/strong&gt; Public school teachers may hold students accountable for knowing and understanding material taught in accordance with adopted standards and curricula about biological evolution or chemical evolution, but they may not penalize a student in any way because that student subscribes to a particular position on biological evolution or chemical evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For a complete analysis of the entire bill by Kim Johnson, click &lt;a href="http://www.nmsr.org/analysis_09.pdf" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.nmsr.org/leg2009.htm" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)
Is the &lt;a href="http://www.academicfreedompetition.com/freedom.php" rel="external "&gt;Model Legislation&lt;/a&gt; the work of the Discovery Institute?  Of course - as a simple WHOIS inquiry will verify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although an amended version of the bill was never published, it appears that the sponsor planned to modify the bill to include language from a similar Louisiana bill, SB733, which was &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2008/06/louisiana-governor-signs-creationist-bill-001437" rel="external "&gt;adopted by that state’s legislature and signed by Gov. Bobby Jindal in June of 2008&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana bill declares that 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, upon request of a city, parish, or other local public school board, shall allow and assist teachers, principals, and other school administrators to create and foster an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that promotes critical thinking skills, logical analysis, and open and objective discussion of scientific theories being studied including, but not limited to, &lt;strong&gt;evolution, the origins of life, global warming, and human cloning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Santa Fe New Mexican &lt;a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/PrintStory/Bill-protects--controversial-science--teaching" rel="external "&gt;reported on March 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Sen. Cravens said the NM bill &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;just asks that if there’s a controversial scientific theory being presented, that a teacher can’t be reprimanded or fired or downgraded or any way harmed if the teacher happens to mention that there are other theories of controversial scientific nature, to include &lt;strong&gt;biological evolution, human cloning, global warming, you name a dozen different things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is human cloning included?  Unlike evolution or global warming, whose basic validity is claimed to be “controversial” by the religious right, the controversy of human cloning revolves on whether or not it should be attempted, not whether or not it is even possible.  As Prof. Barbara Forrest explained on the March 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; edition of NMSR’s &lt;a href="http://www.nmsr.org/podcast.htm" rel="external "&gt;Science Watch radio show&lt;/a&gt;, cloning and global warming are added because they, like evolution, are things despised by the religious right.  The reference to “human cloning” is just a surrogate for “stem cells,” according to Prof. Forrest.  Also, by adding more than just evolution and origin of life topics, the bill’s sponsor could claimed that he was not singling them out, should this show up in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Mexico Public Education Department (PED) published an &lt;a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/09%20Regular/LESCAnalysis/SB0433.pdf" rel="external "&gt;analysis of SB433&lt;/a&gt;, which the legislature cited on the bill’s &lt;a href="http://www.nmlegis.gov/lcs/legrpt/legsponsordis.aspx?SponsorCode=SCRAV&amp;amp;year=09" rel="external "&gt;status page&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PED analysis raises these points, among others: Although the bill’s definition of “scientific information” excludes information derived from religious or philosophical writings, beliefs or doctrines, SB 433 goes on to say that scientific information may have religious or philosophical implications and remain scientific in nature. The PED analysis states that this point would allow the teaching of theories of biological origins such as intelligent design or creationism. PED quotes the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, ‘There is no scientific controversy about the basic facts of evolution…arguments that attempt to confuse students by suggesting that there are fundamental weaknesses in the science of evolution are unwarranted based on the overwhelming evidence that supports the theory. Creationist ideas lie outside the realm of science, and introducing them in science courses has been ruled unconstitutional by the U. S. Supreme Court and other federal courts.” Pursuing this legal point, the PED analysis cites several court cases in which efforts “to impose a religious view of biological origins into the curriculum,” as SB 433 seems to do, have been found to violate the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution. This analysis also says that SB 433 implicates Article 2, Section 11 of the state constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion, and Section 22-13-15 NMSA 1978, which prohibits the teaching of sectarian doctrine in public schools. &lt;strong&gt;Finally, the PED analysis suggests that enacting SB 433 would invite litigation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, yet another Discovery Institute initiative has cratered.  This will only be a temporary setback for New Mexico’s creationists, who will no doubt turn up with more “academic freedom” initiatives at the New Mexico Roundhouse, school boards, city councils and the like.  Also, expect continued evolution of the language as is occurring in other legislatures.  There’s a &lt;a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/HB04224I.htm" rel="external "&gt;new bill in Texas&lt;/a&gt; in which anything scientific is fair game for substitution of superstition and the supernatural.  H.B. No. 4224 reads in part 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Students may be evaluated based upon their understanding of course materials, but no student in any public school or institution shall be penalized in any way because he or she subscribes to a particular position on scientific theories or hypotheses…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sound familiar?
It all may sound so reasonable, but the Discovery Institute’s “academic freedom” poison pills are deadly, as far as real science is concerned.
&lt;/p&gt;

Another misinformed excuse for not providing disability accommodations is that they are "special treatment" or somehow give a person a distinct advantage over others.  These excuses may be more prevalent for a person with an "invisible disability" such as a learning disability or autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/03/boston-u-student-with-learning.html"&gt;Boston U student with a learning disability explains that accommodations are not "special treatment"&lt;/a&gt; says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she said the most frustrating challenge for her is the general perception of students with learning disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People need to realize that one, we’re not dumb, and two, that students with learning disabilities don’t get special treatment,” Fleishaker, who was diagnosed [with dyslexia] in the 8th grade, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disability accommodations are intended not to give an advantage, but to "&lt;a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/level+the+playing+field"&gt;level the playing field&lt;/a&gt;."  If it takes a person twice as long to read and understand the questions on an exam, then they will not have the same amount of time as the other students to actually answer the questions.  Extra time on an exam does not give that student more time to answer the questions, it gives the student &lt;em&gt;the same amount of time&lt;/em&gt; as the other students to answer the questions.  This same idea extends into the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like anything, the misperception of accommodations as advantages particularly for people with learning or cognitive disabilities probably happens for a variety of reasons.  Invisible disabilities are difficult for people to understand as it is hard for anyone to imagine cognitive experiences that they themselves have never had.  The types of accommodations that help people with learning or cognitive disabilities are often ones that would give an advantage to a person who did not have a disability (unlike accommodations such as an ASL interpreter or first story building access which are unlikely to give an advantage to a person who does not need them).  Also, there is a mandate for all individuals to be held to the same academic or work place standards, and there is often fear on the part of instructors or employers that academic or work place standards would be compromised by the accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.com/2009/03/boston-u-student-with-learning.html"&gt;BU article&lt;/a&gt; also touches on something that has come up in the context of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/doj_restrictions_on_service_animals"&gt;ADA and service dogs&lt;/a&gt;: people abusing systems meant for accommodating disability in order to actually get special treatment or an advantage.  Is there proof that this truly happens with sufficient frequency to justify the level of fear it invokes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue is of concern because the more precautions that are taken to prevent systemic abuse, the more difficult it is likely to become for people who legitimately need accommodations to get them.  Especially for people who have difficulty with communication, organization, language, or social interaction, putting together accommodation eligibility materials may become an accessibility barrier in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237656914209"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/new_scientist_flips_the_bird_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa7ce7f0b5b788fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">New Scientist flips the bird at scientists, again</title><published>2009-03-21T17:10:07Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T17:10:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/2CHGY2hoCCw/new_scientist_flips_the_bird_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/new_scientist_flips_the_bird_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've been through this before. When &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/new_scientist_says_darwin_was.php"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt; ran their misleading "Darwin was wrong" cover&lt;/a&gt;, we hammered at them and pointed out that they were doing us no favors — they were giving ammunition to creationists who would never read the contents, but would wave that cover at school board meetings. And they did. We chastised the editor, Roger Highfield, and we had the impression that he was penitent, but it turns out we were completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt; is now using that same cover &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt; in their promotional material to flog magazines. Yes, that is their business, to sell magazines…but this represents a declaration that they think their market is the ignorant creationist segment of wanna-be pretend scientists. That&amp;#39;s a real shame.&lt;/p&gt;

Comment: "(The cat, he is quoting famous Russian comedian)"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIME Magazine's Claire Suddath &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1885270,00.html"&gt;commented on Яolcats last week&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it is funny (she's right) but that lolcats are not (she's wrong). Suddaths's (tongue-in-cheek?) complaint about lolcats is most relevant here on Language Log:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/"&gt;Lolcats&lt;/a&gt; is stupid. There, I said it. People who attribute grammatically incorrect statements to unsuspecting housecats are the same people who speak to children in baby voices and pat pregnant women's bellies without asking permission. Besides, even if your cat could speak, and it happened to ask for a cheeseburger, why would it spell "cheez" with a "Z?" Why? It's one thing to pretend that your cat can talk, but it's another thing to pretend that it has a debilitating &lt;a href="http://icanhascheezburger.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/funny-pictures-cat-suggests-a-larger-measuring-spoon.jpg"&gt;speech impediment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Suddath pronounces "cheese" in any way that sounds different from what "cheez" is meant to represent, then I hate to tell her, but she's the one with the speech impediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's look at the text of the lolcat example in her "speech impediment" link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dis iz da spoon u wil now uze to measure ma foodz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only noteworthy deviation from Standard English in terms of pronunciation here is &amp;quot;th&amp;quot; being represented with &amp;quot;d&amp;quot;. (I take the &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;da&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;ma&amp;quot; to simply represent schwa, which is not at all an atypical pronunciation of the vowel in these function words.) This is a very typical dialect variant, not a speech impediment. Of course, it&amp;#39;s also a prototypical child&amp;#39;s pronunciation of &amp;quot;th&amp;quot;, but not because they have a &amp;quot;speech impediment&amp;quot;. (Children are cute, hence the cat is cute — that&amp;#39;s supposed to be part of the appeal of lolcats, innit?) Yet another sad example of how the media grossly misrepresents linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;

To these little beasties, oxygen was a lethal poison, and when enough accumulated in the atmosphere, it killed off a lot of our planet’s nascent life. They couldn’t survive their own waste (and, as I point out in the book, take home whatever cautionary tale from that you like). The survivors were ones who could use this new molecule to their advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billions of years later, those survivors became us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; billions of years? Current thinking is that this event happened about 2.7 billion years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2009/03/16/2517425.htm"&gt;But new data seem to indicate&lt;/a&gt; that this event may have happened earlier than that. A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; earlier: like 3.5 billion years ago. This new data comes in the form of geological core samples containing hematite, a mineral that forms either through aerobic processes of bacteria (that is, biology using oxygen) or through photolysis (chemical changes from light) due to sunlight. But that latter happens only near the surface of water, and the hematite in the core samples seem to be from too deep in water to be from photolysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/bacteria_smoking.jpg" alt="Bacteria smoking"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The real reason all the good air went away.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new data are controversial, of course. It’s one thing to push back a date for an event like this, but another entirely to do so by 750 million years! A lot of current evidence points to free oxygen being produced 2.7 billion years ago. Clearly, either one or both of these measurements is wrong. Sometimes, when I hear a controversy like this, I wonder if they’re both in fact right: maybe there was free oxygen produced at the earlier date, and it went away for a time due to some mysterious event, and then came back 700 million years later as cyanobacteria rediscovered how wonderful oxygen is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just talking out of my hat there. Usually in science, when there are two contradictory sets of data, one turns out to be wrong. Misinterpreted or dated incorrectly. But not always. The fun part of this will be the arguing that goes on between scientists as they try to figure this one out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice for them: before arguing, take a deep breath. And whoever turns out to be right, remember just &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you can take that breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no way that, all those eons ago, those little bacteria could have known that their distant descendants would ponder their very existence. But life’s funny that way.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope none of our students &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/excerpt/2009/03/18/unlikely_disciple/"&gt;wasted their time fishing for souls for Jesus&lt;/a&gt;. Follow that link; it&amp;#39;s a story on Salon.com of a young man who goes undercover at Liberty University and goes on a Spring Break proselytizing trip to Florida. It&amp;#39;s depressing — mindless zealots on fire for the Lord wander the streets, asking people if they&amp;#39;ve found Jesus, and almost always getting turned down. Even the few who say &amp;quot;Hallelujah!&amp;quot; are unlikely to join the church. This is truly desperate angling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of post-salvation behavior is an interesting one. I thought, when Scott was teaching us to evangelize, that we'd be told to do some sort of follow-up with successful converts, if we had any -- guide them to a local church, maybe, or at least take their contact information. But there's no such procedure. If Jason had decided to get saved (he didn't), Martina would have led him through the Sinner's Prayer ("Jesus, I am a sinner, come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior" or some variant thereof), she would have let him know he was saved, perhaps given him some Bible verses to read, and they never would have seen each other again. Cold-turkey evangelism provides the shortest, most non-committal conversion offer of any Western religion -- which, I suspect, is part of the appeal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If the new believer backslides, though, like Jason was suggesting he might, Christians are likely to believe that he wasn't really saved. False conversions are a glaring wart on the face of Christian evangelism. In the book that accompanies our Way of the Master program, I found several sobering statistics about the percentage of apparent converts who stay involved with the church in the long term, including one from Peter Wagner, a seminary professor in California who estimated that only 3 to 16 percent of the converts at Christian crusades stay involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I received an account of a similar attempt at hooking a Pharyngula reader, EH.

Recently, &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jiahong/"&gt;Jiahong Yuan&lt;/a&gt; and I have begun working with a woman who aims to revise and improve tests that are used to certify court reporters. (For some background about the techniques and devices that the court reporters must learn to use, see &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001453.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001418.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  The (preliminary) results of our (pilot) experiment may be interesting to some of you; I think that they also point to a broader opportunity for linguistic research of other kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the questions that our partner needs to answer is what speaking rates, in words or syllables per minute, a court reporter is likely to encounter. Obviously, there's a great deal of variation, depending on the nature of the situation and the characteristics of the speaker. She doesn't want to make the tests too easy, by using material that's unusually slow or unusually simple, or by allowing too many errors at normal rates. Nor does she want to make the tests too hard, by using material that's atypically fast and complex, or by excessive penalties for errors at abnormally fast speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, she'd like to be able to make predictions, based on the test results, about the error rates that testees will  achieve across the range of situations they are likely to encounter in doing their job. In order to do that, she needs to be able to characterize what that range of situations really is. And an important dimension of characterization is speaking rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, overall speaking rate is easy to determine. You just count words in the transcript, measure time in the recording, and divide: result, words per minute. For syllables, you just look all the words up in a pronouncing dictionary, and add up the syllables, and divide by the same measure of elapsed time. (There are plenty of conceptual issues here about what a word is, exactly, and how many syllables to attribute to certain classes of sounds, and how to treat reduced pronunciations in rapid speech, and so on. But these are all essentially irrelevant to the topic under discussion, because the same metrics are used on the test materials as in the norms.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, overall speaking rate is not  the right measure. A deposition or hearing will have some periods of silence, and there will be other times when a speaker is speaking slowly, choosing words with great care. Those periods, where there are relatively few words per minute, will then be balanced by periods when the rate is faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For norming the tests, it&amp;#39;s important to know what the distribution of local rates actually is. A would-be court reporter may be able to keep up easily in transcribing speech at the overall rate or below, but may be completely lost when things get just a little faster — and it might be that (say) 40% of the material would then be beyond their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get some information about what the distribution of local speaking rates is really like, we plan to process a large and representative sample of real-life examples. To establish and validate the procedures, we began with an initial sample of 40-odd recordings with transcripts. The recordings were .wav files, made under normal conditions in the course of various depositions and court proceedings, and the transcripts were MS Word files, in the standard format for court documents of the relevant kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some preprocessing, we ran these through a system that aligns the words to the audio, using techniques from speech-recognition technology. (See &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jiahong/publications/asa08.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jiahong/publications/is2008_stress.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jiahong/publications/catcod_08.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for some additional discussion of this same set of programs.) Spot checks indicate that the alignment was very accurate, as we've come to expect after testing this system on many different kinds of material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the word-level alignment look something like this (the two numbers on each line are the starting and ending time of the corresponding word, in seconds counting from the start of the recording):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;404.443310658 404.553061224 "IT'S"&lt;br&gt;
404.553061224 404.722675737 "NOT"&lt;br&gt;
404.722675737 404.872335601 "YOUR"&lt;br&gt;
404.872335601 405.251473923 "JOB"&lt;br&gt;
405.251473923 405.371201814 "TO"&lt;br&gt;
405.371201814 405.560770975 "DIG"&lt;br&gt;
405.560770975 405.740362812 "INTO"&lt;br&gt;
405.740362812 405.929931973 "ALL"&lt;br&gt;
405.929931973 406.069614512 "THAT"&lt;br&gt;
406.069614512 406.448752834 "STUFF"&lt;br&gt;
406.448752834 406.57845805 "IS"&lt;br&gt;
406.57845805 406.638321995 "IT"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And internally, the aligner has also produced an alignment of the phonetic segments involved (as per the available dictionary pronunciations, anyhow), like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;404.443310658 404.47324263 &amp;quot;AH0″&lt;br&gt;
404.47324263 404.503174603 "T"&lt;br&gt;
404.503174603 404.553061224 "S"&lt;br&gt;
404.553061224 404.582993197 "N"&lt;br&gt;
404.582993197 404.692743764 &amp;quot;AA1″&lt;br&gt;
404.692743764 404.722675737 "T"&lt;br&gt;
404.722675737 404.802494331 "Y"&lt;br&gt;
404.802494331 404.842403628 &amp;quot;UH1″&lt;br&gt;
404.842403628 404.872335601 "R"&lt;br&gt;
404.872335601 405.031972789 "JH"&lt;br&gt;
405.031972789 405.22154195 &amp;quot;AA1″&lt;br&gt;
405.22154195 405.251473923 "B"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then wrote a script that scans these files and produces local speaking-rate estimates, over a moving 30-second window that scans from the start of the transcript to the end. Here's what the resulting time-function looks like, for one deposition selected at random:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Deposition1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Deposition1.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Click on the image for larger version. If you have a small screen, you might want to right-click and view the image in separate browser window.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example of the same sort:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Deposition2.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Deposition2.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second example, the average rate was 164 wpm, and the median 165. The maximum rate (in a 30-second window anywhere in this particular deposition) was 239; the 90th percentile was 200; the 95th percentile was 210.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of syllables rather than words, the mean rate was 226 per minute, the median 232, and the maximum 322. (The average ratio of syllables to words was 1.38, with a minimum (for any 30-second window) of 1.05 and a maximum of 1.82.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the (small) sample we&amp;#39;ve looked at so far — 41 transcribed passages amounting to around 10 hours in total —  the maximum over any 30-second window was 284 wpm. About 1.7% of the 30-second segments were faster than 225 wpm, and only around 0.25% were faster than 250 wpm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Wikipedia article on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_reporting"&gt;Court Reporting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The minimum speed needed to become certified by the NCRA is 225 words per minute. The NVRA requires a minimum speed of 250 words per minute to qualify for certification. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilled individuals can handle speeds well over 300 wpm. My understanding is that tested rates are adjusted downwards for errors, as in the case of typing tests.  The purpose of the work described here is to provide a better quantitive basis for predicting what such numbers mean in terms of coverage, and for deciding what the standards for certification should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many kinds of science. Some research is hypothesis-driven, where the goal is to confirm or refute a theory, or to determine which of two alternative theories is better. In other cases, the goal of the research is just to see what's out there, so to speak. Such mapping expeditions can be motivated by abstract curiosity, by relevance to theoretical questions, or by practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular piece of research is obviously a mapping expedition, motivated by a particular practical question, which was posed originally in a piece of email from a stranger. What I've described in this post is just the beginning of the project, not the end; but I'm now confident that the techniques we've developed for other applications will work on this material as well, and will enable us to give a useful answer to the practical problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the practical application is not of great interest outside the community of court reporters. But there's a broader context that's worth thinking about.  There are millions of hours of transcribed audio out there: court proceedings, oral histories,  broadcast interviews, political speeches, audiobooks, and so on.  The techniques used in this case, with some modifications and adaptations, can make this stuff available as raw material for research in all of the scientific disciplines that deal with spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 3/24/2009: Some interesting commentary &lt;a href="http://www.depoman.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1789"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, including this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I'm currently in a trial and during cross of the defendant today, the WPM meter never went below 250. It's hot, it's heavy. Can I get it? Absolutely. Do I stop the proceedings if I can't get it? Absolutely. But I try to hang on as best as I can, knowing they will eventually stop to look at an exhibit or take a breath at some point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hurdia victoria was originally described in 1912 as a crustacean-like animal. Now, researchers from Uppsala University and colleagues reveal it to be just one part of a complex and remarkable new animal that has an important story to tell about the origin of the largest group of living animals, the arthropods. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;People have always been fascinated by bats, but the scope of that interest generally is limited to how bats fly and their bizarre habit of sleeping upside down. Until now, no one had studied how bats arrive at their daytime perches. A Brown University-led research team is the first to document the landing approaches of three species of bats -- two that live in caves and one that roosts in trees. What they found was surprising: Not all bats land the same way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090313150250.htm" title=""&gt;Biodiversity Found In Unexpected Regions: More Than 200 Plant Species Found In Semi-arid Rivers In South Eastern Spain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The prevailing belief to date has been that the streams of south eastern Spain contained nothing of interest. However, a research project by the University of Murcia has shown that these ecosystems, which are unique in Europe, are home to great plant and animal biodiversity. This has enabled the research team to explode the myth that arid systems do not contain any organisms of interest, and to call for them to be protected because of their ecological value.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_630.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/FwbY10-Wbu4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237642419546"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-96088503557170302.post-7373163115930973211">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bf69d356ccd446e5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Prince Charles" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Duchy Originals" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="MHRA" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">MHRA force Duchy Originals to remove claims of efficacy</title><published>2009-03-21T13:08:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T13:39:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/03/mhra-force-duchy-originals-to-remove.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/7373163115930973211/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=96088503557170302&amp;postID=7373163115930973211" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.duchyoriginals.com/post.php/News/288"&gt;Duchy Originals&lt;/a&gt;, Royal Quackpot Prince Charles' company, has &lt;a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Howweregulate/Medicines/Advertisingofmedicines/Advertisinginvestigations/CON041381"&gt;been censured for putting claims on their website&lt;/a&gt; that their pretend-medicines work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency (MHRA) received a complaint regarding  &lt;a href="http://www.duchyoriginals.com/hypericum_tincture.php"&gt;Duchy Herbals Echina-Relief Tincture&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.duchyoriginals.com/hypericum_tincture.php"&gt;Duchy Herbals Hyperi-Lift Tincture&lt;/a&gt;, which had been advertised on the Duchy Originals website as having been assessed for efficacy.

Personally, I would use a word considerably stronger than 'misleading' - how about 'bullshit'? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two products had been registered with the MHRA as Traditional Herbal Medicines which means the MHRA do not assess evidence of efficacy. Although the report was only published this week, the action was agreed with Dodgy Originals back in January 09.

Part of the Duchy response from Andrew Baker included the following, with my comment below:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Our Duchy Herbals Echina-Relief Tincture and Duchy Herbals Hyperi-lift Tincture have both been approved and licensed as traditional herbal medicines by the UK regulatory authorities, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Come on, 'fess up, Mr Baker. You and I both know that MHRA approval does not give any indication as to effectiveness. The MHRA never make any claims as to a [Traditional Herbal Medicine's] efficacy, just that it is safe to use and has been well manufactured and won't kill you. But you wouldn't be trying to hide that fact, would you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the answer to that question is now obvious. It seems that Dodgy Originals had already been censured for claiming the MHRA registration demonstrated efficacy two months before writing the above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-7373163115930973211?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237640368911"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1987">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e027c2ff2a93154</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Autism, HBOT, and the new study by Rossignol et al.</title><published>2009-03-21T09:06:22Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T09:06:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/poOoGmXnX34/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Do'C</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237634940787"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/back_in_the_usual_autism_traffic_hbot_the_somali_autism_rate_the_case_of_sky_walker">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/426dda7d3fa5b3e2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Back in the Usual Autism Traffic: HBOT, the Somali "Autism Rate," the case of Sky Walker</title><published>2009-03-21T05:10:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T05:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/back_in_the_usual_autism_traffic_hbot_the_somali_autism_rate_the_case_of_sky_walker" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3371379573/" title="Chinatown traffic by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3424/3371379573_31fbb552e0_m.jpg" height="240" alt="" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I got back from Greece Friday afternoon, or, depending on how you look at it, Friday evening: Our plane landed a half-hour early into JFK at a remote-er area, so we "people" (as the pilot put it) were put onto a "people-mover" and transported to the terminal, after which we stood in an unusually long line to go through passport control, got our luggage, and then spent about an hour tracking down the bus company, bus driver (caught in rush hour traffic), and then the actual bus. There followed a (give or take) two-plus-hour bus ride through lower Manhattan, much of this spent not moving in bumper-to-bumper traffic in Chinatown. When we finally got to the Holland Tunnel, the bus driver got a ticket for cutting into traffic after a Lexus had cut into his lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my students and my &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;trip to Greece&lt;/a&gt;, which was simply glorious, ended, or rather fizzled out, on a less than edifying note---a bit of back-to-reality courtesy of rush hour New York/New Jersey traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't complain, though---that's how it is sometimes, or oftentimes, certainly in trying to get Charlie services: Every possible barrier and obstacle and mishap that seems possible becomes actual. Forms are lost, signatures needed, another eval is called for and, too often at the end of a long day of phone calls and emails, the answer is, "we can't fund that now." Or sometimes just what had seemed like an ordinary day doing ordinary things becomes an extra-challenging day with extra-challenging traffic, when some small change in routine proves triple-aggravating to Charlie, and a small expression of unhappiness grows into a major "episode" or "incident" of "behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be writing more about what we did in Greece, and how Charlie and Jim fared on the homefront. I read through many of the past week's news items about autism while standing in the passport control line and then on the (unmoving) bus: A &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE52J3RS20090320"&gt;study about hyperbaric oxygen therapy&lt;/a&gt;'s "efficacy"---the study is said to have found "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312205226.htm"&gt;significant clinical improvements&lt;/a&gt;" in its participants; three of its authors (Anju Usman, Jim Neubrander, Elizabeth Mumper), though, are familiar names in autism biomedical and &lt;a href="http://www.defeatautismnow.com/"&gt;Defeat Autism Now!&lt;/a&gt; circles. The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/health/17auti.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=health"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;' March 17th &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/health/17auti.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=health"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the purported "outbreak" of autism among Somali families in Minneapolis reviewed a story first noted &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/rates-of-autism-in-somali-children-in-minneapolis/"&gt;in July of 2008 in the autism blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/health/17auti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;ref=health"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; story did note that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somali refugees have many illnesses, said Dr. Osman M. Ahmed of the East Africa Health Project in St. Paul, including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, depression from the civil war, and vitamin D deficiencies.&lt;br&gt;
.....&lt;br&gt;
In Somalia, cousins do marry cousins. Globally, according to the March of Dimes, birth defect rates are highest in Arab countries with close intermarriage. But Somalia’s birth defect rate is moderate, and autism is not part of such studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about treatments like HBOT and concerns about causes such as whatever is behind an autism rate among Somali immigrants in Minneapolis: So often treatments and causes are at the top of the list of discussions, debates, dissension about autism. But another story from this week stood out to me, the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gbHkpAPpJH7lE5eYRr36vcazLCtAD9722GS80"&gt;plea of not guilty&lt;/a&gt; made yesterday by lawyers for &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_just_too_close"&gt;Sky Walker&lt;/a&gt;, who is charged with the murder of his mother, Trudy Steuernagel. As I've written, Walker's and Steuernagel's story has seemed the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_just_too_close"&gt;closest of all&lt;/a&gt; to me, as my own son has grown into a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;difficult adolescence&lt;/a&gt; and as I've been thinking more and more about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_prepared_criminal_justice_and_individuals_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;violence, criminal justice&lt;/a&gt;, and individuals with developmental disabilities. How to teach my own to respond and communicate in the most appropriate and effective ways, especially when he's in the midst of a panic/anxiety spell and his body reacts before he can reflect on what he's doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really worried that some unnameable difficult thing would happen in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/preparing_for_when_im_not_there"&gt;my absence&lt;/a&gt;, that I'd end up regretted I ever thought of going on a trip to Greece with my students and all this talk of the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_good_life"&gt;good life&lt;/a&gt; came to seem like so much pretty rose-colored musings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were the inevitable "moments" but these were quickly and compassionately addressed by Jim, my parents, Charlie's teacher and aides. While they were waiting for the rather beat-up bus, Jim and Charlie and my mom and dad went on a mini-walking-tour of Jersey City. As the bus huffed its way down Kennedy Boulevard to turn right on Montgomery, I spied a familiar light and dark blue parka'ed figure, elbows pointing outward and hands nestled over his ears and under two hoods.  "I see Charlie and Jim!" I yelled out and started waving wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the long road we've been walking on with Charlie, traffic jams are just another part of the experience. Stumbling, bumbling, we're just trying to get there and hear someone say, with a big smile, "Mom went to Greece! Mom went to Greece!"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237631546684"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_239.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/330f5792419956cb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-03-21T08:56:45Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T08:56:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/pJa63a7E454/clock_quotes_239.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_239.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It doesn't matter which side of the fence you get off on sometimes.

This doesn’t stop me from occasional blogging over at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt;, nor does it stop me from  doing some nighttime reading either.  In fact,  I’ve just finished reading &lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/9/21/abstract"&gt;Hyperbaric treatment for children with autism: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I think? It’s interesting, but I think it’s difficult to draw meaningful conclusions when methodology appears potentially flawed.  Dr. Steven Novella over at &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/"&gt;Neurologica&lt;/a&gt;, has already &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=496"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;written&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a little about this study (more specifically, about blinding), but I’ve added a little skepticism over at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt; for anyone who’s interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about science blogging, got some great questions from the students, and then went out for lunch - it was a lovely day here in the Triangle today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; There was another blogger there, stealthily! Dr.Isis was simultaneously gmail chatting with Sheril and Abel during class.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004976" title=""&gt;Phase Shifting Capacity of the Circadian Pacemaker Determined by the SCN Neuronal Network Organization&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In mammals, a major circadian pacemaker that drives daily rhythms is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), at the base of the hypothalamus. The SCN receive direct light input via the retino-hypothalamic tract. Light during the early night induces phase delays of circadian rhythms while during the late night it leads to phase advances. The effects of light on the circadian system are strongly dependent on the photoperiod to which animals are exposed. An explanation for this phenomenon is currently lacking. We recorded running wheel activity in C57 mice and observed large amplitude phase shifts in short photoperiods and small shifts in long photoperiods. We investigated whether these different light responses under short and long days are expressed within the SCN by electrophysiological recordings of electrical impulse frequency in SCN slices. Application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) induced sustained increments in electrical activity that were not significantly different in the slices from long and short photoperiods. These responses led to large phase shifts in slices from short days and small phase shifts in slices from long days. An analysis of neuronal subpopulation activity revealed that in short days the amplitude of the rhythm was larger than in long days. The data indicate that the photoperiodic dependent phase responses are intrinsic to the SCN. In contrast to earlier predictions from limit cycle theory, we observed large phase shifting responses in high amplitude rhythms in slices from short days, and small shifts in low amplitude rhythms in slices from long days. We conclude that the photoperiodic dependent phase responses are determined by the SCN and propose that synchronization among SCN neurons enhances the phase shifting capacity of the circadian system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004965" title=""&gt;A Specialized Odor Memory Buffer in Primary Olfactory Cortex&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The neural substrates of olfactory working memory are unknown. We addressed the questions of whether olfactory working memory involves a verbal representation of the odor, or a sensory image of the odor, or both, and the location of the neural substrates of these processes. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure activity in the brains of subjects who were remembering either nameable or unnameable odorants. We found a double dissociation whereby remembering nameable odorants was reflected in sustained activity in prefrontal language areas, and remembering unnameable odorants was reflected in sustained activity in primary olfactory cortex. These findings suggest a novel dedicated mechanism in primary olfactory cortex, where odor information is maintained in temporary storage to subserve ongoing tasks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004966" title=""&gt;A Fast Na+/Ca2+-Based Action Potential in a Marine Diatom&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Electrical impulses in animals play essential roles in co-ordinating an array of physiological functions including movement, secretion, environmental sensing and development. Underpinning many of these electrical signals is a fast Na+-based action potential that has been fully characterised only in cells associated with the neuromuscular systems of multicellular animals. Such rapid action potentials are thought to have evolved with the first metazoans, with cnidarians being the earliest representatives. The present study demonstrates that a unicellular protist, the marine diatom Odontella sinensis, can also generate a fast Na+/Ca2+ based action potential that has remarkably similar biophysical and pharmacological properties to invertebrates and vertebrate cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The kinetic, ionic and pharmacological properties of the rapid diatom action potential were examined using single electrode current and voltage clamp techniques. Overall, the characteristics of the fast diatom currents most closely resemble those of vertebrate and invertebrate muscle Na+/Ca2+ currents. This is the first demonstration of voltage-activated Na+ channels and the capacity to generate fast Na+-based action potentials in a unicellular photosynthetic organism. The biophysical and pharmacological characteristics together with the presence of a voltage activated Na+/Ca2+ channel homologue in the recently sequenced genome of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, provides direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that this rapid signalling mechanism arose in ancestral unicellular eukaryotes and has been retained in at least two phylogenetically distant lineages of eukaryotes; opisthokonts and the stramenopiles. The functional role of the fast animal-like action potential in diatoms remains to be elucidated but is likely involved in rapid environmental sensing of these widespread and successful marine protists.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004964" title=""&gt;Psychological Typhoon Eye in the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On May 12, 2008, an earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale jolted Wenchuan, China, leading to 69,227 deaths and 374,643 injured, with 17,923 listed as missing as of Sept. 25, 2008, and shook the whole nation. We assessed the devastating effects on people&amp;#39;s post-earthquake concern about safety and health. From June 4 to July 15, 2008, we surveyed a convenience sample of 2,262 adults on their post-earthquake concern about safety and health. Residents in non-devastated areas (Fujian and Hunan Provinces, and Beijing) and devastated areas (Sichuan and Gansu Provinces) responded to a questionnaire of 5 questions regarding safety measures, epidemic disease, medical workers, psychological workers, and medication. The ANOVAs showed a significant effect of residential devastation level on the estimated number of safety measures needed, the estimated probability of the outbreak of an epidemic, and the estimated number of medical and psychological workers needed (Ps&amp;lt;0.001). The post-earthquake concern decreased significantly as the level of residential devastation increased. Because of the similarity with the meteorological phenomenon of the eye of a typhoon, we dubbed these findings a &amp;quot;Psychological Typhoon Eye&amp;quot;: the closer to the center of the devastated areas, the less the concern about safety and health a resident felt. Contrary to common perception and ripple effect that the impact of an unfortunate event decays gradually as ripples spread outward from a center, a &amp;quot;Psychological Typhoon Eye&amp;quot; effect was observed where the post-earthquake concern was at its lowest level in the extremely devastated areas. The resultant findings may have implications for Chinese governmental strategies for putting &amp;quot;psychological comfort&amp;quot; into effect.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_139.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/oen5WIOhMSE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237613192443"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2592">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f6e9ac6e635be164</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><category term="Battlestar Galactica"/><title type="html">Battlestar Galactica comes to a frakkin’ end</title><published>2009-03-21T05:26:04Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T05:26:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/20/battlestar-galactica-comes-to-a-frakkin-end/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, one of the greatest science fiction television series ever has come to an end. And my opinion is that the ending was a bit of a mixed bag and a little disappointing. The back 10 episodes of season 4, or the final 10 episodes of  the series started off strong with [SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN&amp;#39;T BEEN WATCHING] the discovery of Earth and having it turn out to be nothing but the remains of a dead civilization nuked 2000 years ago and the failure of the prophecy. I do love a good failed prophecy story. My particular favorite bits were Laura burning her holy book and the words “Frak Earth” graffiti’d on a corridor wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after the initial shock revelations about Earth and the mutiny storyline, I think the show’s quality dropped significantly, focusing too much on the Cylon melodrama and not enough on the A-characters that we care most about. The Cylon backstory was too convoluted and nearly impossible to fully understand and Ellen should have been airlocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then we finally get to the final episode, which had a lot of great action (something we haven’t seen since the mutiny) and a whole bunch of threads being tied up. First, there’s the opera house, which I’m not really super happy where that led but it wasn’t terrible. Then there’s Hera’s role in all this, which felt not that important after all. The ultimate role of “All Along The Watchtower” was basically what I thought, so that was fine with me. Then the reveal to their new home I’m torn on. It kinda works and it was always one of the theories people talked about but I think the more you think about it, the more obvious plotholes are created. It seems to work best the less you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2364/2222600576_a0dc616d6c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2364/2222600576_a0dc616d6c.jpg" alt="" width="431" height="251"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the potentially religious stuff. How they tied up the Starbuck arch was not entirely unexpected but I really don’t like the religious overtones of it. I suppose you could argue that ever since she returned from the dead she’s been some sort of head character like Head 6 or Head Baltar, but that everyone could see. But she actually did interact with the physical world, shooting Gaeta’s leg, fighting in the mutany, fighting in the final battle at the Cylon base, etc. So that doesn’t really work. And you could go back to the original Battlestar series and argue that she’s one of the People of Light, but they don’t really offer that as a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then there’s the real final revelation:  Head 6 and Head Baltar are actual independent beings and more than mere projections in the heads of their real life counterparts and that curious business about Head 6 referring again to “God” and Baltar responding something like, “You know he doesn’t like being called that.” If this is to definitively define these characters as actual angels of “God” then that bothers me but I feel it’s ambiguous. I prefer to believe that they’re part of some ancient and advanced alien race that have been around for eons, like something you’d see in an episode of the original Star Trek, and that it’s just that these aliens have been guiding events all along as opposed to an actual magical god. Maybe I’m just deluding myself but as long as they’re aliens and not gods, I’m happy with the ending. So say we all.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, the press is abuzz with the news that a new study on maggot therapy had been released.(I've spared you the pictures).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237612263200"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/back_in_the_usual_autism_traffic">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ee3f17937669b4ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Back in the Usual Autism Traffic</title><published>2009-03-21T05:10:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T05:10:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/back_in_the_usual_autism_traffic" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3371379573/" title="Chinatown traffic by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3424/3371379573_31fbb552e0_m.jpg" height="240" alt="" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I got back from Greece Friday afternoon, or, depending on how you look at it, Friday evening: Our plane landed a half-hour early into JFK at a remote-er area, so we "people" (as the pilot put it) were put onto a "people-mover" and transported to the terminal, after which we stood in an unusually long line to go through passport control, got our luggage, and then spent about an hour tracking down the bus company, bus driver (caught in rush hour traffic), and then the actual bus. There followed a (give or take) two-plus-hour bus ride through lower Manhattan, much of this spent not moving in bumper-to-bumper traffic in Chinatown. When we finally got to the Holland Tunnel, the bus driver got a ticket for cutting into traffic after a Lexus had cut into his lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my students and my &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;trip to Greece&lt;/a&gt;, which was simply glorious, ended, or rather fizzled out, on a less than edifying note---a bit of back-to-reality courtesy of rush hour New York/New Jersey traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't complain, though---that's how it is sometimes, or oftentimes, certainly in trying to get Charlie services: Every possible barrier and obstacle and mishap that seems possible becomes actual. Forms are lost, signatures needed, another eval is called for and, too often at the end of a long day of phone calls and emails, the answer is, "we can't fund that now." Or sometimes just what had seemed like an ordinary day doing ordinary things becomes an extra-challenging day with extra-challenging traffic, when some small change in routine proves triple-aggravating to Charlie, and a small expression of unhappiness grows into a major "episode" or "incident" of "behaviors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be writing more about what we did in Greece, and how Charlie and Jim fared on the homefront. I read through many of the past week's news items about autism while standing in the passport control line and then on the (unmoving) bus: A &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE52J3RS20090320"&gt;study about hyperbaric oxygen therapy&lt;/a&gt;'s "efficacy"---the study is said to have found "&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312205226.htm"&gt;significant clinical improvements&lt;/a&gt;" in its participants; three of its authors (Anju Usman, Jim Neubrander, Elizabeth Mumper), though, are familiar names in autism biomedical and &lt;a href="http://www.defeatautismnow.com/"&gt;Defeat Autism Now!&lt;/a&gt; circles. The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/health/17auti.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=health"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;' March 17th &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/health/17auti.html?_r=1&amp;amp;ref=health"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the purported "outbreak" of autism among Somali families in Minneapolis reviewed a story first noted &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/rates-of-autism-in-somali-children-in-minneapolis/"&gt;in July of 2008 in the autism blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/health/17auti.html?pagewanted=2&amp;amp;_r=1&amp;amp;ref=health"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; story did note that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somali refugees have many illnesses, said Dr. Osman M. Ahmed of the East Africa Health Project in St. Paul, including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, depression from the civil war, and vitamin D deficiencies.&lt;br&gt;
.....&lt;br&gt;
In Somalia, cousins do marry cousins. Globally, according to the March of Dimes, birth defect rates are highest in Arab countries with close intermarriage. But Somalia’s birth defect rate is moderate, and autism is not part of such studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about treatments like HBOT and concerns about causes such as whatever is behind an autism rate among Somali immigrants in Minneapolis: So often treatments and causes are at the top of the list of discussions, debates, dissension about autism. But another story from this week stood out to me, the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gbHkpAPpJH7lE5eYRr36vcazLCtAD9722GS80"&gt;plea of not guilty&lt;/a&gt; made yesterday by lawyers for &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_just_too_close"&gt;Sky Walker&lt;/a&gt;, who is charged with the murder of his mother, Trudy Steuernagel. As I've written, Walker's and Steuernagel's story has seemed the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_just_too_close"&gt;closest of all&lt;/a&gt; to me, as my own son has grown into a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/advocacy_in_action_amp_adolescence"&gt;difficult adolescence&lt;/a&gt; and as I've been thinking more and more about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_prepared_criminal_justice_and_individuals_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;violence, criminal justice&lt;/a&gt;, and individuals with developmental disabilities. How to teach my own to respond and communicate in the most appropriate and effective ways, especially when he's in the midst of a panic/anxiety spell and his body reacts before he can reflect on what he's doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really worried that some unnameable difficult thing would happen in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/preparing_for_when_im_not_there"&gt;my absence&lt;/a&gt;, that I'd end up regretted I ever thought of going on a trip to Greece with my students and all this talk of the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_good_life"&gt;good life&lt;/a&gt; came to seem like so much pretty rose-colored musings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were the inevitable "moments" but these were quickly and compassionately addressed by Jim, my parents, Charlie's teacher and aides. While they were waiting for the rather beat-up bus, Jim and Charlie and my mom and dad went on a mini-walking-tour of Jersey City. As the bus huffed its way down Kennedy Boulevard to turn right on Montgomery, I spied a familiar light and dark blue parka'ed figure, elbows pointing outward and hands nestled over his ears and under two hoods.  "I see Charlie and Jim!" I yelled out and started waving wildly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the long road we've been walking on with Charlie, traffic jams are just another part of the experience. Stumbling, bumbling, we're just trying to get there and hear someone say, with a big smile, "Mom went to Greece! Mom went to Greece!"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237610728442"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2590">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7662b80ab251ecfe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education"/><category term="Intelligent Design/Creationism"/><category term="Institute for Creation Research"/><category term="Leo Berman"/><category term="Republicans"/><category term="Texas"/><title type="html">Forget school.

Yeah, take 1 guess what political party this anti-educational dipshit is from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/if_you_fail_an_iq_test_in_texa.php"&gt;PZ Myers illustrates the possible ramifications if this law passed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it were to pass, though, I’d like to move to Texas for a few months, open a free daycare, and issue doctoral degrees to every toddler who can go a day without pooping his pants. I’d have the diplomas printed on diapers, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s about what a degree from a Texas university would be worth if Berman had his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite frankly though, I don’t see why one needs a whole educational institute devoted to creationism. The final exam only has one question; it’s just an image of a guy shrugging his shoulders. And the correct answer is “God dunnit” though “And then a miracle occurred” is also an acceptable answer.&lt;/p&gt;

While I still don’t see them as “the next Google” as everyone loves to call them, I admire their boldness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this article about Google’s Visual Design lead, who is moving on to Twitter, and the ensuing conversation about it over on Hacker News, made me realize how fearful many successful businesses are of shaking things up. One commenter on HN said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started at Google Nov. ‘06 Doug had created some awesome Gmail mockups that really took the design and functionality above and beyond and — having heard about how ground up Goog worked — I was thinking those designs would be acted upon and built in the coming months and I was excited about using that Gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I left end of last year, the mockups were still being iterated on, and the only thing that had been built based on those mockups were the buttons. Gmail’s just too big, as are search and ads, and UX is too disorganized and outnumbered to have any say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people fall into this trap. I know I have. When you have a lot of customers (and we’ve got a fraction of a percent of the number Facebook does) you realize quickly that any change you make is going to be met with a lot of complaints, and the bigger the change, the more vocal they’ll be. It creates a serious form inertia and scares you into leaving well enough alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is the conflict between what a business would define as an improvement and what its customers would. While all business share the same scoreboard, money, customers don’t really care about that. They want a site that fits certain needs, and once they find one, changes are often unwelcome. Changes that give your site a broader appeal often make it less appealing to the early adopters. Even if they will come to like it in time, their aversion to change in a service they already love can often cause a near-term firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given all that, I think relative to a lot of other companies, Facebook has been pretty ballsy. Not just in their famously spurning large acquisition offers, but also in their willingness to push improvements that they feel will benefit them in the long run but that cause them a lot of grief in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any form of gambling, sometimes one doesn’t work out. Beacon was a pretty spectacular example of that. I’m still not sure how they thought that one would work. My 11 year old cousin would have realized that idea was idiotic. But they at least dealt with that well and it’s now largely forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while there have been a few misfires, there’ve been a few successes as well. When they introduced the mini-feed and some other forms of public information, lots of current customers were pissed and there was a very big backlash. They liked the site how it was just fine, and we’re a little nervous about the changes. But Facebook did a pretty good job of allowing people to set privacy settings, and of configuring the default ones, and then of explaining it to customers (something they should have done right off the bat) and in time people grew to love it. Now that sort of stuff is now what people visit the site for, it’s the prime reason for the tremendous engagement they see. Without those features they’d be just another Myspace wannabe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new home page (and the new Facebook in general) are examples of big gambles too, and while the smoke hasn’t entirely cleared yet, I think they’re going to be long-term successes. While as an app developer I absolutely despise the new home page (which removes them from the right side, and seems to have caused an overall traffic dip for games on the platform) and the new Facebook (which has had an even more deleterious effect on apps in general) as a Facebook user I vastly prefer both. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether or not they work out in the end, I’m impressed that they even tried it. It’s hard making bold changes to an application that has 150 million users and is gaining hundreds of thousands of new ones each day. It’s hard to not roll it back immediately when the complaints start flooding in. But in the long run, it’s that sort of gamble that separates the Facebooks from the Orkuts. It’s easy for a new service like Gmail to boldly go where no web-based email has gone before, it’s hard for the Gmail that’s been around for 5 years and is the third or fourth largest service (and possibly the fastest growing) to make sweeping changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have to say that on the whole, I’m inspired by it. It’s something I think we need to do more of at Blue Frog Gaming. We often find ourselves, when evaluating a change, saying things like “we’re going to get flooded with complaints over that one” or “the customers who bought hundreds of dollars worth of commissioner points are going to be pissed”.  But we can’t let that stop us from improving. We have to do what is best for our games in the long term, and if that means some unhappy customers in the short run, well, that’s what economists call creative destruction. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237600981476"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/20/saucer-fleet-we-have-a-winner/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b5d3d3eee611e69</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><title type="html">Saucer Fleet: We have a winner!</title><published>2009-03-21T01:51:33Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T01:51:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/20/saucer-fleet-we-have-a-winner/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have a winner in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/17/new-bablog-contest-win-the-saucer-fleet/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Saucer Fleet &lt;/em&gt;giveaway&lt;/a&gt;!

I think I&amp;#39;m flattered. I suspect I annoyed some fan of Ken Ham.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/banned_in_kentucky.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/OCGSQedFpIE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237598810854"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2009/03/venal-misleading-pathetic-dangerous-stupid-and-now-busted/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/efe77db9489c9cf6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bad science"/><title type="html">Venal, misleading, pathetic, dangerous, stupid, and busted</title><published>2009-03-21T01:20:04Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T01:20:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/03/venal-misleading-pathetic-dangerous-stupid-and-now-busted/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscience.net/" type="html">Ben Goldacre   The Guardian    Saturday 21 March 2009

If certain legislators in New Jersey have their way, you’ll be keeping that memory not-so-neatly tucked away in your thong - provided there’s any room - if their proposed ban on Brazilian waxing passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year it seems that there were a couple of Jersey ladies who had issues getting their bald on. They complained, one even filed a lawsuit, and the great state of New Jersey’s … um… &lt;em&gt;ears&lt;/em&gt; perked up. They were ready to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, tell us in detail what happened during your waxing session. Wait. Start with what you were wearing… yes, yes it’s very relevant! We need these details for the official record… slow down, what did your waxxer look like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to take the complaints lightly, both women were hospitalized because of their injuries, but is a state-wide ban on uhoh-waxing really necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: The wax at your salon is not necessarily sterile. It’s not necessarily new. And it’s not necessarily free of little pieces of the last client’s (or the one before hers or the previous day’s clients’) vajayjay skin… but that’s also true for lip skin, armpit skin, leg skin and toe skin (from the hobbits going undercover).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: The vagina and anus have more bacteria living around them than other waxable parts. That wooden stick smears that bacteria all over your body like frosting on a hairy cupcake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: There is a real risk when going to a salon that you could come out with someone else’s bacteria partying in your vacated follicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: Sterilizing wax in between uses is generally impractical. It has to be heated to at least 220ºF (104.4ºC) for &lt;a href="http://www.healthcentral.com/sexual-health/askthegyno-256719-5_3.html"&gt;15-20 minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/519425"&gt;Infections do happen&lt;/a&gt;. And, like in cases like the two women in New Jersey, they can lead to hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, there are some real concerns involved in waxing. And new Jersey’s response is that women should either buy bigger bikini bottoms and embrace the abandoned wild ‘dos of the 1970’s or DIY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, DIY doesn’t seem so bad (some websites have dedicated considerable time and space to those willing to pay $19.95 a month to “appreciate” the fine-art of DIY hair removal.) In fact, most of us rely on ourselves for hair removal. There are plenty of benefits to DIY over hiring someone to do it - it’s cheap, no appointment necessary and there’s no wondering what your hair removal expert is thinking about that curiously placed Max Hedroom tattoo you were so proud of back in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also raises new issues when its time to trim - or remove - the hedges.  Realistically, you have two options for your there-hair - you can shave or you can wax. &lt;strong&gt;Do not ever use hair removal cream on your nethers!&lt;/strong&gt; Most of them are barely gentle enough to use on your skin at all without risk of burns, much less the most sensitive areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-waxing can be messy and tricky at best. While waxing at home frees you from the issues of other people’s coochie cooties, you still run the risk of spreading your own cooties to parts of your body they don’t belong… it’s like wiping back to front, but then smearing the tissue all over your irritated skin that’s covered with open micro-wounds. While you’re not going to get someone else’s infection, you’re still not using a sterile product. You’re probably not sanitizing your bathroom before waxing either, so you’re opening yourself up to other contaminants that you woudln’t find in a salon. Is it better or worse than a salon? Probably neither, but at least at the salon you don’t have to rip your locks of love out of place yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaving is generally safe for most hair-removal purposes. It’s cheap. It’s easy. It’s fast. Unfortunately, it’s very short term, lasting only hours for some people. But the reality is that shaving can be risky, too. Anything that involves unsanitized cutting utensils pressed up against unsanitized skin should be categorized as “proceed with caution”. Add a bunch of folds and crevices while removing the ability to navigate visually… and suddenly “bumpin’ uglies” is crossing the line from euphemistic to literal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2007/06/post_41.php"&gt;Women are still going to&lt;/a&gt; remove their funfuzz, no matter what the lawmakers say. Salons are still going to offer it off the menu if it’s criminalized. Women are still going to be hospitalized with nasty infections. Ideally, we’d see salon owners working on making their salons more sanitary, or perhaps we’d see laws requiring more education in the licensing process. Maybe instead of banning the procedure all together, NJ could try some stricter regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be educating people about what happens and what risks are involved with hair removal, and maybe even try to send the message that body hair isn’t a flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no ultimately safe way to remove your downtherehair. If you like it gone, get it gone, but do it as safely as possible. Here are things you can do to reduce your risk of infection:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are diabetic, don’t get waxed. Diabetics are at increased risk of infection from waxing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before y0ur waxing session starts, ask for fresh wax. If they won’t oblige, leave. A good salon will do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your esthetician does all your other waxing before going on to the “bikini” part of your session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have the area around your anus waxed last, and area around your vagina done second from last.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get over the stigma, go with the ‘fro!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Thanks 100% to this post*, NJ has decided that the ban is ridiculous and is &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-brazilian-wax-ban-react,0,4403680.story"&gt;no longer pursuing a law against waxing-off.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once the economy is in better shape, have a program set up where individuals/companies can sponsor a specific science lab.  Someone could put together a list of labs and what they do, and if anything sparks the interest of a sponsor, he or she could fund it.  I don't think people are aware just how little money many labs in Canada receive, and therefore just how much of a difference some outside assistance could make.  The average starting grant from NSERC in many panels is $25K-$30K per year.  So, the number of students that a lab can support and the amount of work they can do could pretty much be doubled for the change in your average corporate couch.  Basic science does not have to be totally dependent on grants -- maybe it's time to become more creative.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-5187170110703069486?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/prFzR5GU8M4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237596129840"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/friday_recipe_chinese-style_ro.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7354598201cdc6e7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Recipes"/><title type="html">Friday Recipe: Chinese-Style Roasted Beef Shortribs</title><published>2009-03-21T01:20:15Z</published><updated>2009-03-21T01:20:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/G3_P2kXWU1E/friday_recipe_chinese-style_ro.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/friday_recipe_chinese-style_ro.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; It's been a while since I posted a recipe, and last week, I came up
with a real winner, so I thought I'd share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I absolutely love beef short ribs. They're one of the nicest cuts
of beef - they've got lots of meat, but they're well marbled with fat, and they're up against the bone, which gives them extra flavor. When cooked well, they've got an amazing flavor and a wonderful texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/260px-Shacha_sauce.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This recipe produces the best short ribs I've ever had. It's based,
loosely, on a chinese recipe, but it's cooked more in a western style.
There's one unusual ingredient, which is a chinese sauce that I've mentioned before on the blog, called sha cha sauce. It's made from brill shrimp,
garlic, and chili peppers. You can get it in a chinese grocery store. The english label is, unfortunately, "barbeque sauce", but you can identify it
by the ingredients, and by the picture of the jar over to the side.&lt;/p&gt;

xia cha. 

&lt;h3&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 4 lbs shortribs, bone in, cut flanken style. (That means
    cut perpendicular to the bone, in chunks about 2 inches long.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; One large onion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 4 cloves garlic. (more if you really like garlic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1 cup soy sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1 cup beef stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 1 cup dry gin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; 4 tablespoons sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; One teaspoon xia cha sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Put the garlic and onion into a food processor, and
run it until they're nicely chopped. Then add the liquids to
the processor, and run it until the garlic and onions are a puree
mixed into the liquids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Put the short ribs into an oven-safe deep dish, and cover them with
the liquid. Put this into the fridge for a few hours to marinate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Heat the oven to 350, and put the marinated shortribs into the
oven - marinade and all. Cook for 3 hours, taking it out and basting it every 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; By now, you've got some very well-cooked shortribs, sitting in the marinade, along with a huge amount of fat that cooked out of them. Take them out of the liquid, and set them aside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Strain the liquid, and skim the fat. What's left is a very strong, but very flavorful sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Put the shortribs back into the now empty pan. Give them a light baste
with the sauce. Heat the oven up to broil, and when it's hot, put the
 short ribs back in, just long enough to brown and crisp the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And they're ready to eat. Serve it with the sauce on the side, along
with rice and some stir-fried vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

Farley, has produced some interesting results about quality of life and autistic development.  The aims of the study were (quote from &lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/122267217/abstract"&gt;the study itself&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our aims were to (1) define current function and service needs; (2) explore the feasibility of studying a larger statewide sample; and (3) examine relations among historical and current variables not reported in other recent outcome studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Historical and current variables" meant things measured for the participants as children and adults, for example IQ and adaptive skills including daily living, social, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that current daily living skills (including with support) were stronger predictor of outcome than childhood IQ, verbal ability, or other variables measured in childhood or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also speculated that the &lt;a href="http://bulletin.aarp.org/states/hi/2009/11/articles/study_half_utah_adults_autism_lead_fulfilling.html"&gt;strong community-centered culture of Utah&lt;/a&gt; might have played a role in why this group had better outcomes than autistic adults who participated in other similar studies. Again, from the original study ("the participant" is the autistic person participating in the study),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible factor is the support of the LDS communities in which many participants grew up and continue to live. The church building that members attend is determined by their address; thus, children go to school, attend church activities, and reside in a neighborhood as a cohort. Inclusion of individuals with disabilities is a strong LDS cultural value. Parents attend services and activities with their neighbors, sharing joys and concerns about their families. Families are often large, and in many cases a sibling’s social circle extended to include the participant. Some participants had assistance finding work through these networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the lead researcher (&lt;a href="http://www.unews.utah.edu/p/?r=031809-3"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an amazing group of people who, in many cases, did a lot more than their parents were told they would ever do," Farley said of those who participated in the follow-up study. "This gives a lot of hope for younger people with autism and average-range IQs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Outcome" in this study was defined mostly by employment, number and quality of social relationships, and residential situation.  There has been some criticism of the use of these types of items as outcome measures, as they assume that all people value these things in their lives, or that these items correlate somehow to overall well-being, but that's perhaps a topic best left for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on topic to this post is what the University of Utah site says about the usefulness of studies such as these  (&lt;a href="http://www.unews.utah.edu/p/?r=031809-3"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term follow-up also will help researchers identify issues that affect the social outcomes of adults who were diagnosed with autism as children, providing information that can help determine services that will help these adults lead more fulfilling lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237589450172"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_five.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc7dfad8ab5ab73d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Administrative"/><title type="html">Survivor: Pharyngula!

Several of our unwilling contestants took a shot at the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_four.php"&gt;immunity challenge&lt;/a&gt;, to comical effect: they either completely failed to be aware of what people find irritating in their posting habits, or in one case, even &lt;i&gt;plagiarized&lt;/i&gt; his answer. The result of the vote by the readership: none met the challenge, although several thought Facilis made a good effort, so no one has immunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php"&gt;vote to see who would be banned&lt;/a&gt;? Once again, John Kwok saw an ember of a possibility that he might be selected, and chose to fight it by repeatedly throwing buckets of gasoline on it. If he&amp;#39;d just ignored it, I&amp;#39;m sure he would have been passed over without a problem… but by constantly fanning the flames, he kept a constant volley of votes for him going, and finally ended up in second place. Good work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final winner, though, and the one who is now banned, is the loathsome &lt;b&gt;Simon&lt;/b&gt;. His foul-tempered hatefulness was an unstoppable force, and the silliness of a Kwok could not match it. Simon is gone, and good riddance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I had planned on doing one more round of voting to clear the blog of a total of three trouble-making pests, but in the end I've decided to cut it short right here. Something happened that compels me to simply ban one more person outright, and end the whole series. It seems that one of our contestants has been writing to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/"&gt;a friend&lt;/a&gt; and asking him to use his powers of persuasion to compel me to a) &lt;i&gt;LEAVE KEN MILLER ALONE!!!&lt;/i&gt; (should be read with a Chris Crocker-esque shriek, and with much running mascara) and b) grant the correspondent immediate, automatic immunity. He also threatened to complete his novel and include me as a character, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ed-hamilton/crichton-vs-crowley-din_b_36785.html"&gt;ala Michael Crichton&lt;/a&gt;. Can you guess who it was?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somebody is taking this far too seriously, and I think it's time to cut off his little obsession. Goodbye, &lt;b&gt;John Kwok&lt;/b&gt;. You won't be commenting here any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we're done, for now. Those who survived &lt;i&gt;Survivor: Pharyngula!&lt;/i&gt; should not rest easy, though — I will use my vast powers capriciously, and with malice, if you should persist in your ways that got you on the list in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the victims has responded in email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey PZ -
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since Rick Moody lampooned a certain former "New York Times" book reviewer who had dubbed Rick, "the worst writer of my generation", in his novel "The Diviners", it looks like you're going to be honored twice. I already have an IRA terrorist whose persona is quite similar to yours (I told Greg that this was an accident.). Assuming that I sell this novel and write another, I'll be certain you'll appear in that one too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
BTW, Rick has since "kissed and made up" with the object of his affection. I haven't asked him about it, only because I know he's not one to talk about it (I'll let you guess how I know Rick. Hint: Look at my Facebook page.).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm giving you a chance to change your mind. I think you ought to reconsider ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, dog. He knows Rick Moody! And he's going to pretend a fictional IRA terrorist (who is "a sadistic terrorist and murderer") is me! But you know, I don't think I'll reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gets better! A new threat from the Kwok:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PZ, what comes around, goes around. Am looking forward to giving you the just dessert that you so richly deserve. And if you don't behave with the Muslims, I might do a "Pontius Pilate" act and give my cousin Jim and his CAIR buddies carte blanche to deal with you as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_five.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/8dJM1HZtv4g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237587209574"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-7791581759067733344">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/192cc8458550e43f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Private foundations could save Canadian science.</title><published>2009-03-20T21:51:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T22:04:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/7nZDJgWy50A/private-foundations-could-save-canadian.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=7791581759067733344" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/private-foundations-could-save-canadian.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Having spent time at a large museum in the US, I am familiar with the common occurrence of privately endowed "[generous person or foundation] lab of [awesome research]" initiatives.  The culture of funding basic research is not as well developed in Canada as it is in the US, so these are much less commonly found up here, at least in terms of support for specific researchers working on basic science.   Given the extreme challenges facing scientists in this nation, especially those who are working on basic research (vs. technology, health, environment, etc.), this could be an area where private funding could really help.  Obviously, this would be contingent on foundations with an interest in basic science, but it's something that seems to me increasingly needed as grants shrink, frustration builds, and brains drain.  Funding agencies tend to shy away from high-risk (what we would call interesting and novel) projects, and are focusing more and more on projects that have commercial potential or some other applied use.  It is very rare to be able to explore without being strongly constrained in some way.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-7791581759067733344?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/7nZDJgWy50A" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237586006041"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/friday_cephalopod_hatchling.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/47119ecb45170c4e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Hatchling</title><published>2009-03-20T22:20:14Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T22:20:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/i5MkkvpPoas/friday_cephalopod_hatchling.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/friday_cephalopod_hatchling.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/03/euprymna.jpg" width="425" height="627" alt="euprymna.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Euprymna tasmanica&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Today, I’d like to talk about patriotism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is patriotism logical? Does it make sense to have strong support and pride in a country simply because you were born (or have a passport from) there? And, since patriotism is often the harbinger of more dangerous ‘-isms’ like nationalism and even jingoism, should we, as skeptics, encourage patriotism?

&lt;p&gt;20 years ago this month, on March 13th 1989, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee was working at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN). He gave a &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; (”Information Management: A Proposal”) to his boss, Mike Sendall, who described the idea as “vague but exciting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vaguely exciting idea described the creation nodes of computers containing hypertext pages that you could view with browsers on a network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this was the birth of a little something called the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:410px"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/www2.jpg" alt="Sir Time Berners-Lee back in the day" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;p&gt;---Sir Tim Berners-Lee back in the day---&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shouldn’t this formal proposal be considered the conception of the web?  I would think the birth happened a couple of years later when it debuted on the internet ready to go.  Anywho…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is partly responsible for birthing the web. Scientists at CERN were already planning for this collider back then and many meetings would end with the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, but how will we ever keep track of such a large project?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what prompted Berners-Lee to write the proposal. In it he wrote that this paper…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“discusses the problems of loss of information about complex evolving systems and derives a solution based on a distributed hypertext system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He presciently realized that this proposed tool for CERN would soon be needed by the world at large:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CERN is a model in miniature of the rest of world in a few years time. CERN meets now some problems which the rest of the world will have to face soon”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didn’t invent hypertext though. This is a document that contains hyperlinks to other information that could be immediately followed. This concept had been around since the 1960s and was even being implemented on small scales in various applications. Of course, all these previous implementations were completely overshadowed by the web and its incredible proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee may not have thought up hypertext but he did create fundamental aspects of the web that survive to this day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP: Those four letters that precede every website address. It stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and is the primary protocol for websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;URL or URI: Uniform Resource Locator (Indicator). This is the full address that every website needs like www.theness.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTML: This is the Hypertext Markup Language that billions of webpages to this day still use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet itself was around for more than 15 years before the Web arrived. At that time, the public saw it (if they considered it at all) as merely corporate email or the domain of nerds. Those who did use the internet were likely related to our defense department or pursuing academic goals. Communication was purely text-based but there was lots of information and resources available back then if you could only find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was it wasn’t browsable. You had to seriously want to get to information and know exactly what you were looking for. To get to information you had to know protocols like ftp and telnet. If you had the gall not to know the exact address you wanted you needed to use tools like gophers, archies, and veronicas to find the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember trying to get online at this time. I had read a lot about the internet and tried to get on at a local college and with little guidance I failed utterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web changed all that by making it simple to find information. The telnet and ftp functions became invisible to users requiring little more than mouse clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogImages/www1.jpg" alt="" width="708" height="293"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love reviews and predictions about game-changing technology that are so far off that it should be criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 1994, Time magazine &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; why the Internet would never go mainstream:&lt;br&gt;
“It was not designed for doing commerce, and it does not gracefully accommodate new arrivals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsweek described the situation in 3 words in a February 1995 headline: “THE INTERNET? BAH!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, hindsight is 20-10 and no one in the early 90’s predicted the full extent of the Web’s impact on communication, publishing, shopping, business practices, and don’t forget porn. I think even today we’d be surprised if we could see the web in 20 or 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the future of the web?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One change that’s slowly happening now is the transition from IPv4 to IPv6. This is the Internet Layer protocol that manages how data packets are handled on the internet. Among many other improvements, this will primarily allow for an vastly increased number of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv4#Address_space_exhaustion"&gt;potential addresses&lt;/a&gt;. This could come in handy if IPv4 runs out of addresses in a few years as some predict.  “Vastly increased number” is actually an understatement. V6 could offer a staggering 2 to the 95 power addresses for every person on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think getting the web on all cell phones is another near-term change that’s inevitable.Berners-Lee has said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting the web onto phones is very important, as there are many more browsers on phones than laptops, and in developing societies it’s really exciting as that’s the only way people use the web”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There maybe more than a billion people online now and that’s cool but that means there are many billions that aren’t. Ubiquitous web-phones could vastly increase the already sizable penetration of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berners-Lee himself thinks the future of the web is all semantic.&lt;br&gt;
He’s been pushing for the semantic web for years now and it does seem promising. The idea here is that websites would be coded in such a way that programs could be used to extract meaning from them instead of people doing it. This would in essence make the web machine-readable removing much of the mind-numbing work people do now to find information, share it, or combine it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the early days of the web, this could morph into something far beyond our current ability to prognosticate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the web be like for our kids or grandkids?  I imagine the web embedded in everything man made. Everything could have a web address. The web would likely be embedded in people as well. Our connection to the web will be no farther away than spoken words or even gestures.  Never mind sitting down and googling something. Just ponder a question during a conversation and helpful information will appear on your digital contact lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ll call this googleplexing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237583463169"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/friday_random_10_320.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/df2e178cc24202ca</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Music"/><title type="html">Friday Random 10, 3/20</title><published>2009-03-20T21:56:04Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T21:56:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/hiYoImPOp8Q/friday_random_10_320.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/friday_random_10_320.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valley of the Giants, "Back to God's Country"&lt;/b&gt;: I mentioned Valley of the Giants a few weeks ago, as one of my favorite post-rock bands. A few weeks of listening to them incessantly hasn't changed that. They're absolutely brilliant. This track is very typical
of them; it's got a slow start, with an almost droning main melody. And they take that,
and develop it, through rhythm and harmony, until it's almost unrecognizable. And then
everything changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hawkwind, "World of Tiers"&lt;/b&gt;: typical Hawkwind. If you like them, you'll like
  this. If you don't, you won't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Flower Kings, "Rumble Fish Twist"&lt;/b&gt;: a live track by the Flower Kings. Every time I go for a while without listening to tFK, I'm amazed when I turn them on. Roine Stolt and company are just so incredible. To me, there's a kind of near perfection about the Flower Kings work that no one else comes close to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kruzenshtern and Parahod, "Focus Pocus"&lt;/b&gt;: Some of the strangest stuff I&amp;#39;ve ever
  listened to. K&amp;amp;P are somewhere between progressive Klezmer, Jazz, and noise... They&amp;#39;re really amazing, but hard to describe or classify. If you can find a copy of one of their CDs, I highly recommend it, but they&amp;#39;re very hard to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gong, "Infinitea"&lt;/b&gt;: This band is yet another example of the "How did I not know about these guys?" phenomenon. They've been around for quite a while, coming out of
the Manchester scene. They're basically a spinoff of sorts from Soft Machine. They are
a really amazing progressive band, from the Jazzy side of things. They've been doing stuff
since the 70s, and are still making new albums now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Reasoning, "Dark Angel"&lt;/b&gt;: This is a band that I can't make up my mind about. They're neo-prog. They've got brilliant moments, and they've got a lot of moments that are rather dull. I can't quite decide what I think on balance; I need to listen to them a bit more. On the good side, they've got three members with good (but &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different) voices, and do a lot of really nice vocal harmony work, which is unusual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uriah Heep, "What Kind of God?"&lt;/b&gt;: A great disappointment. I've heard about
Uriah Heep for the longest time, and I finally got around to buying one of their albums. I find it just intolerably dull. Really profoundly mediocre music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sonic Youth, "Silver Rocker (live)"&lt;/b&gt;: old Sonic Youth. I really love SY, and I
  think that their songwriter has gotten stronger over the years. But there's still a raw
  energy to their early stuff which the new can't match. It's still the same sound, and the
  older songs can sometimes tend towards being a bit on the simple side, but there's still
  something really special in their older material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sylvan, "Strange Emotion"&lt;/b&gt;: And another mixed bag. I was looking at other reviews of Sylvan, and someone described them as "Emo Prog". Not a bad description. It's definitely neo-prog, with the kinds of sound and structure that you'd expect; but it's got that mopey, self-absorbed feeling of emo-dreck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Wishing Tree, "Ostara"&lt;/b&gt;: And still another mixed one. This is Steve Rothery's band. (Rothery is the guitarist from Marillion.) I'm a huge Rothery fan - he's got both
fantastic technical chops, and also fantastic musical taste. He's not just a loud fancy
guitarist; he's a very &lt;em&gt;musical&lt;/em&gt; guitarist. He's got an extremely distinctive style,
and yet also manages to fit himself into whatever's going on around him. This album has
some absolutely &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; material; but it's also got a lot of really dull
derivative stuff. The singer (Hannah Stobart) has a really beautiful voice, but she
doesn't have her own style. She always sounds like she's trying to be someone else. Mostly that's Kate Bush, but at times, she sounds like she's trying to be Tori Amos, or
Melissa Etheridge. But you can almost always listen to her and say "She's trying to
sound like X". On the whole, I like them, but think they'd be much better if Ms. Stobart
just figured out how to sound like &lt;em&gt;herself&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

Casey Luskin is once again hard at work in the Discovery Institute quote mines. In his latest effort, he tries to make the case that a &lt;a href="http://www.biochemj.org/bj/417/0029/4170029.pdf" rel="external "&gt;recent review article&lt;/a&gt; by Kevin Padian and the Panda’s Thumb’s own Nick Matzke contains “veiled threats” designed to intimidate &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2005/11/missing-link-cd.html" rel=""&gt;cdesign proponentsists&lt;/a&gt;. Casey dives into the quote mines in the first paragraph of the post:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s always amusing how evolutionists continually proclaim, and then re-proclaim, the apparent demise of intelligent design (ID) (i.e. ‘no really, this time ID actually is dead!’!). We’re pretty used to that, but then it gets a little creepy when they exude what appears to be an unhealthy pleasure in ID’s (purported) demise. Such was recently the exact case when National Center for Science Education (NCSE) president Kevin Padian and former NCSE spokesman Nick Matzke, in a January issue of Biochemical Journal, published a “review article” claiming that the “case for ID” has “collapsed,” gleefully asserting that “no one with scientific or philosophical integrity is going to take [Discovery Institute or ID] seriously in future.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Whenever someone from the Discovery Institute quotes a scientist, it’s a good idea to go back to the original source. That’s particularly true in cases like this, where the quoted material consists of several sentence fragments. Unsurprisingly, when we check the original source, we find that the quoted passages occur several paragraphs apart.

There are many similarities - both store and process information. But the fundamental architecture and function of the silicon on your desktop and the meat inside your skull are very different. That is why computers which are merely scaled up in power and speed will not spontaneously become conscious.The computational paradigm offers some insights into how the brain works, but it is not enough. Neuroscientists are searching for deeper understanding of brain function, particularly how it relates to consciousness. For example, it is known that the brain is organized as a massively parallel processor. There is also the neural network model of brain organization which tries to understand the brain as a collection of overlapping patterns of connectedness (networks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time there is a modular model of the brain which tries to understand brain function as a collection of anatomically identifiable modules that each have a specific function and interact interact to create the net effect of both consciousness and subconscious processing. I think that the network model and modular model are not mutually exlusive but are each part of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a newly published paper in &lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000314"&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt; argues that the brain operates at a critical point between organization and chaos - a state previously described as self-organized criticality. This is more of a description of the dynamic function of the brain, rather than its organization, and again is complementary to the modular and network models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Organized Criticality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) emerged out of physics, mathematics, and efforts to understand complexity in nature. SOC explains how complexity can spontaneously emerge from simple interactions, such as individual cells interacting with each other. Such complexity would have various features. These include the property of being scale invariant - meaning that the overall structure of the complexity does not change significantly at different scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds familiar it’s because that is the defining feature of fractals described by Benoît Mandelbrot. As you scale up and down through a fractal pattern the amount of complexity remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature of SOC is that it occurs at the critical point between ordered and random behavior, such as might exist between different phases of matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a very important feature was described in 1987 by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld - that complexity in an SOC system emerges in a robust manner, which means it is not sensitively dependent on conditions. Therefore, the system can maintain its complexity even through great changes in the parameters of the system - the system does not have to be “finely tuned” in order for complexity to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all this means is that a dynamic system, even one made of relatively simple parts with individual interactions that are also simple, can spontaneously generate complexity in a robust way - and exactly the kind of complexity we see in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOC and the Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manfred Kitzbichler and his coauthors decided to look at brain function to see if it also has the features of self-organized criticality. They thought that SOC would be a good model for brain function because it optimizes information transfer, memory capacity, and sensitivity to external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked specifically to see if brain complexity exhibits the feature of scale invariant complexity - if patterns in the brain are similar across scales of space and time. They examined a phenomenon known as phase coupling - essentially different parts of the brain firing in synchrony, presumably because they are part of a functional network - and measured how this coupling changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found is that this feature of brain activity does indeed have the signature features of self-organizing criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is an extremely complex topic and no one study such as this will be the final word. But they do appear to have provided the first direct evidence of SOC in the overall dynamic function of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If further investigations support this conclusion then this new way of looking at brain function is likely to deepen our understanding of what is perhaps the most complex system studied by science. This might also help us one day design computers that are more like human brains. Perhaps what this means is that such computers will have to be “grown” not built - they will also have to have complexity emerging out of self-organization, functioning at the edge of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, I’ll let you comically rub your eyes with your fists for a second, then check that yes, you did indeed read that correctly. The ICR — a wretched hive of scum and villainy — thinks that it’s doing science research (and boy &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/05/01/peer-reviewed-creationist-research-hahahahahahahaha/"&gt;is it not&lt;/a&gt;), and it’s not fair that they can’t grant science degrees! Now, this is not really surprising, seeing that the ICR can’t grasp reality with both hands, a vise, and a lifetime supply of crazy glue, but still. It’s funny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this poor sap in the State legislature is trying to get &lt;a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/HB02800I.htm"&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; passed to exempt the ICR from the ruling that they can’t grant advanced degrees. I’ll add that the bill is more general than that; the original news item claims it’s driven by the ICR, but the bill itself would actually allow &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; private institution to grant advanced degrees in science, which would bring down even more chaos on the Lone Star State. Unless you think a Masters of Astrology or a PhD in Flat Earth Studies is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the level of insanity infecting Texas politics right now, I have no idea if this bill will pass or not. The ICR &lt;a href="http://blogs.chron.com/keepthefaith/2008/04/master_of_science_degree_in_cr.html"&gt;tried to get permission&lt;/a&gt; to grant degrees in science in 2008, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/04/24/icr-at-0-degrees/"&gt;and was roundly thumped by the state commissioner&lt;/a&gt; who told them bluntly that religion isn’t science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have little doubt — just look at their &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;, for Pete’s sake — that the ICR is not doing science. It’s doing dogma. Nothing will ever convince them the Earth isn’t 6000 years old, and that the Bible isn’t the literal truth.

&lt;p&gt;I suspect a bill like this doesn’t have much a chance, but then &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy?s=mcleroy"&gt;the guy running the State Board of Education is an avowed creationist&lt;/a&gt; and thinks abstinence-only education is a grand idea, so there is literally no way of knowing this bill’s fate. Let’s all cross our fingers, throw salt over our shoulders, and rub our lucky rabbit’s feet that it fails. And these methods should work — I have a PhD in Superstionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, just to make sure I get on &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/05/14/the-icrs-enemies-list/"&gt;the ICR’s enemies list&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, exactly, does flavoring tofu like celebrity sweat solve the problem of people not knowing how to cook it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, it’s CLOONEY flavored tofu - clearly I should cook it the same way I cook other Clooney flavored things!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It's called &lt;a href="http://www.walkscore.com/"&gt;Walk Score&lt;/a&gt; and it gauges the pedestrian-friendliness of locations. Type in any address or pair of cross streets in the U.S. (or Europe for that matter), and the site maps the area and plots the nearby recreational, commercial, cultural, and social amenities. Even better, for the quantitatively inclined, it assigns each location a walk score on a 0 to 100 scale.

I was grateful to be able to watch the video, mostly because I wanted to hear how the folks at Apple pronounce the name of the iPhone-centric game designing firm &lt;a href="http://blog.ngmoco.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ngmoco:)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The namers of &lt;strong&gt;ngmoco:)&lt;/strong&gt; are setting the bar very high in the &amp;quot;weird Web 2.0 branding&amp;quot; department: it&amp;#39;s all lower-case, with an emoticon tacked on at the end. And of course it starts with the consonant cluster &lt;em&gt;ngm&lt;/em&gt;. If &lt;em&gt;ng&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to represent the velar nasal [ŋ], then the cluster [ŋm] is something we'd only see in English medially  in the word &lt;em&gt;engma&lt;/em&gt; (one name for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_nasal"&gt;velar nasal&lt;/a&gt;) or straddling a morphemic boundary as in &lt;em&gt;hangman&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ringmaster&lt;/em&gt;. Some languages might be able to handle initial [ŋm] — from a quick look, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CEtxAAAAIAAJ"&gt;Wambaya&lt;/a&gt; in northern Australia appears to be one of them, and possibly some Inuit languages as well. (But not &lt;a href="http://www.lasatha.org/vald/list/0210.txt"&gt;Vulcan&lt;/a&gt;, sadly.) In English,  initial velar nasal is a no-no, let alone an initial cluster with another nasal, [m]. Even the syllabic velar nasal is a stumper for most Anglophones, as I discussed in my post on &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=528"&gt;Maya Soetoro-Ng&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can hear at about 50 minutes into the video, the actual pronunciation as used by Apple&amp;#39;s Scott Forstall and ngmoco:) CEO Neil Young is, more pedestrianly, [ɛn dʒi moʊ koʊ]. The name of the company, it turns out, is an acronym for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;ext &lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;eneration &lt;strong&gt;Mo&lt;/strong&gt;bile &lt;strong&gt;Co&lt;/strong&gt;mpany&lt;/em&gt;. When Young founded the company last year, some press accounts rendered the name as &lt;a href="http://www.unwiredview.com/2008/06/30/neil-young-leaves-electronic-arts-to-launch-ngmoco-for-next-gen-iphone-games-and-more/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NGMoCo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which at least makes the acronymic origin (and pronunciation) a bit more transparent. But on the company's &lt;a href="http://www.ngmoco.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;   you can see that they choose to render it as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;ng&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;moco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;:)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, with the &lt;em&gt;ng&lt;/em&gt; and trailing emoticon in red and the &lt;em&gt;moco&lt;/em&gt;  in blue. You know, just to add another bizarre typographical convention into the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps [ɛn dʒi] for &lt;em&gt;ng-&lt;/em&gt; is an obvious pronunciation to the techie crowd, if those letters are now widely recognized as standing for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ext &lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt;eneration&lt;/em&gt;. (As opposed to, say, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;o &lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt;ood&lt;/em&gt;.) Acronym Finder reveals a number of similar abbreviations, like &lt;a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/Next-Generation-Micro_Architecture-(Intel-Corporation)-(NGMA).html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NGMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Next Generation Micro-Architecture&lt;/em&gt; (Intel), &lt;a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/Next-Generation-Metropolitan-Area-Network-(UCSF)-(NGMAN).html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NGMAN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Next Generation Metropolitan Area Network&lt;/em&gt; (UCSF), and &lt;a href="http://www.acronymfinder.com/International-Conference-and-Exhibition-on-Next-Generation-Mobile-Applications%2c-Services%2c-and-Technologies-(NGMAST).html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NGMAST&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Next Generation Mobile Applications, Services, and Technologies&lt;/em&gt; (an international conference). But of course in all of those cases, the &lt;em&gt;NG&lt;/em&gt; is capitalized to indicate an initialism pronounced by letter names as [ɛn dʒi]. The creators of &lt;strong&gt;ngmoco:)&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, are too cool for capitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the pronunciation mixes an initialistic component (&lt;em&gt;N G&lt;/em&gt;) with an acronymic component (&lt;em&gt;mo co&lt;/em&gt;). This type of letter/word pronunciation combo isn't unusual in the tech world: consider &lt;em&gt;CD-ROM &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;JPEG&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. And just as &lt;em&gt;NG&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;ng&lt;/em&gt; has gained recognition as a conventional shortening of &lt;em&gt;next generation&lt;/em&gt;, the acronym &lt;em&gt;moco&lt;/em&gt; is popping up with increasing frequency as an acronym for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mo&lt;/strong&gt;bile &lt;strong&gt;co&lt;/strong&gt;mpany&lt;/em&gt; — as in  &lt;a href="http://www.moconews.net/"&gt;mocoNews.net&lt;/a&gt;, a site covering the mobile industry. &lt;a href="http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/"&gt;Nancy Friedman&lt;/a&gt; notes that the &lt;em&gt;moco&lt;/em&gt; acronym has the unfortunate meaning of &amp;quot;mucus&amp;quot; in Spanish, which didn&amp;#39;t stop Nissan from marketing a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_MR_Wagon"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; named the Moco. And &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001736.html"&gt;a few years ago&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft waged a battle to take over the domain name &lt;em&gt;mocosoft.com&lt;/em&gt; from a Spanish company with an odd sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of cross-linguistic issues, the clipping of &lt;em&gt;mobile company&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;moco&lt;/em&gt; is just the latest in a long line of syllabic acronymy that I discussed in my 2005 post &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002734.html"&gt;From Nabisco to NaNoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; At the &lt;a href="http://www.lsadc.org/info/preliminary-program09.cfm"&gt;LSA meetings&lt;/a&gt; in January, I was pleased to see that Kyle Gorman and Laurel MacKenzie of the University of Pennsylvania had taken some of the ideas I had tentatively raised in that post (specifically about such forms as &lt;em&gt;HoJo &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;SoHo&lt;/em&gt;) and worked up a genuine research project, as presented in their paper &amp;quot;&amp;#39;A Boho in SoHo&amp;#39;: Emerging specificity in English templatic hypocoristics.&amp;quot; You can see the PowerPoint of their presentation &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~laurel/Gorman_MacKenzie_LSA09.ppt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (where the title has been expanded a bit to &amp;quot;A Po-Mo Boho in Soho&amp;quot;). So now we can add   &lt;strong&gt;ngmoco:)&lt;/strong&gt; and its fellow &lt;em&gt;mocos&lt;/em&gt; to the ever-growing list of what Gorman and MacKenzie call &amp;quot;CoCo hypocoristics.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237572041893"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/faces_of_prosopagnisa">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79c687ff3132e1d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Faces of Prosopagnisa</title><published>2009-03-20T17:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T17:59:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/faces_of_prosopagnisa" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spoospa/122910924/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/38/122910924_72f036e7f9_m.jpg" alt="four versions of a young white blond female, left to right and top to bottom: high contrast sepia tone, black and white, posterized, regular photo" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.faceblind.org/research/"&gt;Prosopagnosia&lt;/a&gt; (face blindness) is difficulty in recognizing people by their faces, even people who are well known such as a parent or spouse.  Many people on the spectrum report prosopagnosia and there are claims that prosopagnosia is more prevalent in the autistic population than it is in some other groups (though I haven't seen any references to actual studies).  Prosopagnisa is generally thought to be a brain thing because people can acquire it after a head injury or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="http://esciencenews.com/articles/2009/03/18/mit.why.we.have.difficulty.recognizing.faces.photo.negatives"&gt;MIT study on facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; (or lack thereof) in photographic negatives found that the structures around eyes seem to be important in facial recognition.  The article that's been circulating about the study speculates,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have shown that people with autism tend to focus on the mouths of people they are looking at, rather than the eyes, so the new findings could help explain why autistic people have such difficulty recognizing faces, says Sinha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd speculate further that anyone who has &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/considering_visual_processing_in_reading_emotions"&gt;difficulty making sense of visual stimuli&lt;/a&gt; is likely to have trouble recognizing faces.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Smith has written some informative articles about &lt;a href="http://www.thiswayoflife.org/faceblind.html"&gt;face blindness&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href="http://www.thiswayoflife.org/faceblindcoping.html"&gt;strategies for living with face blindness&lt;/a&gt;, from an autistic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237571573193"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/if_you_fail_an_iq_test_in_texa.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6fefdbf8f7c75547</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">If you fail an IQ test in Texas, do they automatically put you in the legislature?</title><published>2009-03-20T17:30:24Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T17:30:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/028IYNFsog0/if_you_fail_an_iq_test_in_texa.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/if_you_fail_an_iq_test_in_texa.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm trying figure out how this &lt;a href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/texans_please_dont_let_this_flat_earth_bs_happen/"&gt;insane bill could even get a hearing&lt;/a&gt;. State Representative Leo Berman (R, of course) was peeved that the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board ruled that the Institute for Creation Research would not be allowed to grant degrees. So, he came up with an amazingly stupid idea: pass a law that would allow private, non-profit education institutions  to grant degrees without the board's permission. Which, if you think about it, is actually kind of brilliant in the sense that it's hard to imagine a &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it were to pass, though, I'd like to move to Texas for a few months, open a free daycare, and issue doctoral degrees to every toddler who can go a day without pooping his pants. I'd have the diplomas printed on diapers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's about what a degree from a Texas university would be worth if Berman had his way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope all you Texans with real degrees from real universities are frantically writing off to your representatives explaining why this would be a &lt;i&gt;very bad idea&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/if_you_fail_an_iq_test_in_texa.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/028IYNFsog0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237570394301"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/20/doctor-who-specials-finale-rumor/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/230e9281f81fb003</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Doctor Who specials finale rumor</title><published>2009-03-20T17:26:08Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T17:26:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/20/doctor-who-specials-finale-rumor/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, HUGE Doctor Who finale rumor spoiler, so seriously and for real don’t read this if you want to stay unspoiled!&lt;/p&gt;

Simm played The Master in Series 4 in the two-part finale. The Master was seen to die, but there was some ambiguity at the end of the finale. &lt;/p&gt;

This is the paper I'll be reading to the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/02/ill-be-speaking-at-mid-west-region-of.html"&gt;Evangelical Philosophical Society&lt;/a&gt; later today. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE OUTSIDER TEST FOR FAITH&lt;/strong&gt;           &lt;br&gt;by John W. Loftus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important question of all when it comes to assessing the truth claims of Christian theism is whether we should approach the available evidence through the eyes of faith, or of skepticism. Complete neutrality, while desirable, seems to be practically impossible, since the worldview we use to evaluate the evidence is already there prior to looking at the evidence. So the question I’ll be addressing today is whether we should adopt a believing or a skeptical predisposition prior to examining the evidence for a religious set of beliefs. I’ll argue that a skeptical predisposition is the preferred one to adopt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My &lt;em&gt;Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/em&gt; (OTF) is just one of several arguments I use to demonstrate that when examining the evidence for a religious set of beliefs the predisposition of skepticism is warranted. There is overwhelming, undeniable and non-controversial evidence for the test itself that can be found in the sociological, anthropological, and psychological data. I’ll start with some of this data that forms the basis for the test. Then I’ll describe the test, provide some examples of what it demands of the believer, and defend it from six major objections. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a great deal of discussion among Christian apologists over Bayesian “background factors,” which play a significant role in assessing the truth of Christianity in general, the likelihood of the resurrection of Jesus, the probability of miracles, and the problem of evil. But the most important background factor of all for cognitively assessing the truth claims of religious faith is one’s sociological and cultural background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basis for the outsider test has been stated adequately by liberal Christian philosopher John Hick: “It is evident that in some ninety-nine percent of the cases the religion which an individual professes and to which he or she adheres depends upon the accidents of birth.” That is to say, if we were born in Saudi Arabia, we would be Sunni Muslims right now. If we were born in Iran, we’d be Shi’a Muslims. If we were born in India, we’d be a Hindus. If we were born in Japan, we’d be Shintoists. If we were born in Mongolia, we’d be Buddhists. If we were born in the first century BCE in Israel, we’d adhere to the Jewish faith at that time, and if we were born in Europe in 1000 CE, we’d be Roman Catholics. For the first nine hundred years we would’ve believed in the ransom theory of Jesus’ atonement. As Christians during the later Middle Ages, we wouldn’t have seen anything wrong with killing witches, torturing heretics, and conquering Jerusalem from the “infidels” in the Crusades. These things are as close to being undeniable facts as we can get in the sociological world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Had we lived in ancient Egypt or Babylon, we would’ve been very superstitious and polytheistic to the core. In the ancient world, we would’ve sought divine guidance through divination, tried to alter circumstances through magic, and believed in the dreaded evil eye. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a whole range of issues that admit of diversity in the moral and political areas as well, based to an overwhelming degree on the “accidents of birth.” Caucasian American men would’ve believed with President Andrew Jackson in manifest destiny, our God-given mandate to seize Native American territories in westward expansion. Up through the seventeenth century we would’ve believed that women were intellectually inferior to men, and consequently we wouldn’t have allowed them to become educated in the same subjects as men, much less to vote. Like Thomas Jefferson and most Americans, we would’ve thought this way about black people as well, that they were intellectually inferior to whites, while if we were born in the South, we would’ve justified slavery from the Bible. If in today’s world we were born in the Palestinian Gaza strip, we would hate the Jews and probably want to kill them all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These kinds of moral, political, and religious beliefs, based upon cultural conditions, can be duplicated into a lengthy list of beliefs that we would’ve had if we were born in a different time and place. Voltaire was right: “Every man is a creature of the age in which he lives, and few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of their time.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Social conditions provide us with the initial control beliefs we use from that moment on to incorporate all known facts and experiences. That’s why they’re called control beliefs. They are somewhat like blinders. From the moment we put them on, we pretty much see only what our blinders will let us see, because reason is mostly used to serve them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Shermer, a former Christian turned atheist, has done an extensive study of why people believe in God and in “weird things.” He argues: “Most of us most of the time come to our beliefs for a variety of reasons having little to do with empirical evidence and logical reasoning. Rather, such variables as genetic predispositions, parental predilections, sibling influences, peer pressures, educational experiences, and life impressions all shape the personality preferences and emotional inclinations that, in conjunction with numerous social and cultural influences, lead us to make certain belief choices. Rarely do any of us sit down before a table of facts, weigh them pro and con, and choose the most logical and rational belief, regardless of what we previously believed. Instead, the facts of the world come to us through the colored filters of the theories, hypotheses, hunches, biases, and prejudices we have accumulated through our lifetime. We then sort through the body of data and select those most confirming what we already believe, and ignore or rationalize away those that are disconfirming. All of us do this, of course, but smart people are better at it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian philosopher Robert McKim concurs in some respects. He wrote: “We seem to have a remarkable capacity to find arguments that support positions which we antecedently hold. Reason is, to a great extent, the slave of prior commitments.” Hence the whole notion of “an independent rational judgment” is suspect, he claims. This is not to deny that Christian apologists defend their faith with reasons. Of course they do. These apologists, if they’re good at what they do, will be smart people. But as Michael Shermer also reminds us, “smart people, because they are more intelligent and better educated, are able to give intellectual reasons justifying their beliefs that they arrived at for nonintelligent reasons.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Psychiatrist Dr. Valerie Tarico describes the process of defending unintelligent beliefs by smart people. She claims, “it doesn’t take very many false assumptions to send us on a long goose chase.” To illustrate this she tells us about the mental world of a paranoid schizophrenic. To such a person the perceived persecution by the CIA sounds real. “You can sit, as a psychiatrist, with a diagnostic manual next to you, and think: as bizarre as it sounds, the CIA really is bugging this guy. The arguments are tight, the logic persuasive, the evidence organized into neat files. All that is needed to build such an impressive house of illusion is a clear, well-organized mind and a few false assumptions. Paranoid individuals can be very credible.” In her opinion this is what Christians do and best explains why it’s hard to shake the evangelical faith. Of course, I don’t expect Christians to agree with her that this is what they do, but then they cannot deny that people of religious faith do this. What else can best explain why there is still a Mormon church now that DNA evidence conclusively proves Native Americans did not come from the Middle East? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve investigated my faith from the inside as an insider with the presumption that it was true. Even from an insider’s perspective with the Christian set of control beliefs, I couldn’t continue to believe. Now from the outside, it makes no sense at all. Christians are on the inside. I am now on the outside. Christians see things from the inside. I see things from the outside. From the inside, it seems true. From the outside, it seems almost bizarre. As Mark Twain wisely said, “The easy confidence with which I know another man’s religion is folly teaches me to suspect that my own is also.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This whole inside/outside perspective is quite a dilemma and prompts me to propose and argue on behalf of the OTF, the result of which makes the presumption of skepticism the preferred stance when approaching any religious faith, especially one’s own. The outsider test is simply a challenge to test one’s own religious faith with the presumption of skepticism, as an outsider. It calls upon believers to "Test or examine your religious beliefs as if you were outsiders with the same presumption of skepticism you use to test or examine other religious beliefs." Its presumption is that when examining any set of religious beliefs skepticism is warranted, since the odds are good that the particular set of religious beliefs you have adopted is wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OTF is no different than the prince in the Cinderella story who must question forty-five thousand girls to see which one lost the glass slipper at the ball last night. They all claim to have done so. Therefore, skepticism is definitely warranted. This is especially the case when an empirical foot match cannot be had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The amount of skepticism warranted depends on the number of rational people who disagree, whether the people who disagree are separated into distinct geographical locations, the nature of those beliefs, how they originated, how they were personally adopted in the first place, and the kinds of evidence that can possibly be used to decide between them. My claim is that when it comes to religious beliefs a high degree of skepticism is warranted because of these factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surely someone will initially object that this is quite draconian in scope. Why take such an extreme stance? It’s because that’s how religious people approach all of the other religious faiths but their own. If someone claims she cannot do this because no one can test anything without assumptions of some kind, then this test challenges the believer to switch her assumptions. If she simply cannot do this, then let me suggest doing what René Descartes did with a methodological (or hypothetical) doubt, although I’m not suggesting his type of extreme doubt. Hypothetically consider your faith from the perspective of an outsider. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she refuses to do this then she must justify having such a double standard. Why does she test other religious beliefs differently than her own? For someone to object that what I’m asking is unfair, she has the burden of proof to show why her inconsistent approach to religious faith is justified in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ll grant that what I’m asking is a tough thing to do. That’s because, as anthropologist Dr. David Eller argues, our culturally inherited beliefs are what we use to see with. We don’t see culture. We see with culture. Our culturally inherited beliefs are much like our very eyes themselves. We cannot easily pluck out our eyes to look at them. But we must attempt this if we truly want to examine that which we were taught to believe. Only the honest the consistent and the brave will ever do this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the Christian theist the challenge of the outsider test means there would be no more quoting the Bible to defend the claim that Jesus’ death on the cross saves us from sins. The Christian theist must now try to rationally explain it. No more quoting the Bible to show how it’s possible for Jesus to be 100% God and 100% man with nothing left over. The Christian theist must now try to make sense of this claim, coming as it does from an ancient superstitious people who didn’t have trouble believing Paul and Barnabas were “gods in human form” (Acts 14:11; 28:6). The Christian theist must not assume prior to examining the evidence that there is an answer to the problem of horrendous suffering in our world either. And she’d be initially skeptical of believing in any of the miracles in the Bible, just as she would be skeptical of any claims of the miraculous in today’s world supporting other religious faiths. Why? Because she cannot start out by first believing the Bible, nor can she trust the people close to her who are Christian theists to know the truth, nor can she trust her own anecdotal religious experiences, since such experiences are had by people of all religious faiths who differ about the cognitive content learned as the result of these experiences. She would want evidence and reasons for these beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The outsider test also challenges believers to examine the social and cultural conditions of how they came to adopt their particular religious faith in the first place. That is, believers must ask themselves who or what influenced them and what the actual reasons were for adopting their faith in its earliest stages. Christian, just ask yourself whether the initial reasons you had for adopting your faith were strong ones. Just think about the problems you’ve experienced in your churches along with the intellectual problems you wrestle with in meetings like these. If you could go back in time knowing what you know now about how Christians behave in the church would you still choose to believe? And those initial arguments that convinced you to believe would surely be thought of by you as simplistic and unworthy of your consideration today. Just ask yourself if you would’ve become a Mormon instead, had a joyous friendly Mormon group approached you at that same vulnerable time in your life. Most all of us, most all of the time, do not have good initial reasons to accept our religious faith, which from that time forward acts like a set of blinders with regard to how we see the evidence. We just end up believing what we were taught to believe by people we trust in a Christian dominated culture. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the very minimum, a believer should be willing to subject her faith to rigorous scrutiny by reading many of the best-recognized critiques of her faith, most of which are written by other professing believers. Evangelical faith, for instance, can be thought of as a small branch out on a limb called Christianity which is attached to a huge tree called religion. The debate should start by settling the question of which Christianity represents true Christianity in our world today. Then too today’s Christian faith bears little resemblance to the theologies and the ethics of the Christianities in the past, and it will bear little resemblance to future Christianities because the Christian faith is like a chameleon, ever changing with the progression of knowledge. But once that debate between Christians is settled, if that’s even remotely possible, the next debate is between Christianity and all other religions on the planet. I claim evangelicals cannot win the first debate, much less the second one. Cultural anthropologist Dr. David Eller is right: “Nothing is more destructive to religion than other religions; it is like meeting one’s own anti-matter twin.” (p. 233).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nonetheless, if after having investigated your religious faith with the presumption of skepticism it passes intellectual muster, then you can have your religious faith. It’s that simple. If not, abandon it like I did. I suspect that if someone is willing to take the challenge of the outsider test, then her religious faith will be found defective and she will abandon it along with all other religious faiths, like it has me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answering Six Major Objections: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One:&lt;/strong&gt; Religious believers will all object that the OTF does not show their particular religion to be false simply because it’s an overwhelming sociological fact that we believe based upon when and where we were born. William Lane Craig asks, “How does the mere presence of religious worldviews incompatible with Christianity show that distinctively Christian claims are not true? Logically, the existence of multiple, incompatible truth claims only implies that all of them cannot be (objectively) true; but it would be obviously fallacious to infer that not one of them is (objectively) true.” He’s right about this, as are Muslims and Mormons who can say the same thing with regard to their respective faiths. After all, someone can be right if for no other reason than that she just got lucky to be born when and where she did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how do you rationally justify such luck? This is why I’ve developed the challenge of the outsider test in the first place, to test religious faiths against such luck. If the test between religious faiths is based entirely on luck, then what are the chances, based on luck alone, that the particular sect within Christian theism that one adheres to is correct? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s objected that there are small minorities of people who choose to be Christian theists who were born and raised in Muslim countries and that people can escape their culturally adopted faith. This is true. But these are the exceptions. Christian theists respond by asking me to explain the exceptions. I’m asking them to explain the rule. Why do religious beliefs dominate in specific geographical areas? Why is that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to these converts, my opinion is that most of them do not objectively weigh the evidence when making their initial religious commitments. They mainly change their minds due to the influence and believability of the evangelist and/or the wondrous nature of the religious story itself. They have no initial way of truly investigating the proffered faith. Which evangelist will objectively tell the ugly side of the Bible and of the Church while preaching the good news? None that I know of. Which evangelist will tell a prospect about the innumerable problems that Christian scholars like yourselves wrestle with in meetings like this? None that I know of. Which evangelist will give a prospect a copy of a book like mine along with a copy of a Christian apologetics book, and ask her to read them both before making a decision? Again, none that I know of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s objected that merely because rational people disagree about something does not justify skepticism about a particular claim. On the contrary, I think it can and it does. The amount of skepticism warranted depends on the criteria I mentioned earlier. Rational people don’t bet against gravity, for instance, because there is evidence for it that was learned apart from what she was taught to believe in a geographically distinct location. She can personally test it. I’m claiming religious beliefs are in a different category than the results of repeatable scientific experiments, and that this claim is both obvious and non-controversial. Skepticism is best expressed on a continuum, anyway. Some belief claims will warrant more skepticism than others. I’m claiming that religious beliefs warrant probably the highest skepticism given the sociological facts. At the risk of offending believers here, religious beliefs, like beliefs in the Elves of Iceland, the trolls of Norway, and the power of witches in Africa, must be subjected to the highest levels of skepticism given both the extraordinary nature of these claims and how some of these beliefs are adopted in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four.&lt;/strong&gt; Someone may object that my argument is self-defeating. They’ll ask: “Do my cultural conditions overwhelmingly ‘determine’ my presumption of skepticism? If so, then, as Alvin Plantinga questions, are my beliefs “produced by an unreliable belief-producing process” too? If not, then why do I think I can transcend culture but a Christian theist can’t transcend her culture?” In answer I think it’s extremely difficult to transcend our culture because, as I mentioned before, it provides us with the very eyes we use to see with. But precisely because we know from anthropological and psychological studies that this is what culture does to us, it’s possible to transcend the culture we were raised in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Example] We know that people do not truly see or hear reality as it is. What we see is filtered by our eyes. What we hear is filtered by our ears. We see and hear only a very limited amount of data in the world. But if we saw and heard the whole electromagnetic and sonic spectra we’d basically see and hear white noise. We know this even though we can’t actually see or hear the white noise for ourselves. We also know that the ground we walk on is moving like a swarm of bees on the microscopic level. So it’s this scientific knowledge about the world which leads us to be skeptical about that which we see and hear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same thing is can be said when it comes to anthropological and psychological studies that show we should be skeptical of that which we were led to believe, even though we can’t actually see anything about our beliefs to be skeptical about. And the OTF is as sure of a test as we can come up with to examine our culturally adopted beliefs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The truth is that my argument is not self-defeating at all. It suggests we should doubt what we believe. It’s not self-defeating to say the odds are that we are wrong. After all, we’re talking about the odds here. Agnostic philosopher J. L. Schellenberg deals with this same type of criticism in these words: “Now this objection can be sound only if my arguments do indeed apply to themselves, and it will not take much to see that they do not.” For there is a huge difference between defending a religious set of beliefs as the one and only correct set, and denying that a set of religious beliefs is justified. His claim is that the adherents of any given religious set of beliefs “have not successfully made their case; it bides us to continue investigation . . . because skepticism is always a position of last resort in truth seeking contexts.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five.&lt;/strong&gt; In arguing that one’s religious faith is overwhelmingly adopted by the “accidents of birth,” have I committed the informal genetic fallacy of irrelevance? This fallacy is committed whenever it’s argued that a belief is false because of the origination of the belief. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t think the genetic fallacy is as much of a big deal as people think it is, especially in religious contexts. If someone has a paranoid belief about the CIA spying on him and we find that the genesis (or origin) of his belief comes from him taking a hallucinogenic drug like L.S.D., then we have some really good evidence to be skeptical of his paranoid belief, even though we have not actually shown his belief to be false in any other way, and even though by doing so someone could say we have committed the genetic fallacy. So in a like manner if we can determine that the origins of the earliest Christianities were created purely by ancient superstitious human beings, we have good grounds for skepticism. But even more to the point, if all of our beliefs are completely determined by our environment then that’s the case regardless of the fact that by arguing for this it commits the genetic fallacy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, there is no genetic fallacy here unless by explaining how believers first adopt their faith I therefore conclude that such a faith is false. I’m not arguing that these faiths are false because of how believers originally adopted them. I’m merely arguing believers should be skeptical of their culturally adopted religious faith because of how they first adopted them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six.&lt;/strong&gt; One final objection asks whether this is all circular. Have I merely chosen a different metaphysical belief system based upon different cultural factors? I deny this, for I have very good initial grounds for starting out with skepticism based upon the sociological, anthropological and psychological facts. Methodological procedures are those tests we use to investigate something. How we go about investigating something is a separate issue that must be justified on its own terms, and I have done so here. Someone cannot say of the outsider test that I ought to be just as skeptical of it as I am about the conclusions I arrive at when I apply the test, since I have justified this test from the facts. One must first dispute the outsider test on its own terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To see me defend this test further &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/answering-dr-repperts-criticisms-of.html"&gt;read my response to Dr. Victor Reppert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-6256184247801903812?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a man wants to make a women his b****, so be it? So what if you don't like it, what if I do?
&lt;p&gt;
If I want to do something, and my conscience is cool with it, then I can do it. If it's feed a homeless person, so be it. If it's kill my neighbor, so be it. I am not bound to any morals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wha…? That&amp;#39;s not what an atheist would say; it sounds more like an ignorant Christian &lt;i&gt;caricature&lt;/i&gt; of an atheist. And what do you know, &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/03/20/pastor-gets-caught-lying-for-jesus/"&gt;it was&lt;/a&gt;. Even better, the fellow who is doing this is &lt;a href="http://www.kendallsbaptistchurch.org/staff.cfm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pastor&lt;/i&gt; Chris Fox of Kendalls Baptist Church in New London, NC&lt;/a&gt;. He has been confronted with his dishonesty, and he sees nothing wrong with it, even. Way to represent Christian morality, pastor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is acceptable Christian behavior, I guess that means I can visit various Christian sites, pretend to be born-again, and chatter about how that means I have acquired a taste for human flesh and want to gun down random people so they can go to heaven faster. Oh, wait, darn…I&amp;#39;m an atheist! I&amp;#39;m bound by &lt;i&gt;human, social&lt;/i&gt; patterns of acceptable behavior, and don't have an imaginary friend in the sky to give me a pardon for lying. Oops.

The physics-based game runs on a simple premise: get your green rocket to the purple swirly thing. To do this you'll need to navigate the gravitational fields of numerous 'pods', which will pull your rocket off course. Of course, like the boffins at NASA / ESA you must learn to use these gravitational fields to slingshot your craft to its destination. There's a lot of trial and error involved, and your map is slowly painted in delightful swirly patterns showing the paths of failed rockets. So go, live out your Colin Pillinger fantasies!

&lt;p&gt;You remember Vox "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/hey_it_worked_for_hitler_1.php"&gt;Hey, it worked for Hitler&lt;/a&gt;" Day," don't you? It's been a long time. In fact, I had to do a search to find the last time I had a run-in with him, and it appears that it's been about a year since I last noted him &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/vox_day_mindlessly_parroting_antivaccina.php"&gt;mindlessly parroting antivaccinationist myths&lt;/a&gt; and spouting &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/vox_days_misogyny.php"&gt;his usual misogyny&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, Vox has been a regular &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/04/someone-noticed-me.html"&gt;irritant&lt;/a&gt; to this blog since very early on, when he didn't like my &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/04/i-thought-taliban-only-existed-in.html"&gt;likening his views towards women&lt;/a&gt; to the Taliban for his arguing that women shouldn't be allowed to vote because they are "&lt;a href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/2005/04/why-women-shouldnt-vote-reason-345-346.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;fascists at heart&lt;/a&gt;." Since then, every so often it's been one thing after another, whether it be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/more_antivaccination_nonsensebut_not_fro.php"&gt;parroting antivaccinationist lies&lt;/a&gt; as though he understood what he was talking about, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/vox_days_misogyny.php"&gt;in essence labeling Title IX a threat to science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/vox_gets_vile_again/"&gt;making excuses for rape&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/more_antiscience.php"&gt;rejecting evolution&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/obviously_a_male_conspiracy_is_at_work.php"&gt;misrepresenting a scientific study suggesting that moderate housework can decrease a woman's risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/08/ignorance-is-blitz/"&gt;attacking "materialist" philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. If I had to pick my favorite examples of Vox's utter vileness it would be obvious which two I'd pick. The runner-up would be when he expressed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/01/a_trio_of_terror_part_iii_the_search_for.php"&gt;more admiration for the Nazis than for feminists&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;em&gt;pièce de résistance&lt;/em&gt; of Vox crankitude occurred when he argued that it would be "possible" for the U.S. to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/hey_it_worked_for_hitler_1.php"&gt;solve our illegal immigration problem&lt;/a&gt; because the Nazis managed to expel millions of Jews from their territories, a screed that even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/vox_day_too_much_of_a_wingnut_1.php"&gt;WorldNet Daily couldn't stomach&lt;/a&gt; and edited to remove the offending Vox-isms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've often &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/postholiday_the_stupid_it_burns_part_1_j.php"&gt;complained about Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; as a sterling example of the "&lt;a href="http://photoninthedarkness.com/?p=140"&gt;arrogance of ignorance&lt;/a&gt;." Whatever the ignorant hubris that Jenny likes to lay down on a regular basis, however, she is limited by her puny intellect in just how much hubris generate (although it is that very same puny intellect that allows her to lay down such bursts of enormous stupidity that threaten to fry the brains of anyone with intelligence greater than one standard deviation below average). Over the years, though, I have noticed that it is not the puny intellects like Jenny McCarthy that are necessarily the most prone to the arrogance of ignorance. In fact, it is those with a modicum of intelligence, who, knowing they are intelligent, mistakenly believe that they are able to understand virtually anything without actually taking the time to do the hard work to learn the topic. Indeed, I rather suspect that's why Vox is willing to charge into any topic and lay down a blistering barrage of stupid with zero self-awareness, utterly unaware that he is making a fool of himself and at the same time utterly confident that he knows what he is talking about--more than that, utterly confident that he understands a topic better than people who have spent decades studying it and have dedicated their lives to it. Indeed, Vox is proof positive that the arrogance of ignorance is, if anything, far more dangerous and toxic in an intelligent person, so much so that it renders someone like Vox capable of laying down some of the most amazingly stupid rhetoric while simultaneously bragging about how smart he is. It's also proof positive that high "intelligence" as measured by IQ can in many cases has little or nothing to do with understanding or reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Vox sure thinks it does, which is why he's decided to tug on Superman's cape once again, if you know what I mean. Remember that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_most_massive_scientific_fraud_ever.php"&gt;post I did about a week ago&lt;/a&gt; about an anesthesiologist who had committed massive scientific fraud over the course of a dozen years or more? Remember how I said that the forces of anti-science would use this incident as "proof" that science is corrupt to its core and that, by extension, they must be correct? Vox Day is only the latest to fulfill this prediction. &lt;a href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/2009/03/if-you-hand-us-hammer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;And, boy, oh, boy, does he ever&lt;/a&gt;!

As you can see in this image of the fossil, it was bristling with a fuzz of thin fibers — proto-feathers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/03/tianyulong.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2009/03/tianyulong_sm.jpeg" width="400" height="516" alt="tianyulong_sm.jpeg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Click for larger image)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;, Main slab of the holotype (STMN 26-3). &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;, Broken slab. The scale bar in &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; refers also to &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;, Close-up of skull and mandible. &lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;, Interpretive drawing of skull and mandible. &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;, Close-up of dentition. Abbreviations: a, angular; aof, antorbital fossa; ca, caudal vertebrae; cv, cervical vertebrae; d, dentary; dv, dorsal vertebrae; emf, external mandibular fenestra; en, external naris; f, femur; h, humerus; isc, ischium; j, jugal; l, lacrimal; m, maxilla; n, nasal; pd, predentary; pf, prefrontal; pm, premaxilla; po, postorbital; pub, pubis; q, quadrate; qj, quadratojugal; scaco, scapulocoracoid; sa, surangular; tf, tibia and fibula.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of noteworthy features in this creature. One is apparent: feathers just didn't bloom suddenly in evolution, but appeared in steps. This animal has 'feathers' that don't branch like those of modern birds, but instead form more of a furry coat than a set of flat blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other cool thing is that this is an ornithischian dinosaur; most of the other dinosaurs that have been discovered to have feathers were saurischian. What that means might be made more clear by this diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/upload/2009/03/tianyulong_a_fuzzy_dinosaur_that_makes_the_origin_of_feather/Feathered-dinos.jpg" alt="Feathered-dinos.jpg" width="500" height="295"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It implies that just maybe the last common ancestor of the saurischia and ornithischia were also covered with proto-feathers, which means that feathers may be a primitive state in this lineage.&lt;/p&gt;

It starts with the headline: "&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/5011941/Gordon-Brown-is-frustrated-by-Psycho-in-No-10.html"&gt;Gordon Brown is frustrated by 'Psycho' in No 10&lt;/a&gt;". The sub-head then leads the reader down a parenthetical garden path with  virtuosic bravado (though purists may object to the use of missing punctuation):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;While not exactly a film buff, Gordon Brown was touched when Barack Obama gave him a set of 25 classic American movies – including Psycho, starring Anthony Perkins on his recent visit to Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In case some higher power intervenes to spoil this specimen, here's a screen shot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being insensitive to the finer points of British political and journalistic culture, I can't tell whether this is a sign of (a) cost-cutting, (b) educational failure, Youth Today, and the Decline of Civilization, (c) subtle editorial irony, or (d) all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of the story, by Tim Walker, appears to be linguistically unremarkable, at least with respect to the parsing of post-head modifiers. But American readers may be surprised at the assertion, in the reporter's voice, that a White House spokesman "sniggered":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;A White House spokesman sniggered when I put the story to him and he was still looking into the matter when my deadline came last night.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sniggering seems to be a routine feature of attributive tags at the Telegraph. Here's one from &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4838343/Antony-Gormleys-Fourth-Plinth-Trafalgar-Square.html"&gt;another recent story&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Yet, possibly as a result of the democratic message of his work, Gormley suffers a fraught relationship with the art establishment, who often look down on his output. Does he believe that he is the victim of critical snobbery? "I'm very – what is the right word? – suspect," he says, with a bitter snigger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I haven't found any other examples where sniggering isn't just a manner modifier in an attribution, but consitutes the entire quoted content of an official response.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237552564265"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/sattuna_radiocarbon.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a7fe95449f50b1c5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><title type="html">Sättuna Radiocarbon</title><published>2009-03-20T13:20:19Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T13:20:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~3/F0EZ2Txm6do/sattuna_radiocarbon.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/sattuna_radiocarbon.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last September I directed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/archaeology/fieldwork/"&gt;two weeks of excavations&lt;/a&gt; at Sättuna in Kaga, an amazing metal detector site I've been working at since 2006. I was hoping to find building foundations from a late-6th century aristocratic manor indicated by the metalwork. But I couldn't get permission to dig the most promising bit of the site. Instead my team of Chester students and I dug off to one side and found no end of pits and hearths, but hardly any artefacts at all. Those bits that we did find are lithics, apparently belonging to a Late Mesolithic shore site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got the radiocarbon results. They line up pretty well with what we knew from the artefact finds, with two exceptions: there's no late-6th century at all, and there's a funny 3rd Millennium BC date that corresponds to none of our finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that the people on this site avoided burying stuff that keeps, not just during one era, but over repeated use phases covering thousands of years. Drat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a whim, I've grown one of my infrequent beards, and it's starting to itch. The beard hairs are hard and bristly, and the mustache feels like having the skeleton of a herring glued to my upper lip. Kissing and snuggling my loved ones isn't at all as nice a usual, since the 'stache makes contact with them long before I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the compliments I've received, though, a beard seems to be the way to go if you're into ladies born in the 1940s. Another possible explanation for the data I have is that women of all ages love my beard, but that only ones of a certain age are daring enough to show their appreciation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/langobard.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/R0wJwPtq7qE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237544511985"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_238.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4db58b7041f22c42</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-03-20T08:52:59Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T08:52:59Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/XE2lDI-sTDg/clock_quotes_238.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_238.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is hard to go beyond your public.

&lt;p&gt;Once again, online friends have saved my @ss.  &lt;img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ingredients&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2 1/2 cups flour&lt;br&gt;
1/2 cup honey&lt;br&gt;
3 1/2 tsp baking powder&lt;br&gt;
1 tsp salt&lt;br&gt;
3 Tblsp vegetable oil&lt;br&gt;
1 cup milk&lt;br&gt;
2 eggs&lt;br&gt;
1 cup dry roasted crickets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grease and flour a loaf pan (9 x 5 x 3 inches). Add all ingredients except crickets in a large mixing bowl. Beat on medium speed for about 1/2 minute or until smooth. Add crickets and stir until well mixed , then pour into the pan. Bake at 350° 40-55 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the bread. Slice while hot. Serve with sweet butter a l’orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Sweet Butter a l’orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1/2 lb. sweet butter, softened&lt;br&gt;
2 Tblsp. grated orange rind (For an added touch, soak the rind in your favorite cordial)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix with fork, place in serving dish and refrigerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Dry Roasted Crickets&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spread fresh, frozen and cleaned crickets on paper towels on a cookie sheet. Bake at 200° for 1-2 hours until desired state of dryness is reached. Check state of dryness by attempting to crush the crickets with a spoon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central questions I have been asking my students as we've traveled around Greece to consider is: What is the good life? And, what is the good, and how do you choose to live your life in a way that's not simply "best" for you, but ethical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life with Charlie has led me to think a lot more than I might have about these questions. Maybe some would say that parenthood does that for anyone. But raising Charlie is different. Charlie has and is going to have needs for support and care and supervision throughout his life. And when Jim and I are gone, Charlie is for sure going to need the same amount and level of support and care and supervision, and without us to be there to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, just because Charlie is disabled and because he has challenges---being overwhelmed by sensory stimulation in public places---does not mean that his life has to be limited, that there are things he "never" can do. We don't believe that he has to sit at home and never know all that's out there to do in the world. We're ever seeking to expand the horizon of places he goes to and the experiences he has. (Not sure about Greece, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to Greece is sometimes equated with, indeed, "the good life"---beaches, Mediterranean weather, and other pleasures.   But it's another meaning of "the good life" that's been on my mind and that I've been asking my students to reflect on during the trip and as they read Plato and Aristotle, and in writing an essay about the class. What does it mean, what does it take, to lead a fulfilling --- emotionally, personally, spiritually--- life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how to provide this for Charlie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had known that Charlie would be struggling as he has been since &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;December&lt;/a&gt; when, on vacation in California, he pretty much fell apart, I would never have imagined going on, much less even thinking about, this trip.  January of this year passed fielding calls from the school nurse and by February it was a crisis situation and a hastily scheduled emergency IEP meeting. Slowly and haltingly, things have been &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/on_the_autismfront"&gt;looking up on the docks&lt;/a&gt; and, with everyone at school and at home redoubling their efforts (Charlie's teacher must be singled out for her stellar, generous help).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in a way, this was the right time to travel, the &lt;em&gt;kairos&lt;/em&gt;, the "just moment." Pindar, the choral poet, writes of &lt;em&gt;kairos&lt;/em&gt; as that moment, "the right time," when things come together in due measure. Based on how 2009 started for us, I would be inclined to say, the past week's Greece trip happened at anything but the &lt;em&gt;kairos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I rather suspect that the fact that I went, and that things on the homefront chugged along, suggests the time was right to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; time to head home, back to my very good life with Jim and Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237531594829"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_32.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/368db2f7022c2e64</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">New and Exciting in PLoS this week</title><published>2009-03-20T06:36:09Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T06:36:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/iriw1FA4deU/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_32.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_32.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, let's see what's new in &lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/home.action" title=""&gt;PLoS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/home.action" title=""&gt;PLoS Computational Biology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/home.action" title=""&gt;PLoS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org" title=""&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/a&gt; this week.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004860" title=""&gt;Robust Food Anticipatory Activity in BMAL1-Deficient Mice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Food availability is a potent environmental cue that directs circadian locomotor activity in rodents. Even though nocturnal rodents prefer to forage at night, daytime food anticipatory activity (FAA) is observed prior to short meals presented at a scheduled time of day. Under this restricted feeding regimen, rodents exhibit two distinct bouts of activity, a nocturnal activity rhythm that is entrained to the light-dark cycle and controlled by the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and a daytime bout of activity that is phase-locked to mealtime. FAA also occurs during food deprivation, suggesting that a food-entrainable oscillator (FEO) keeps time in the absence of scheduled feeding. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FEO is anatomically distinct from the SCN and that FAA is observed in mice lacking some circadian genes essential for timekeeping in the SCN. In the current study, we optimized the conditions for examining FAA during restricted feeding and food deprivation in mice lacking functional BMAL1, which is critical for circadian rhythm generation in the SCN. We found that BMAL1-deficient mice displayed FAA during restricted feeding in 12hr light:12hr dark (12L:12D) and 18L:6D lighting cycles, but distinct activity during food deprivation was observed only in 18L:6D. While BMAL1-deficient mice also exhibited robust FAA during restricted feeding in constant darkness, mice were hyperactive during food deprivation so it was not clear that FAA consistently occurred at the time of previously scheduled food availability. Taken together, our findings suggest that optimization of experimental conditions such as photoperiod may be necessary to visualize FAA in genetically modified mice. Furthermore, the expression of FAA may be possible without a circadian oscillator that depends on BMAL1.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004883" title=""&gt;The Generation of Forces and Moments during Visual-Evoked Steering Maneuvers in Flying Drosophila&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sideslip force, longitudinal force, rolling moment, and pitching moment generated by tethered fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, were measured during optomotor reactions within an electronic flight simulator. Forces and torques were acquired by optically measuring the angular deflections of the beam to which the flies were tethered using a laser and a photodiode. Our results indicate that fruit flies actively generate both sideslip and roll in response to a lateral focus of expansion (FOE). The polarity of this behavior was such that the animal's aerodynamic response would carry it away from the expanding pattern, suggesting that it constitutes an avoidance reflex or centering response. Sideslip forces and rolling moments were sinusoidal functions of FOE position, whereas longitudinal force was proportional to the absolute value of the sine of FOE position. Pitching moments remained nearly constant irrespective of stimulus position or strength, with a direction indicating a tonic nose-down pitch under tethered conditions. These experiments expand our understanding of the degrees of freedom that a fruit fly can actually control in flight.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004929" title=""&gt;Producer Nutritional Quality Controls Ecosystem Trophic Structure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Trophic structure, or the distribution of biomass among producers and consumers, determines key ecosystem values, such as the abundance of infectious, harvestable or conservation target species, and the storage and cycling of carbon and nutrients. There has been much debate on what controls ecosystem trophic structure, yet the answer is still elusive. Here we show that the nutritional quality of primary producers controls the trophic structure of ecosystems. By increasing the efficiency of trophic transfer, higher producer nutritional quality results in steeper ecosystem trophic structure, and those changes are more pronounced in terrestrial than in aquatic ecosystems probably due to the more stringent nutritional limitation of terrestrial herbivores. These results explain why ecosystems composed of highly nutritional primary producers feature high consumer productivity, fast energy recycling, and reduced carbon accumulation. Anthropogenic changes in producer nutritional quality, via changes in trophic structure, may alter the values and functions of ecosystems, and those alterations may be more important in terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000322" title=""&gt;Directing Experimental Biology: A Case Study in Mitochondrial Biogenesis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Genome sequencing has provided us with "parts lists" of genes for many organisms, but many of the biological roles these genes are still unknown. While a great deal of functional genomic data exists, providing information about these genes and their roles, the rate at which these data are leveraged into concrete biological knowledge lags far behind the rate of data generation. Many computational approaches have been developed to generate accurate predictions of gene functions, with the goal of bridging this divide. However, as no large-scale experimental efforts have been based on such approaches, their validity and utility remains unproven. We have performed a study that experimentally evaluates predictions from a combination of three computational function prediction approaches, focusing on mitochondrion-related processes in brewer's yeast as a model system. By using computational predictions to guide our laboratory investigation, we have greatly accelerated the rate at which proteins can be assigned to biological processes. Further, our results demonstrate that in order to achieve the best results, it is important for computational biologists to consider both the underlying data and the algorithmic foundations of the methods used to predict function. Lastly, we demonstrate that iterating through phases of prediction and validation has quickly and extensively expanded our knowledge of mitochondrial biology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000320" title=""&gt;On the Growth of Scientific Knowledge: Yeast Biology as a Case Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is of great interest to understand the patterns and mechanisms of scientific knowledge growth, but such studies have been hampered by the lack of ideal cases in which the structure of the knowledge is known, the knowledge is quantifiable, and the process of knowledge discovery is well understood and documented. The biological knowledge about a species is in part described by its protein interaction network and genetic interaction network. Here, we conduct a temporal meta-analysis of three decades of discoveries of protein interactions and genetic interactions in baker's yeast to reveal the tempo and mode of the growth of yeast biology. We show that the growth is exponential over time and that important subjects tend to be studied earlier. However, expansions of different domains of knowledge are highly heterogeneous and episodic such that the temporal turnover of knowledge hubs is much greater than that expected by chance. Familiar subjects are preferentially studied over new subjects, leading to a reduced pace of innovation. While research is increasingly done in teams, the number of discoveries per researcher is greater in smaller teams. These findings reveal collective human behaviors in scientific research and help design better strategies in future knowledge exploration.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000321" title=""&gt;Computational Model of the Insect Pheromone Transduction Cascade&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;All sensory neurons transduce their natural stimulus, whether a molecule, a photon, or a mechanical force, in an electrical current flowing through their sensory membrane via similar molecular and ionic mechanisms. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), whose stimuli are volatile molecules, are no exception, including one of the best known: the exquisitely sensitive ORNs of male moths that detect the sexual pheromone released by conspecific females. We provide a detailed computational model of the intracellular molecular mechanisms at work in this ORN type. We describe qualitatively and quantitatively how the initial event, the interaction of pheromone molecules with specialized receptors at the ORN surface, is amplified through a sequence of linked biochemical and electrical events into a whole cell response, the receptor potential. We detail the respective roles of the upward activating reactions involving a cascade of ionic channels permeable to cations, chloride and potassium, their control by feedback inactivating mechanisms, and the central regulatory role of calcium. This computational model contributes to an integrated understanding of this signalling pathway, provides testable hypotheses, and suggests new experimental approaches.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000314" title=""&gt;Broadband Criticality of Human Brain Network Synchronization&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Systems in a critical state are poised on the cusp of a transition between ordered and random behavior. At this point, they demonstrate complex patterning of fluctuations at all scales of space and time. Criticality is an attractive model for brain dynamics because it optimizes information transfer, storage capacity, and sensitivity to external stimuli in computational models. However, to date there has been little direct experimental evidence for critical dynamics of human brain networks. Here, we considered two measures of functional coupling or phase synchronization between components of a dynamic system: the phase lock interval or duration of synchronization between a specific pair of time series or processes in the system and the lability of global synchronization among all pairs of processes. We confirmed that both synchronization metrics demonstrated scale invariant behaviors in two computational models of critical dynamics as well as in human brain functional systems oscillating at low frequencies (&amp;lt;0.5 Hz, measured using functional MRI) and at higher frequencies (1-125 Hz, measured using magnetoencephalography). We conclude that human brain functional networks demonstrate critical dynamics in all frequency intervals, a phenomenon we have described as broadband criticality.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_32.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/iriw1FA4deU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237529110753"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2586">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/217ddc7bc6ea8d24</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Alternative Medicine"/><category term="Entertainment"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Conan O'Brien"/><category term="Death"/><category term="House"/><category term="Hugh Laurie"/><category term="psychic cat"/><category term="Psychics"/><title type="html">Dr. House debunks Oscar the death cat</title><published>2009-03-20T05:49:18Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T05:49:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/dr-house-debunks-oscar-the-death-cat/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amuseline.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/home_hugh.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.amuseline.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/home_hugh.png" alt="" width="140" height="219"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A while back I remember hearing a family friend describe an unusual news item about a cat at a nursing home that the staff believed correctly predicted that particular patients were about to die. And while I didn’t necessarily know what the true explanation was, I was fairly confident there was a more rational explanation than a psychic death cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=527"&gt;Dr. House solved the mystery of Oscar the death cat at least within the fictional world of the drama series &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It might not be the exact solution to the real life case of the alleged psychic cat, Oscar, but it will hopefully get people thinking about all the possibly simpler explanations that might have explained Oscar’s seemingly psychic abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

At the time, I was a member of the Massachusetts Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners. I’ve previously mentioned that experience &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=115"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that tenure I wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/opposition.rtf"&gt;treatise &lt;/a&gt;on the tenets and practices of ‘naturopathic medicine,’ hoping to change the opinions of several others on the Commission (no such luck). In an early draft I included a section titled “The Political Philosophy of Naturopathy.” My ally on the panel, emeritus &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; Editor Arnold “Bud” Relman, advised me to remove it, citing its tangential relevance and the possibility of it irritating rather than persuading. He was right, of course, but it now seems reasonable to hall it out of the mothballs. Here it is, with minor revisions and, I hope, a provocative postscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;…………………&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
&lt;h3 align="center"&gt; The Political Philosophy of Naturopathy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised, during one of the Commission meetings, to hear a brief discussion implying that the licensing of naturopathic physicians is a ‘liberal’ initiative. The reason for my surprise is two-fold. The first is that liberal politics has, for at least the past one hundred years or so, been associated with exposing the truth (&lt;em&gt;The Nation&lt;/em&gt; advertises itself, with some justification, as a journal for “the most skeptical people”). How likely is it that “naturopathic medicine” could emerge with its pretensions intact after a hardnosed, leftist, investigative report by Jack Anderson or Ralph Nader?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also surprised because the history of naturopathy is anything but liberal. Anti-vaccination and pro-Laetrile forces have been allied for years with other antisocial movements, most notably the far-right anti-fluoridationists. A 1978 study found that organizational participation in the Laetrile movement was strongly associated with “disapproval with fluoridation” and right-wing politics.[1] The modern catch phrase “freedom of choice in health care,” which is echoed in the AANP &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010212035058/http://www.naturopathic.org/position.papers/PP.cancer.html"&gt;position paper on cancer&lt;/a&gt;, was coined by the founders of the pro-Laetrile “&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/cfcm.html"&gt;Committee for Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy&lt;/a&gt;,” every one of whom was a member of the John Birch Society.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion of “vitalism” vs. “mechanism” in the &lt;em&gt;Textbook of Natural Medicine &lt;/em&gt;[2, 3] is infused with the same sort of sectarian zeal that one finds in discussions of “creation science” vs. evolution in other forums. Pat Robertson could use entire paragraphs from that chapter, simply by exchanging those words. The flavor of large portions of naturopathic literature, with its defiantly anti-scientific, anti-intellectual, conspiracy-theory rhetoric, is reminiscent of the far Right. It’s no surprise that the pockets of the country in which naturopaths maintained strongholds prior to the recent “CAM” fad were also strongholds for wacky, anti-government movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early history of naturopathy makes it an even stranger bedfellow for the Left. The most influential naturopath in the U.S. for the first half of the 20th century was the German immigrant Benedict Lust. In 1918 he published his &lt;em&gt;Universal Directory of Naturopathy&lt;/em&gt;, whose introduction is reprinted in the &lt;em&gt;Textbook of Natural Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The document includes several of the ideas that have been discussed here, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[“Allopaths”] have sought to cure disease by the magic of pills and potions and poisons that attacked the ailment with the idea of suppressing the symptoms instead of attacking the real cause of the ailment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical science has always believed in the superstition that the use of chemical substances which are harmful and destructive to human life will prove an efficient substitute for the violation of laws, and in this way encourages the belief that a man may go the limit in self indulgences that weaken and destroy his physical system, and then hope to be absolved from his physical ailments by swallowing a few pills, or submitting to an injection of a serum or vaccine, that are supposed to act as vicarious redeemers of the physical organism and counteract life-long practices that are poisonous and wholly destructive to the patient’s well-being.[2]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the passage is filled with similar fascistic reprimands, excoriating humanity for its immoral behavior—”the real cause of the ailment.” This is not surprising, given the German heritage of every major ‘founding father’ of the field; it’s also not surprising to learn that the Nazis favored “natural healing.”[4]&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That history is not merely of academic interest. Modern naturopathic philosophy persists in this view, even if it has softened somewhat. It can be seen in this passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturopathic physicians contend that most disease is the direct result of the ignorance and violation of what would be called “natural living laws.”[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be seen in the strange, priggish, preoccupation with bowel function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy lifestyle could be generalized to include…the maintaining of proper elimination.[3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is found in the vastly complex “therapies” and Calvinistic lifestyle prescriptions that are so common in the field. One wonders if today’s idealistic graduates of Bastyr University can hear the &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010429082910/http://www.aanp.net/Library/articles.lay/ProstateCancerTK.html"&gt;authoritarian tones&lt;/a&gt; echoing from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;…the patient must… make a total commitment to their [sic] health and well being in order for the treatment to ultimately be successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest school of naturopathy is the &lt;a href="http://www.bridgeport.edu/pages/1.asp"&gt;University of Bridgeport&lt;/a&gt; College of Naturopathic Medicine. It boasts that it is the only one affiliated with a “real” university. But this is no ordinary university. It is the flagship of the &lt;a href="http://www.wufed.org/"&gt;World University Federation&lt;/a&gt;, a front organization for the Unification Church. Recall that this is the cult of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, from whose name its more common designation, the “Moonies,” is derived. Rev. Moon is famous for his bizarre, right wing, megalomaniacal eruptions, including &lt;a href="http://www.rickross.com/reference/unif/Unif23.html"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, as individuals and families you have to absolutely follow True Parents (Mr. and Mrs. Moon). Your opinion cannot stand against TrueParents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must understand what I have in mind and take my commands as strict orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say there are 500 sons and daughters like you in each state. Then we could control the government….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time will come, without my seeking it, that my words will almost sense as law. If I ask a certain thing, it will be done. If I don’t want something, it will not be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true sovereign is not the American president nor the English king, but the Lord of the Second Advent (that is, Rev. Moon)…Americans must listen to me and follow me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did naturopathy ever become affiliated with the American Left? I can only imagine that this sprang from the Sixties and the essential lapse of critical thinking, especially among young people, that accompanied the social upheavals of the time, laudable and not so laudable. I was a college student in the early 1970s, and can easily recall the intellectual laissez-faire that was encouraged, even required of otherwise intelligent people—including students who, only a few years previously, had been expected to learn the tools of critical thinking as part of their college educations. Thus “other ways of knowing” and “differing paradigms” (a mangling of the writings of Thomas Kuhn) had suddenly become &lt;em&gt;de rigueur&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there really is knowledge. Streptococcal pharyngitis is dangerous, and so far we really have only one sure way to reduce the danger. Heavy metal toxicity is rare, as are food allergies and chronic yeast infections. Sugar in the diet doesn’t have anything to do with ear infections. Childhood immunizations really do, dramatically and safely, prevent terrible diseases. An acute asthma attack needs to be treated with a bronchodilator. Goldenseal doesn’t act, in any significant clinical way, as an antibiotic. And so on. There aren’t, when it comes to safety and efficacy in medicine, “other ways of knowing.” So far, the only way humanity has found to understand the objective world is through scientific research, and the knowledge gained through science is cumulative, even if at some level it remains tentative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman"&gt;……………….&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn’t attempt to embarrass the liberal, ND-advocating politicians on the Commission with this material, I doubt that I could have done that. Even at the time I wasn’t so naive as to predict otherwise; I was more interested in exposing their hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since writing that piece I’ve found additional, tortured ‘integrations’ of classical, fascistic hectoring with kinder, gentler approaches to naturopathic ministrations. An example is a &lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0ISW/is_2003_Feb-March/ai_97994361"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; written by a student at the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine in Tempe, Arizona; while mostly touchy-feely, it also includes this (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Act in Cooperation with the Healing Powers of Nature; Address the Fundamental Cause of Disease&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counseling relationship begins with a reverence for life, the purpose of life and what it means to be human. &lt;strong&gt;The architect of the human has created a complex design&lt;/strong&gt; consisting of emotional, psychological and spiritual components that manifest the fear of the unknown… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When disease is viewed as the enemy, randomly striking, then the doctor performs heroic acts on the sick individual who has taken on the role of the powerless victim. In contrast, &lt;strong&gt;when disease is viewed as a lesson, never random&lt;/strong&gt;, ideally the doctor takes on the role of teacher and mentor, and the patient becomes an active participant in the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sectarian” is the term favored by Dr. Sampson. He is, obviously, correct. Those who favor separation of church and state might wonder why the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine administers a &lt;a href="http://www.cnme.org/faq.html"&gt;Loan Repayment Program&lt;/a&gt; for students and grads of “accredited” naturopathic schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;………………….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* &lt;/strong&gt;In Nazi Germany there were striking parallels to current “CAM” politics in the United States. Ref. 4 below, which is available &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hogbxS2Gp1QC&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PA223&amp;amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;amp;cad=0_0"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrates several:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;More Goethe, Less Newton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kötschau’s demands were sweeping: the thrust of the Nazi revolution must be to replace the mechanistic thinking of recent medicine by a new and more organic (biologische), holistic view of the world. It was not enough…for surgery to make techical advances; indeed, the primacy of technical or mechanistic thinking had stifled the search for alternative methods and made difficult the preservation of valuable traditional therapies. Natural methods of healing (Naturheilkunde) had as a result been replaced by exclusively physicochemical models and techniques; time-tested methods such as homeopathy had been supplanted by modern pharmacology and mass-produced chemical products. Kötschau complained that two, separate sciences had developed: one for the laboratory and one for the bedside. Science had become ’separate from the people.’ Kötschau called for a new philosophy of medicine, a philosophy that would reorient medicine toward ‘more Goethe, and less Newton.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=68"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt;? Other choice quotations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural medicine was not something…invented by the Nazis. New in the Nazi period was the government’s apparent willingness to revive and regulate certain of these traditions and to place them on a par with other forms of medical practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural health movement enjoyed support from the highest levels of Nazi leadership [Hitler, Hess, Himmler].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic medicine, [Gerald Wagner of the Nazi League of Physicians] charged, used complicated methods to diagnose problems in particular parts of the body, while ignoring the person as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under National Socialism…natural methods…would have to be regulated so that ‘anyone who wants treatment by a natural healer can rest assured that the healer has been adequately trained in the art of his trade.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=380"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt;? More:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A broad reorientation of German medicine…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic care stations were being planned for Munich and Dresden…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of a Committee for a New German Science of Healing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the establishment of professorships in the New German Science of Healing at German universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent of the congress…was ‘to bridge the gap that separates academic medicine from the feelings and desires of the people.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Alfred Schwenkenbecher of Marburg, in his opening speech before the congress, hailed an era of new thinking in medicine, characterized by ‘a retreat from purely scientific attitudes.’ German medicine had come to a crisis, or turning point, from which would come a new kind of medicine, one ‘closer to the people’ and dealing with ‘the wholeness of the human personality.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…physicians must become both ‘allopaths’ and ‘homeopaths’…in the future there must be no difference between school medicine and organic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…if something is good for the Volk, it doesn’t matter where it comes from—whether that be the university professor, or the herbalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…the purpose of preventive care was to strengthen the organism so that it can fight illness on its own…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kötschau argue that the goal of the New German Science of Healing was not to eliminate curative healing but to render it unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=399"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt;? The Weisbaden Congress of 1936, where much of that language had been used,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;concluded by issuing a resolution that German medical science had won its worldwide reputation by virtue of its love of truth and its exacting research standards; the congress resolved to test the methods of natural healing using these same strict and unbiased standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=349"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=356"&gt;more so&lt;/a&gt;? It was a Golden Age of ‘integrative medicine’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years following the 1935 and 1936 Nuremberg and Weisbaden meetings, natural healing enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.unisci.com/stories/20013/0821016.htm"&gt;unprecedented status&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. The government established homeopathic &lt;a href="http://www.osher.ucsf.edu/patient/index.html"&gt;hospitals &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/"&gt;funded popular lectures&lt;/a&gt; and exhibits on organic medicine. Several journals &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=247"&gt;of the movement&lt;/a&gt; expanded publication. Natural medicine was for the first time in many years &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=72"&gt;taught &lt;/a&gt;in German universities; plans were made to establish a number of &lt;a href="http://www.osher.ucsf.edu/bios/abrams.html"&gt;professorships &lt;/a&gt;in this area. Orthodox &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=210"&gt;medical journals&lt;/a&gt; reported on the value of natural healing for internal medicine, pharmacy, and surgery; in 1936 Berlin’s Academy for Postgraduate Medical Education offered &lt;a href="http://cme.med.harvard.edu/index.asp?SECTION=CLASSES&amp;amp;ID=00292317"&gt;courses &lt;/a&gt;on homeopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

by Frederick Grinnell&lt;br&gt;
Oxford University Press&lt;br&gt;
2009&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists are not usually shy when it comes to voicing their frustration about the public's understanding of how science works, or about the deficits in that understanding.  Some lay this at the feet of an educational system that makes it too easy for students to opt out of science coursework, while others blame the dearth of science coverage in our mass media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than casting about for a villain, cell biologist Frederick Grinnell has written a book that aims to help the non-scientist understand what scientific practice looks -- and feels -- like to the scientists.  This description of scientific activity connects the dry textbook accounts of scientific method to the vibrant, messy, frustrating yet invigorating terrain scientists inhabit as they try to build new knowledge.  Grinnell's book also connects the scientists' world to the vibrant, messy, frustrating yet invigorating world they share with non-scientists as he considers ethical and societal dimensions of scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the low, low price of $3.95 a month, they will run your prayer of choice through a voice synthesizer every day, and allow the computer to speak to god &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;.

They’re having their gallbladders tapped for bile to be used in “traditional” medicine. Thirteen of them, though sick and traumatized, have been rescued. But many more aren’t so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 7,000-10,000 moon bears, so-called for the pale crescent across their chests, still languish in bile farms across China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are victims of a brutal trade that, despite some successes by activists, persists in a country where respect for animal welfare is low and a sizable market for the bile remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, blog bud Abel Pharmboy posted a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/03/complementary_and_alternative.php?utm_source=networkbanner&amp;amp;utm_medium=link"&gt;very good explanation on why&lt;/a&gt;. Money quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;CAM is a terrible term. It is NOT medicine. Modalities proven to work are medicine. Modalities that don't work are not medicine. There is no complement to medicine. Medicine is medicine. There is no integrative medicine, either. Medicine already takes advantage of all modalities: surgical, pharmacological, radiological, physical, psychological, nutritional - if a clear benefit can be offered to a patient that outweighs the risk.

&lt;p&gt;So-called integrative medicine gurus have adopted proven, preventive medicine techniques - diet, exercise, meditation, yoga - and have used them 1) to justify that "CAM" works and 2) that the efficacy of these approaches justifies study and implementation of approaches that have absolutely no scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly what I've been saying all along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/complementary_and_alternative_medicine_n.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/2kGRfUSYxbE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237524665788"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2576">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/841cf618959edd43</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><category term="photography"/><category term="space"/><category term="stratosphere"/><category term="weather balloon"/><title type="html">Teens capture images of space with £56 camera &amp;amp; balloon</title><published>2009-03-20T04:50:41Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T04:50:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/19/teens-capture-images-of-space-with-56-camera-balloon/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01367/space_1367605c.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01367/space_1367605c.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="219"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is a pretty awesome story. &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5005022/Teens-capture-images-of-space-with-56-camera-and-balloon.html"&gt;Four Spanish students successfully launched a camera-operated    weather balloon into the stratosphere&lt;/a&gt; and got photos.&lt;/p&gt;

What that means to most people is that it’s the first day of spring (or fall in the southern hemisphere), &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/badseasons.html"&gt;but they’re wrong&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it means in real life is that there is very roughly equal amounts of daytime and nighttime (the word equinox means &amp;quot;equal night&amp;quot;); it’s not exact due to &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~oliver/ast3722/lectures/EffectOfAtmosphere/EffectAtmos.htm"&gt;the Earth’s atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s neither here nor there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For astronomers, it means the center of the Sun has 0° declination, and &lt;a href="http://www.astronomynotes.com/nakedeye/s5.htm"&gt;it crosses from the southern celestial hemisphere into the northern one&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For NASA, it means &lt;a href="http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2009/index.php"&gt;they can celebrate Sun-Earth day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for some people, it means it’s the only time they can stand an egg on its end. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrhdR0G2PQ0"&gt;They’re wrong too&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/03/undersea_eruptions_near_tonga.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/tonga_kaboom.jpg" alt="Tonga eruption"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon an earthquake in the region triggered a brief tsunami warning that blew over. It may very well be that a small tremor a few days ago is what triggered this eruption, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you ever wonder just how much energy is involved even in a small blast, consider this: the plume of ash and rock goes up several hundred meters. OK, go outside and find a rock that masses about 10 kilos. Now climb a flight of steps with it and see how tired you get. Now imagine climbing 100 flights of stairs with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine doing that with, say, a &lt;strong&gt;million&lt;/strong&gt; of those rocks. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; how much energy it takes to blast the plume into the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never misunderestimate planet Earth. There’s a lot of energy just sitting there under our feet, and sometimes it struggles free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237513029366"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-7230033649883089586">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fe0c8f5fb82f0c9d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Blame It On The Shame...Yeaaah Yeah...</title><published>2009-03-20T00:55:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-20T00:55:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2009/03/blame-it-on-shameyeaaah-yeah.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Remember Milli Vanilli?  Yeah, those two guys who had an album or two with some hit songs back in the day, then got outed as fakeass lip-sync douches.  They gave their Grammy(s?) back, lost all of their sizeable fan base, fell into obscurity, one killed himself and the other is still fucking around in shit nightclubs trying to remake his image and career.  Anyone asked would likely say, &lt;i&gt;"Oh yeah, I remember them.  I used to like them until they got caught faking."&lt;/i&gt; Then there'd be that weird moment where the guy tries to talk but have his lips not match the words and you'd do that awkward not-laugh thing and then silence would come....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok, so what about the Catholic church?  It used to be in a position of power, few questioned its authority, but then you found out that nice Father Patrick who gave you your marriage classes and taught you about relationships - regardless of the fact that the fucking guy barely even talked to women his entire life - got caught balls deep in the neck of an eight-year old.  Then the Bishop moved him to another parish so he could ass-rape and mentally destroy seven other pre-teens while being fully aware that Patrick was a pedophile.  This isn't an isolated incident and you are now cognizant of that fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the fucking pope goes to Angola where they've been (thankfully?) somewhat spared from the 20% AIDS infection rate of countries like neighboring Namibia by a 27-year civil war, &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt; there is still rampant poverty, a 16% AIDS infection rate in the south, AND two-thirds of women give birth before age twenty*.  What genocidally stupid thing does the goddamn pope say?  &lt;i&gt;"Condoms won't help the AIDS crisis...they'll make it worse."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After this, how can anyone out there look at themselves in a mirror and say that they're a Catholic?  You should be somewhere in the range of infinitely more embarrassed than a still passionate Milli Vanilli fan.  Fuck, I'd blow the still-living guy rather than join back with the Catholics.

&lt;p&gt;Back then I was more active as a moderator on the forums and had to deal with all those threads and merge them as they came.  In the end I just gave it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That story was about Oscar, the cat.  Oscar isn’t your normal cat, oh no, he is a resident of a nursing home in Providence, RI.  What made Oscar so intertesting was the claims made by doctors and nurses who worked for the nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/4I0nCNwGQ0Q%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, Oscar could predict who would be the next resident to die.  He would do this by lying down next a resident in their last few hours.  It is claimed that he was so accurate, in fact, that the nursing staff actually called up the residents’ family to notify them that they were in their final hours. Imagine that phone call:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family: “Hello?”&lt;br&gt;
Nurse: “Yes, this is nurse so-and-so from the nursing home.  We believe your loved one is about to pass away.”&lt;br&gt;
Family: “Oh? What’s going on?”&lt;br&gt;
Nurse: “Well it’s Oscar, he’s lying next to your loved one.”&lt;br&gt;
Family: “Oscar?”&lt;br&gt;
Nurse: “Our cat, he can tell when someone’s about to die.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the hell do you say to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, like all of these “fluff” news items, it went away.  But the cat, as they say, has come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night the most recent episode of House dealt with just that.  A nurse who believed she was going to die because the cat from her nursing home was lying next to her a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t continue reading if you don’t want it spoiled.  SPOILERS AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House, being House, called her an idiot, but took the case anyway because he thought he could prove her wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly thought they’d end up with the cat causing some sort of rare disease.  And House, in his typical “moment of clarity”, solves the case.  But they actually made it better.  Using, as House put it, “logic, science and reason” (and of course the patented House moment of clarity) he concluded that the cat was drawn to heat sources, and the people who were about to die in the nursing home usually had either a fever or an electric blanket.  I’ve seen my cat plop his fat behind on our heat vents and hog our heat enough times to say that this is plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always loved the show House.  He’s dealt with interesting topics such as religion, God, faith healers, superstitions, the afterlife and now death cats.  And the show never ends with a “oh, maybe that IS possible” vibe.  It’s a refreshing change to the other crap that’s on TV right now.  But it seems that ever so slowly, the networks are getting it.  Maybe I don’t watch as much TV as I used to, but I find that there are far fewer paranormal-type shows on TV these days and just a little more reality-based shows such as House and the Mentalist.  Not that they are without their flaws, but they’re no “Medium”s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, in my ideal future, I’ll be sitting in front my TV with a bowl of popcorn in hand watching the intro to the most popular show on TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black screen… ext. dark starry sky.. cue familiar bass line.  “You’re listening to the Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe……”&lt;/p&gt;

People on the spectrum were extra-encouraged to attend by &lt;a href="http://www.oregonautism.com/"&gt;ASO&lt;/a&gt;, which provided scholarships to get around the whole "autistic people typically don't have a spare hundred + dollars" barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's amusing that a workshop that invites autistic people, discusses topics such as "Workplace Supports," and advises to give extra processing time (on a slide) hasn't done much in the way of structuring its program to take its own advice.  The event is a two-day non-stop barrage of information in a bright, noisy conference setting which includes "activities" that may not be possible for all "students" (at least they are not possible for me).  Worse, the language on slides refers to autistic people as "our clients;" this language is explicitly excluding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one concrete example of a much broader issue: if organizers want to encourage participation by autistic individuals in workshops or conferences, they need to do more than just invite us.  The workshop or conference itself needs to be autistic-friendly in terms of how it's scheduled, how it's structured, and how sensory issues are accommodated.  It also needs to include us as meaningful participants in the way it presents information, including in the language used to address the audience.  Inclusion means more than filling a chair.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237503772159"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/19/thats-my-pie/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d3216c5fbdcded92</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">That’s *my* pie</title><published>2009-03-19T23:00:26Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T23:00:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/19/thats-my-pie/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Personally, I thought they were like twelve states away from each other, but the online paper &lt;a href="http://thephoenix.com/Boston/Life/78548-Not-so-sure-guys/"&gt;The Boston Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; has a nice article about Pi Day (March 14, natch) and how it was celebrated by skepticism and pie-throwing… and who is that we see on the front page?

The first line is often a legal chill - silence dissent by threatening libel. The list grows almost daily with &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/02/is-there-proper-media-lawyer-in-house.html"&gt;Jeni Barnett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/09/no-more-rath-sewage.html"&gt;Matthias Rath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2007/10/be-shamed-society-of-homeopaths.html"&gt;Society of Homeopaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/06/bullies-backfire-when-bloggers-attack/"&gt;Ann Walker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/08/another-back-cracking-quack-attack_18.html"&gt;British Chiropractic Association&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/derek-draper-dishonest-spin-quack/"&gt;Derek Draper&lt;/a&gt; using draconian British libel laws to avoid having to answer their critics. In the majority of cases, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect"&gt;The Streisand Effect&lt;/a&gt; has ensured that thousands more people were made aware of the criticism than would ever had heard about had the person not gone running to mummy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps it's a sign of the times, perhaps the Quackery (CAM) industry has realised that legal threats are counterproductive. This week had two examples of an alternative Alternative response, which were suitably hand-wavy and free of substance, much like the pills and tinctures they purvey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, the Society of Homeopaths woke from a daze - they haven&amp;#39;t put out a press release since last November (no doubt their members are thrilled the fees have been put to such hard work). In response to a piece in Private Eye about Jeremy Sherr, they have put all of their talents together, diluted &amp;amp; succussed them to 30c and produced &lt;a href="http://www.homeopathy-soh.org/whats-new/press-releases.aspx"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. For anybody who wants to know the full &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/search?q=sherr"&gt;Jeremy "I'm trying to cure AIDS with homeopathy" Sherr&lt;/a&gt; story, enjoy the ride at &lt;a href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?s=sherr"&gt;Gimpy's Blog&lt;/a&gt;. He has also blogged a tremendous fisk of the SoH response to the Private Eye note &lt;a href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/society-of-homeopaths-respond-on-sherr-dishonestly/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For the purposes of this blogpost, the salient points are that the SoH made a statement that contained untruths, disingenuous statements and weasel words - the evidence of this is clear in Gimpy's Post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second similar statement came from business arm of our Royal Quackpot, Prince Charles' Duchy Originals in response to &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7934568.stm"&gt;criticism from Professor Edzard Ernst&lt;/a&gt; from the Peninsula Medical School. This isn't the first time that Charlie and Eddy have had a set-to. Prof Ernst has &lt;a href="http://dcscience.net/?p=89"&gt;spoken out about the Prince's quackery&lt;/a&gt; before, which resulted in Clarence House complaining to the Vice-Chancellor, seemingly suggesting it might be suitable to sack the Prof. How very sporting, what, what?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, Prof Ernst has stated that the Duchy Herbals Detox Tincture which contains globe artichoke and dandelion has no efficacy in 'detoxing' (whatever the hell that word means) and is a pretty pill for the middle class worried well, who perhaps like to think that overindulgence can be cured that way. (Edit: See &lt;a href="http://cargo-cult-science.blogspot.com/2009/03/duchy-originals-tinctures-never.html"&gt;Cargo Cult Science&lt;/a&gt; for a similar takedown)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.duchyoriginals.com/post.php/News/288"&gt;The response is brilliant&lt;/a&gt; in its hand-waving, untruths, disingenuous statements and weasel words (where have I heard that before?) - ah yes, three paragraphs ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Following recent press articles regarding our Duchy Herbals range, we are aware that some of our customers may be seeking reassurance about the range.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our CEO, Andrew Baker, says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;'Together with our partners, Nelsons - leaders in the field of natural medicine, we spent many years researching and developing our first range of herbal tinctures. It is a range that we are truly proud of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, they probably are seeking 'reassurance' - they don't really like being told that they are fools easily partable with their money. Even though they are. I have spent many years researching and developing a range of Dr*T's herbal tinctures. Like the Duchy's, they don't work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Our Duchy Herbals Echina-Relief Tincture and Duchy Herbals Hyperi-lift Tincture have both been approved and licensed as traditional herbal medicines by the UK regulatory authorities, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br&gt;Come on, 'fess up, Mr Baker. You and I both know that MHRA approval does not give any indication as to effectiveness. The MHRA never make any claims as to a products efficacy, just that it is safe to use and has been well manufactured and won't kill you. But you wouldn't be trying to hide that fact, would you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Our Duchy Herbals Detox Tincture, which is traded as a food supplement, has been produced to the highest quality standards and within the regulatory framework of both UK and European food law&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ah, a 'food supplement' - I am confused. Why are making medicine-like claims but you sell it as a 'food supplement'? Anything to do with trying your very best to imply it is a medicine, but not making any bold claims, because it doesn't work? I have no doubt it's extremely high quality snakeoil, but it remains snakeoil. (In any case, I still &lt;a href="http://www.duchyoriginals.com/detox_tincture.php"&gt;don't understand&lt;/a&gt; what "eliminating toxins" means, or indeed "aiding digestion".)&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;I do hope, therefore, that you are able to share our confidence in the compliance of the Duchy Herbals range to the very highest regulatory standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Well, I do. This product is very high quality, well-made, and completely benign quackery. This sums up the Duchy's attempt to reassure their customer chumps - the criticism was to say that the product is make-believe nonsense, the response is not to deny that, but to assert that it is quality make-believe nonsense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outside of the statement, the Telegraph &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/4967749/Prince-Charles-is-exploiting-the-gullible-with-dodgy-detox-remedy-scientist-argues.html"&gt;has quoted&lt;/a&gt; a Duchy Originals' (or Dodgy Originals as Prof E likes to call them) spokesperson as saying:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not – and has never been described as – a medicine, remedy or cure for any disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Compare with the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=47566662430&amp;amp;ref=mf"&gt;Dodgy Originals Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page: &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Each of our tinctures provides an alternative and natural way of treating common ailments such as colds and flu.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is place on the Duchy's website to write a comment - despite a number of &lt;a href="http://badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=8171&amp;amp;st=0&amp;amp;sk=t&amp;amp;sd=a&amp;amp;start=60"&gt;Bad Sciencers&lt;/a&gt; leaving their thoughts, the Duchy has not deemed it suitable to print them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That does not deserve a response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;With thanks to Tristan and stvb2170 on Bad Science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-8417536015144045503?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237497487432"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_ed_stimulus_will_it_really_help">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff393c080213aebb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Special Ed Stimulus: Will It Really Help?</title><published>2009-03-19T21:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T21:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_ed_stimulus_will_it_really_help" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Classroom photo by perspicacious" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/303144538_77cafcdd00_m.jpg" height="180" alt="Classroom photo by perspicacious" width="240"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tonight I'm meeting Marilena, a mom like me, and a friend &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;in Athens&lt;/a&gt; and I'm very excited. My students and I are flying back to the US Friday morning and the trip has been wonderful wonderful. It is time to go home and, having spoken briefly to our tour guide about autism and services in Greece, I've been thinking about how things are back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly Charlie's teacher and school program have played a huge role in &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/preparing_for_when_im_not_there"&gt;making it possible for me to be gone&lt;/a&gt;. My school district has been making budget cuts that have meant a freeze on hiring and some of the more recently hired teachers in the district are being let go of. So far Charlie's program is ok and I've been wondering how the President's &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/how_much_will_your_school_district_receive_under_the_stimulus_plan"&gt;stimulus plan&lt;/a&gt; may effect special special education in our district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christina Samuels in the March 16th &lt;a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2009/03/18/25idea_ep.h28.html?tkn=ZQ%5BFB5nm69gQAvsPAMtIksDGFQ4IBtb9mL0F"&gt;Education Week&lt;/a&gt; writes that, while school districts are certainly welcoming funds ($6.1 billion this year and the same total to come next year) from the stimulus plan, many are sounding a note of caution about the funds, due to restrictions on how these can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though grateful for the largess, school leaders face restrictions with that money. The rules governing the use of federal special education money mean that it’s unwise for districts to use the added funding to start new programs or hire new teachers. If they were to do so, districts would have to continue to pay for those costs in two years, when the federal infusion goes away, under a provision in the IDEA that requires districts to avoid making large cuts in programs from year to year.&lt;br&gt;
.........&lt;br&gt;
The IDEA allows some flexibility in spending federal aid. Every federal special education dollar must be spent on special education, but the law allows districts to reduce their local contribution to special education when they receive an increase in federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That flexibility means that Judith Johnson, the superintendent of the 3,000-student Peekskill, N.Y., district, will be able to use stimulus money to preserve about five teaching positions in next year’s proposed budget. However, the stimulus measure didn’t prevent the district from sending layoff notifications last week to some 50 staff members, including teachers, clerical employees, and custodians. The employees who may end up being laid off at the end of this school year represent about 10 percent of the district’s staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael P. Benway,  the superintendent of Valparaiso, Indiana, is planning to use funds to train paraprofessionals and to "[strengthen] the district’s response-to-intervention program," but not to start new programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring and retaining teachers, paraprofessionals, other therapists, and other personnel seems to me to be a #1 priority.  I'm hopeful that the stimulus plan is not promising more than it can deliver and that it does not just provide short-term help for long-term needs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237497483224"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/todays_carnivals_348.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ccaf8fc1c8fdfd6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnivals"/><title type="html">Today's carnivals</title><published>2009-03-19T19:43:05Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T19:43:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/TuiupVCYuvU/todays_carnivals_348.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/todays_carnivals_348.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I and the Bird #96 is up on &lt;a href="http://birdchaser.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-and-bird-96.html" title=""&gt;The Birdchaser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One is the NASA Spaceflight site. &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html"&gt;Start here&lt;/a&gt;, put in your country, then keep following the directions. You’ll get to a table of current and future times the Shuttle and ISS will pass in your local sky, including elevation and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually found that site a bit difficult to read (for example, one pass for me is listed as being at 08:47 p.m., which is a confusing way to phrase it). So I actually recommend you go to one of my all-time favorite sites on the web, &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;Heavens Above&lt;/a&gt;. Enter your latitude and longitude (you can get those from any number of sources, including Google maps), and away you go. You can find out when all manner of satellites are visible from your location, and even get sky maps to help you spot them. It’s a phenomenal website, and the first one I go to when I know I’ll be out at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to diss the NASA site, of course. They do have a very nifty map showing &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/index.html"&gt;the real-time location of ISS right now&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty slick. You can also use &lt;a href="http://www.n2yo.com/?s=25544"&gt;the N2YPO site&lt;/a&gt; that has real-time maps of where a ton of satellites are, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237495945964"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6420">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/80ff9cc6b9650a59</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Chat"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Parenting"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 3.19</title><published>2009-03-19T19:00:05Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T19:00:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6420" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, a federal appeals court &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5imQG80YMezF1XffdAYD-tNESqClgD96VB0MO0"&gt;upheld a Texas law&lt;/a&gt; that requires public school students to observe a daily minute of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language of the law that was contested by a small group of Dallas area parents states that the minute is meant to allow students to “reflect, pray, meditate, or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents claim the law “does harm” to their children, and they maintain that including the word “pray” in the mandatory moment of silence is a way for lawmakers to advance religion in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you agree with the court’s finding that the law is contitutional, or do you side with the parents bringing the suit? Do you see any benefits to having a minute of silence each morning in public schools? Any drawbacks?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237495945964"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6500">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b6921f27c41fefc4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Links elsewhere"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><title type="html">New Bostonist: The Boston Globe Mixes Science &amp;amp; Religion</title><published>2009-03-19T18:34:20Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T18:34:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6500" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Boston Globe has discontinued its weekly Science &amp;amp; Health section.

The challenge was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge for the seven surviving candidates is to write a short comment, 200 words or less, that reveals that they actually understand why their attitudes and pattern of expression have so exasperated readers here, and explains what they will do to change their behavior in the future. This will be a tough one for this crowd, I'm sure. Let's see if they can wake up enough to do some honest self-assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this challenge isn't to force people to change or defend their ideas, of course, but to see whether they can honestly recognize why &lt;i&gt;other people&lt;/i&gt; might find them so irritating that they are asking me to ban them. So your job in the comments here is to tell me who you think did the best job of actually being briefly self-aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the attempts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1481804"&gt;Africangenesis&lt;/a&gt;, who explains that far left progressives don't like being shown to be shallow, destructive, and vindictive by someone who is more comfortable with himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1481897"&gt;John Kwok&lt;/a&gt; apologizes for name-dropping and talking about his high school…and then tells us that he should be talking about it. And then he tells us about his high school &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1482035"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1482102"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1482131"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1482230"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; and

&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1482255"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;. And makes a new &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1482197"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1481948"&gt;Pete Rooke&lt;/a&gt; talks at length about beliefs. You tell me if he makes it, because I couldn't read it all without nodding off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#comment-1484668"&gt;Facilis&lt;/a&gt; has one that I missed first time through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/piPerspective.php?page=piPerspective_3_19_2009"&gt;Alan Stern’s New Horizons page&lt;/a&gt;, he tells us that the Pluto probe has something of a milestone today: it’s 1/3 of the way to Pluto in time. In other words, it’s been 1155 days since launch on January 19, 2006, and New Horizons will pass Pluto on July 14, 2015, which will be 3463 days after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, it passed 1/3 of the distance it will travel to Pluto some time ago! The probe was moving fastest right after launch, but has since been decelerating due to gravity from the Sun (and initially from the Earth) [Note added later: This is not quite correct; I forgot initially that the probe picked up speed at Jupiter, so in fact it’s been slowing down ever since &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;]. It’s moving more slowly now, so it takes longer to hit each distance milestone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan makes a remarkable comment on that page: besides the spent booster that put the probe on its course to Pluto, &lt;em&gt;there are no man-made objects within a billion miles of New Horizons.&lt;/em&gt; Space is empty, dark, and deep in the outer solar system. But only for a few more years… and then the little probe will pass Pluto, and have plenty of things to do and see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237489155063"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-6049541034348251688">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/238b8b93b4e5a5ec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Journalism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Science Journalism in Decline</title><published>2009-03-19T18:06:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T20:32:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/science-journalism-in-decline.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/6049541034348251688/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=6049541034348251688" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> There&amp;#39;s an editorial in Nature this week on science journalism [Filling the Void].

To visit &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/" title=""&gt;Dr.Isis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? To help an Undergraduate win a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2009/03/help_dr_isis_fund_an_award_for.php" title=""&gt;science scholarship&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The APS has very kindly agreed to allow us (hang tight, I'm not asking for money, seriously) to fund an award at this year's Experimental Biology meeting for the undergraduate woman who submits the best abstract.  Each year the APS awards seven David Bruce Awards for undergraduate research excellence and, within the structure of this program, the APS will be adding an eighth award specifically from me and my lovely readers (but I'm not asking for money.  I promise).  I really loved the idea of using my blog to encourage and reward a more junior scientist who had done excellent work and visiting these undergraduate poster presentations are really a highlight for me each year.  So how can you help?

&lt;p&gt;It's no secret that us ScienceBloggers are paid for our drivel.  Right now I make about enough in a month to cover the cost of my internet connection.  In order to fund the award, I have agreed to donate to the APS the proceeds from my blogging shenanigans over the next 30 days.  The APS has very generously agreed to provide matching funds up to a final award amount of $500.  My current traffic is not sufficient to completely fund the award....but it could be if I about doubled my traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it's really quite simple.  I am asking you to help reward an undergraduate scientist for research excellence by clicking on my blog and asking others to click too.  If you click once a day, come by twice a day.  Each time you do, the proceeds generated will go to fund this award. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then do what?  Just go there, as often as you can remember. And send others. Clicks, visits, pageviews....more of that, more money for the kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just do it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/03/mit-adopts-university-wide-oa-mandate.html" title=""&gt;Peter Suber reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is committed to disseminating the fruits of its research and scholarship as widely as possible. In keeping with that commitment, the Faculty adopts the following policy: Each Faculty member grants to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology nonexclusive permission to make available his or her scholarly articles and to exercise the copyright in those articles for the purpose of open dissemination. In legal terms, each Faculty member grants to MIT a nonexclusive, irrevocable, paid-up, worldwide license to exercise any and all rights under copyright relating to each of his or her scholarly articles, in any medium, provided that the articles are not sold for a profit, and to authorize others to do the same. The policy will apply to all scholarly articles written while the person is a member of the Faculty except for any articles completed before the adoption of this policy and any articles for which the Faculty member entered into an incompatible licensing or assignment agreement before the adoption of this policy. The Provost or Provost's designate will waive application of the policy for a particular article upon written notification by the author, who informs MIT of the reason.

&lt;p&gt;To assist the Institute in distributing the scholarly articles, as of the date of publication, each Faculty member will make available an electronic copy of his or her final version of the article at no charge to a designated representative of the Provost's Office in appropriate formats (such as PDF) specified by the Provost's Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Provost's Office will make the scholarly article available to the public in an open- access repository. The Office of the Provost, in consultation with the Faculty Committee on the Library System will be responsible for interpreting this policy, resolving disputes concerning its interpretation and application, and recommending changes to the Faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy is to take effect immediately; it will be reviewed after five years by the Faculty Policy Committee, with a report presented to the Faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Faculty calls upon the Faculty Committee on the Library System to develop and monitor a plan for a service or mechanism that would render compliance with the policy as convenient for the faculty as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Instead, it frequently goes “muttermuttermutter@!$%&amp;amp;*mutter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about science is that, well, when you’re trying to figure out something new, no one can tell you the answer.  There’s no hint in the back of the book, or 24-hour help line.  So, if you get stuck, you may well find yourself in the scientific equivalent of a lonely mountain road with a broken axle.  And no cell service.  In essence, you’ve broken down in a place no one wants to go to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unless you’re ready to call it quits, you somehow have to find your way out.  You don’t know how long it’s going to take, or how you’re going to make it, but somehow, you’re going to find your way back to the main road.  So, you keep hurling yourself at the problem, trying every &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver"&gt;MacGyver&lt;/a&gt; trick in your arsenal, hoping that something, anything, will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about these periods is that while they’re about the single most frustrating and unrewarding part of the scientific process, they are also a ridiculously effective way to develop new skills.  By the time you’ve tried &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs?bibcode=1990ApJ...364..104I&amp;amp;"&gt;5 different methods of fitting a straight line&lt;/a&gt; to some data points, you’ve picked up a heck of a lot about statistics (or, in my case, about solving a network of partial differential equations where the time dependence of three quantities depends on the spatial variation of 1 or more of the others.  Ick.).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that as you get older, you spend less and less time in such states, because you’ve got an enormous swiss army knife of tools that you carry around in your back pocket.  (”Hmmm, broken axle?  I recognize that particular brand of axle from &lt;a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~cbm/aands/frameindex.htm"&gt;Abromowitz &amp;amp; Stegun&lt;/a&gt;, and I believe I might happen to have some IDL code right here that can fix it…”) The bad news is that you can forget how much those periods, well, suck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Unsolicited but Related Advice for Junior Scientists: When giving talks, avoid dwelling on the Doldrums, even if you spent 90% of the project drifting around them.  Focus on the science, even if it was only a small fraction of your research effort.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of us here on Earth who blog about space, but as far as I know, there’s only one person in space who blogs about Earth: &lt;a href="http://spacebook.mst.edu"&gt;Sandra Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. She’s on board the International Space Station… or at least, she will be for a few more days. When Discovery returns home, it’ll have her on board, taking her down to Earth where she’ll walk on a planet for the first time since November of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spacebook.mst.edu/2009/03/waiting_for_night_to_come_in_a.html"&gt;She just posted a beautiful entry&lt;/a&gt; where she takes the time to sit and watch the Earth roll underneath her as she passes silently over it at 8 kilometers per second. It’s vivid and wonderful, a description of the view that I hope the next generation of humans will find commonplace. For now though, it’s a rare gem, so enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237481785382"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/abc_thinks_were_all_morons.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e292348747d0a235</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">ABC thinks we're all morons</title><published>2009-03-19T17:32:23Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T17:32:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/WLaMWMXRHaU/abc_thinks_were_all_morons.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/abc_thinks_were_all_morons.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Who knows?

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you heard that right…on a so-called news program. But it gets worse! They have 4 people coming on to yell at each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the "Satan exists!" side, they have Pastor Mark Driscoll, head of a megachurch in Seattle, and Annie Lobert, former prostitute and founder of a group called Hookers for Jesus. Sensationalism is already rearing its gaudy head, you can tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse, the &amp;quot;Satan does not exist!&amp;quot; side is a joke. It consists of Bishop Carlton Pearson, who doesn&amp;#39;t accept the doctrine of hell but is a Christian, and…unbelievably…&lt;i&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/i&gt;. Not an atheist or skeptic among them, just hardcore believers in woo vs. fluffy believers in woo.&lt;/p&gt;

But looking at just the story alone, the situation may be more ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two adults go to a municipal building twice a week and clean the bathrooms, a job formerly done by the building's custodian.   According to the article, "The arrangement in Middletown started when the township's full-time custodian on the administrative side of the municipal center left last year." For their efforts, the pair receive $25 a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to train kids to be able to do these kind of jobs so as they turn 21, with some community support, they will be able to continue doing meaningful work," said IU special education supervisor Jane Strawley. "I think it's been win-win in Middletown, beneficial to both the employer and employees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree, finding meaningful job placement for people in the community is an excellent goal as long as the big picture is being accounted for and its what the people want (is self-determined).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some questions: Do the DD students themselves &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to clean bathrooms?  Do &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; feel it's "meaningful work" that they would like to continue?  Have they been given other options?  Also, are they being paid a competitive wage?  In other words, are they being paid what a starting custodian would have been paid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer could well be yes, the bathroom cleaning is totally self-determined, and yes, the adults are being paid a competitive wage for their work.  But the answer could also be an inadvertent exploitation, no matter how well intentioned.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any indication in the article about how the two adults feel (though we are told the people at the municipal building and the special education teacher who set up the deal feel wonderful about the situation), all that can be done by readers is speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note, there is a stereotype of people with developmental disabilities doing janitorial work--a job I have been fired from for incompetence because of perceptual, motor, and other difficulties.  Just because one has a learning or developmental disability does not mean a custodian job is appropriate work.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237478825108"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=5765">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/965f8ec90bfede52</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="pollution"/><category term="smoking"/><title type="html">By Your Own Emissions</title><published>2009-03-19T15:56:49Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T15:56:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/jA2uEX1Do1o/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/by-your-own-emissions/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">| We reported a while back that the true private mortality cost of smoking a pack of cigarettes is close to $222.

Many do not understand what a logical argument even is or how to do it correctly.  Yet arguing is an essential skill of critical thinking. How we argue reflects how we think, how we evaluate our own conclusions, and how we challenge the beliefs of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the very purpose of arguing is often misunderstood. I have arguments almost every day. This does not mean I verbally fight with others on a daily basis, but rather I have discussions that involve either attempting to convince another of a specific conclusion, or resolving different conclusions on a factual matter. In most of the arguments that I find myself the other person has staked out a position and they defend it jealously, as if they were a high-paid lawyer defending a client. This adversarial approach, however, is not constructive. Rather, the parties of an argument should be trying to find common ground, and then proceed carefully from that common ground to resolve any differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a logical argument is that it is, well… logical. It is, in a way, like mathematics. In math 1+1 must =2. If there is a disagreement about this, it can be resolved objectively and definitively. If two people doing the same math problem come up with different answers, how should they respond? Should they each defend their answer at all costs. Or, should they exam each other’s solution to see if one, or both, might contain an error, and then resolve the error to see what the correct answer is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if two people have come to different conclusions about a factual claim, then one or both must be wrong. Both cannot be correct. That means that one or both must have made an error in the arguments they used to come to their conclusions. The two parties should work together to examine their arguments and resolve any errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, this only works if the arguments are about factual claims, not subjective feelings or value judgments. There is no objective way to resolve a difference of opinion regarding aesthetics, for example. If you prefer Mozart to Beethoven, there is no way to prove that with facts or logic. It is very helpful, however, to identify when a conclusion contains an aesthetic opinion or a moral choice. It avoids arguing endlessly over an issue that is inherently irresolvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of this is the abortion debate. Ultimately, all arguments over abortion come down to a personal moral choice: which should have greater value, the mother’s right to make choices regarding her own body, or the unborn fetus’s right not to be killed. All attempts to resolve this objectively have resulted in further arguments that are dependent upon value judgments, for example: at what point at or after conception does an embryo or fetus become a person? Also, how does the fetus’s total biological dependence upon its mother affect their respective rights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure of a Logical Argument&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we are consciously aware of it or not, our arguments all follow a certain basic structure.  They begin with one or more premises, which are facts that the argument takes for granted as the starting point. Then a principle of logic is applied in order to come to a conclusion. This structure is often illustrated symbolically with the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premise1: 		If A = B,&lt;br&gt;
Premise2:		and B = C&lt;br&gt;
Logical connection: 	Then (apply principle of equivalence)&lt;br&gt;
Conclusion: 		A = C&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for an argument to be considered valid the logical form of the argument must work – must be valid. A valid argument is one in which, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true also. However, if one or more premise is false then a valid logical argument may still lead to a false conclusion. A sound argument is one in which the logic is valid and the premises are true, in which case the conclusion must be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it is important to note that and argument may use wrong information, or faulty logic to reach a conclusion that happens to be true. An invalid or unsound argument does not necessarily prove the conclusion false. Demonstrating that an argument is not valid or not sound, however, removes it as support for the truth of the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking down an argument into its components is a very useful exercise, for it enables us to examine both our own arguments and those of others and critically analyze them for validity. This is an excellent way of sharpening one’s thinking, avoiding biases, and making effective arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examine your Premises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, in order for an argument to be sound all of its premises must be true. Often, different people come to different conclusions because they are starting with different premises. So examining all the premises of each argument is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of potential problems with premises. The first, and most obvious, is that a premise can be wrong. If one argues, for example, that evolutionary theory is false because there are no transitional fossils, that argument is unsound because the premise – no transitional fossils – is false. In fact there are copious transitional fossils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another type of premise error occurs when one or more premises is an unwarranted assumption. The premise may or may not be true, but it has not been established sufficiently to serve as a premise for an argument. Identifying all the assumptions upon which an argument is dependent is often the most critical step in analyzing an argument. Frequently, different conclusions are arrived at because of differing assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often people will choose the assumptions that best fit the conclusion they prefer. In fact, psychological experiments show that most people start with conclusions they desire, then reverse engineer arguments to support them – a process called rationalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to resolve the problem of using assumptions as premises is to carefully identify and disclose those assumptions up front. Such arguments are often called “hypothetical,” or prefaced with the statement “Let’s assume for the sake of argument.”  Also, if two people examine their arguments and realize they are using different assumptions as premises, then at least they can “agree to disagree.” They will realize that their disagreement cannot be resolved until more information is available to clarify which assumptions are more likely to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third type of premise difficulty is the most insidious: the hidden premise. I have seen this listed as a logical fallacy – the unstated major premise, but it is more accurate to consider it here. Obviously, if a disagreement is based upon a hidden premise, then the disagreement will be irresolvable. So when coming to an impasse in resolving differences, it is a good idea to go back and see if there are any implied premises that have not been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the transitional fossil example again. Why is it that scientists believe we have many transitional fossils and evolution deniers (creationists or intelligent design proponents) believe that we do not. This would seem to be a straightforward factual claim easily resolvable by checking the evidence. Sometimes evolution deniers are simply ignorant of the evidence or are being intellectually dishonest. However, the more sophisticated are fully aware of the fossil evidence and use a hidden premise to deny the existence of transitional fossils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a paleontologist speaks of “transitional” fossils, they are referring to species that occupy a space morphologically between two known species. This may be a common ancestor, in which case the transitional fossil will be more ancient than both descendant species; or it can be temporally between two species, the descendant of one and the ancestor of the other. But in reality we often do not know if the transitional species is an actual ancestor or just closely related to the true ancestor. Because evolution is a bushy process, and not linear, most of the specimens we find will lie on an evolutionary side branch (an uncle rather than a parent). But if they fill a morphological gap in known species, they provide evidence of an evolutionary connection, and therefore qualify as transitional. For example, archaeopteryx may not be on the direct path to modern birds, but clearly they occupy a space that is transitional between therapod dinosaurs and modern birds and one of their close relatives is a direct ancestor to modern birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When evolution deniers say there are no transitional fossils their unstated major premise is that they are employing a different definition of transitional than is generally accepted in the scientific community. They typically define transitional as some impossible monster with half-formed and useless structures. Or, they may define transitional as only those fossils for which there is independent proof of being a true ancestor, rather than simply closely related to a direct ancestor – an impossible standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hidden premise in their argument is the notion of how many transitional fossils there &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be in the fossil record.  They, of course, can always assume an arbitrarily high number to claim that there isn’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical Fallacies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when all of the premises of an argument are reliably true, the argument may still be invalid if the logic employed is not legitimate – a so called logical fallacy. The human brain is a marvelous machine with capabilities that, in some ways, still outperform the most powerful of super computers.  Our brains, however, do not appear to have evolved specifically for precise logic.  There are many common logical pitfalls that our minds tend to fall into, unless we are consciously aware of these pitfalls and make efforts to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans also tend to use logical short-cuts, called heuristics. These are thought processes that are not strictly valid in their logic, but are true most of the time and therefore are a useful rule-of-thumb as to what is likely to be true. But they get us into trouble when then substitute for valid logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also because, as stated above, there is a tendency to start with desired conclusions and then construct arguments to support them, many people will happily draw upon logical fallacies to make their arguments. In fact, if a conclusion is not true one must either employ a false premise or a logical fallacy in order to construct an argument that leads to that conclusion. Remember, a sound argument (one with true premises and valid logic) cannot lead to a false conclusion. So in order to avoid using logical fallacies to construct invalid arguments, we need to understand how to identify fallacious logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I will list the most common logical fallacies, with examples of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I have found many lists of logical fallacies, and they tend to differ along the “lumper vs splitter” spectrum. Many fallacies are really just specific subtypes of a more general fallacy. I have taken a combined approach, listing the main types of fallacies and giving examples of subtypes where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Sequitur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Latin this term translates to “doesn’t follow.” This refers to an argument in which the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. In other words, a logical connection is implied where none exists. This is the most basic type of logical fallacy, and in fact all logical fallacies are non-sequiturs, but are an identifiable and common type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Argument from authority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The basic structure of such arguments is as follows: Professor X believes A, Professor X speaks from authority, therefore A is true. Often this argument is implied by emphasizing the many years of experience, or the formal degrees held by the individual making a specific claim. The converse of this argument is sometimes used, that someone does not possess authority, and therefore their claims must be false. (This may also be considered an ad-hominen logical fallacy – see below.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice this can be a complex logical fallacy to deal with. It is legitimate to consider the training and experience of an individual when examining their assessment of a particular claim. Also, a consensus of scientific opinion does carry some legitimate authority. But it is still possible for highly educated individuals, and a broad consensus to be wrong – speaking from authority does not make a claim true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This logical fallacy crops up in more subtle ways also. For example, UFO proponents have argued that UFO sightings by airline pilots should be given special weight because pilots are trained observers, are reliable characters, and are trained not to panic in emergencies. In essence, they are arguing that we should trust the pilot’s authority as an eye witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many subtypes of the argument from authority, essentially referring to the implied source of authority. A common example is the argument ad populi - a belief must be true because it is popular, essentially assuming the authority of the masses. Another example is the argument from antiquity - a belief has been around for a long time and therefore must be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Argument from final outcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Such arguments (also called teleological) are based on a reversal of cause and effect, because they argue that something is caused by the ultimate effect that it has, or purpose that is serves. Christian creationists have argued, for example, that evolution must be wrong because if it were true it would lead to immorality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is perhaps the most common of logical fallacies.  It follows the basic format of A preceded B, therefore A caused B, and therefore assumes cause and effect for two events just because they are temporally related (the Latin translates to “after this, therefore because of this”).  This logical fallacy is frequently invoked when defending various forms of alternative medicine - I was sick, I took treatment A, I got better, therefore treatment A made me better. This is a logical fallacy because it is possible to have recovered from an illness without any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confusing correlation with causation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is similar to the post-hoc fallacy in that it assumes cause and effect for two variables simply because they occur together. This fallacy is often used to give a statistical correlation a causal interpretation.  For example, during the 1990’s both religious attendance and illegal drug use have been on the rise.  It would be a fallacy to conclude that therefore, religious attendance causes illegal drug use.  It is also possible that drug use leads to an increase in religious attendance, or that both drug use and religious attendance are increased by a third variable, such as an increase in societal unrest. It is also possible that both variables are independent of one another, and it is mere coincidence that they are both increasing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fallacy, however, has a tendency to be abused, or applied inappropriately, to deny all statistical evidence. In fact this constitutes a logical fallacy in itself, the denial of causation. This abuse takes two basic forms. The first is to deny the significance of correlations that are demonstrated with prospective controlled data, such as would be acquired during a clinical experiment. The problem with assuming cause and effect from mere correlation is not that a causal relationship is impossible, it’s just that there are other variables that must be considered and not ruled out a-priori. A controlled trial, however, by its design attempts to control for as many variables as possible in order to maximize the probability that a positive correlation is in fact due to a causation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, even with purely epidemiological, or statistical, evidence it is still possible to build a strong scientific case for a specific cause. The way to do this is to look at multiple independent correlations to see if they all point to the same causal relationship. For example, it was observed that cigarette smoking correlates with getting lung cancer. The tobacco industry, invoking the “correlation is not causation” logical fallacy, argued that this did not prove causation. They offered as an alternate explanation “factor x”, a third variable that causes both smoking and lung cancer. But we can make predictions based upon the smoking causes cancer hypothesis. If this is the correct causal relationship, then duration of smoking should correlate with cancer risk, quitting smoking should decrease cancer risk, smoking unfiltered cigarettes should have a higher cancer risk than filtered cigarettes, etc. If all of these correlations turn out to be true, which they are, then we can triangulate to the smoking causes cancer hypothesis as the most likely possible causal relationship and it is not a logical fallacy to conclude from this evidence that smoking probably causes lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special pleading, or ad-hoc reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a subtle fallacy which is often difficult to recognize.  In essence, it is the arbitrary introduction of new elements into an argument in order to jerry rig them, or fix them so that they appear valid. A good example of this is the ad-hoc dismissal of negative test results.  For example, one might argue that ESP has never been demonstrated under adequate test conditions, therefore ESP is not a genuine phenomenon. Defenders of ESP have attempted to counter this argument by introducing the arbitrary premise that ESP does not work in the presence of skeptics. This fallacy is often taken to ridiculous extremes, and more and more bizarre ad hoc elements are added to explain experimental failures or logical inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Sagan gave perhaps the most famous example of this fallacy in his “invisible, floating, non-corporeal, heatless, dragon in his garage” argument.  Essentially, he claims that there is a dragon in his garage, and then invents a special reason why each test for the presence of the dragon fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tu quoque&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tu quoque translates to “you too.” This is an attempt to justify wrong action because someone else also does it. “My evidence may be bad, but so is yours.” This fallacy is frequently committed by proponents of various alternative medicine modalities, who argue that even though their therapies may lack evidence more mainstream modalities also lack evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad hominem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An ad hominem argument is any that attempts to counter another’s claims or conclusions by attacking the person, rather than addressing the argument itself. True believers will often commit this fallacy by countering the arguments of skeptics by stating that skeptics are closed minded. Skeptics, on the other hand, may fall into the trap of dismissing the claims of UFO believers, for example, by stating that people who believe in UFO’s are crazy or stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common form of this fallacy is also frequently present in the arguments of conspiracy theorists (who also rely heavily on ad-hoc reasoning). For example, they may argue that the government must be lying because they are corrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “poisoning the well” also refers to a form of ad hominem fallacy.  This is an attempt to discredit the argument of another by implying that they possess an unsavory trait, or that they are affiliated with other beliefs or people that are wrong or unpopular. A common form of this also has its own name - Godwin’s Law or the reductio ad Hitlerum. This refers to an attempt at poisoning the well by drawing an analogy between another’s position and Hitler or the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad ignorantum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The argument from ignorance basically states that a specific belief is true because we don’t know that it isn’t true. Defenders of extrasensory perception, for example, will often overemphasize how much we do not know about the human brain. It is therefore possible, they argue, that the brain may be capable of transmitting signals at a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UFO proponents are probably the most frequent violators of this fallacy. Almost all UFO eyewitness evidence is ultimately an argument from ignorance – lights or objects sighted in the sky are unknown, and therefore they are alien spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intelligent design is almost entirely based upon this fallacy. The core argument for intelligent design is that there are biological structures that have not been fully explained by evolution, therefore a powerful intelligent designer must have created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make a positive claim, however, positive evidence for the specific claim must be presented. The absence of another explanation only means that we do not know - it doesn’t mean we get to make up a specific explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confusing currently unexplained with unexplainable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because we do not currently have an adequate explanation for a phenomenon does not mean that it is forever unexplainable, or that it therefore defies the laws of nature or requires a paranormal explanation. An example of this is the “God of the Gaps” strategy of creationists that whatever we cannot currently explain is unexplainable and was therefore an act of god.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Continuum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The idea that because there is no definitive demarcation line between two extremes, that the distinction between the extremes is not real or meaningful: For example, there is a fuzzy line between cults and religion, therefore they are really the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Dichotomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Arbitrarily reducing a set of many possibilities to only two. For example, evolution is not possible, therefore we must have been created (assumes these are the only two possibilities). This fallacy can also be used to oversimplify a continuum of variation to two black and white choices. For example, science and pseudoscience are not two discrete entities, but rather the methods and claims of all those who attempt to explain reality fall along a continuum from one extreme to the other. Reducing all factual claims to either pure science or pure pseudoscience would be creating a false dichotomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inconsistency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Applying criteria or rules to one belief, claim, argument, or position but not to others. For example, some consumer advocates argue that we need stronger regulation of prescription drugs to ensure their safety and effectiveness, but at the same time argue that medicinal herbs should be sold with no regulation for either safety or effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reductio ad absurdum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In formal logic, the reductio ad absurdum is a legitimate argument. It follows the form that if the premises are assumed to be true it necessarily leads to an absurd (false) conclusion and therefore one or more premises must be false. The term is now often used to refer to the abuse of this style of argument, by stretching the logic in order to force an absurd conclusion. For example a UFO enthusiast once argued that if I am skeptical about the existence of alien visitors, I must also be skeptical of the existence of the Great Wall of China, since I have not personally seen either. This is a false reductio ad absurdum because he is ignoring evidence other than personal eyewitness evidence, and also logical inference. In short, being skeptical of UFO’s does not require rejecting the existence of the Great Wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slippery Slope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This logical fallacy is the argument that a position is not consistent or tenable because accepting the position means that the extreme of the position must also be accepted. But moderate positions do not necessarily lead down the slippery slope to the extreme. This is common in politics. For example, some opponents to embryonic stem cell research have argued that allowing the use of human embryos in research (even those created for IVF that would otherwise be discarded) would inevitably lead to creating embryos specifically for research, a black market in human embryos, or even the forcible extraction of eggs for such research from women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tautology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tautology is an argument that utilizes circular reasoning, which means that the conclusion is also its own premise. The structure of such arguments is A=B therefore A=B, although the premise and conclusion might be formulated differently so it is not immediately apparent as such. For example, saying that therapeutic touch works because it manipulates the life force is a tautology because the definition of therapeutic touch is the alleged manipulation (without touching) of the life force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Moving Goalpost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A method of denial arbitrarily moving the criteria for “proof” or acceptance out of range of whatever evidence currently exists. If new evidence comes to light meeting the prior criteria, the goalpost is pushed back further - keeping it out of range of the new evidence. Sometimes impossible criteria are set up at the start - moving the goalpost impossibly out of range -for the purpose of denying an undesirable conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list of logical fallacies is certainly incomplete. A thorough treatment of this topic is more appropriate to a rather large book than a blog post. However, applying this basic approach to arguing would, in my experience, vastly improve the arguing style of most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just remember to apply these rules to yourself first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;

Whoop-te-doo, I say — anybody who has been following creationism at all knows that they happily trot out this claim all the time. We&amp;#39;ve got all kinds of concrete examples of observed evolutionary change in lizards and insects and birds and fish, so their argument has &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; been that they accept a small amount of change, but there are magical limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new exhibit at the Answers in Genesis Creation Museum argues that natural selection -- Darwin's explanation for how species develop new traits over time -- can coexist with the creationist assertion that all living things were created by God just a few thousand years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"We wanted to show people that creationists believe in natural selection," said Ken Ham, founder of the Christian ministry Answers in Genesis and frequent Darwin critic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The exhibit might seem peculiar to many who have watched the decades-long battle between evolution scientists and creationists, who take the Bible's Genesis account as literal truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it isn't. This is old stuff and an elementary distortion of evolutionary theory that the creationists have been using for years. It's the same as their old distinction between microevolution, which they say they accept while not understanding what it is, and macroevolution, which they say they reject while in a similar state of blind ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspapers are getting played for a chump. They even asked Eugenie Scott's opinion of this "development", and she flat out told them it was old news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea that creationists can accept natural selection "isn't really new in creationism, though it's interesting that Answers in Genesis would have an exhibit on it," said Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that they have an exhibit in that we would like to see how they've mangled good science this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/this_is_not_news_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/BKekIzRWKeM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237470664549"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/gary_goodyear_believes_in_evol.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c0005f796e49510</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Gary Goodyear “believes” in “evolution”</title><published>2009-03-19T14:06:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T14:06:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/zxnXCxCWwcc/gary_goodyear_believes_in_evol.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/gary_goodyear_believes_in_evol.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Canadian science minister who first refused to answer a question about his support for religion because it was querying his personal religion has now flip-flopped and said that he &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; accept evolution.

I don't know if I'll ever discuss or explain on this blog what the last straw resulting in that transformation was (it's too personal), but a couple of years ago I did go through a period where I became hostile to religion, perhaps spurred on by PZ and the whole anti-religion &lt;em&gt;gestalt&lt;/em&gt; of the ScienceBlogs Collective here. That lasted maybe a year or two, during which time I did what every new disillusioned ex-religious person seems to do (reading books like Richard Dawkins' &lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt;, for instance) but eventually my hostility abated, as regular readers may have noticed by the topics and writing tone right here on this very blog. (Don't worry, quackery and the antivaccine movement still get me as worked up as ever--perhaps even more so.) These days religion just doesn't matter that much to me one way or the other, except for when it interferes with concrete things that matter, such as patient care,  the teaching of science, or civil rights. Since then, for the most part it's been live and let live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I still maintain a healthy interest in the interface between science and religion or, more specifically, the interface between religion and medicine. That's why a study released in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; yesterday caught my interest. A news story in the &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-sci-faith18-2009mar18,0,1410553.story"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; about this study describes it thusly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After she was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer that had spread to her left lung, Gloria Bailey's doctors recommended she have a mastectomy followed by hormone therapy to fight the tumors that remained. She followed their advice, but had a nagging feeling about the regimen. 

&lt;p&gt;"The Lord was just telling me, 'They're not being aggressive enough,' " Bailey recalled. So she sought out a new team of oncologists at the Cancer Treatment Centers of America's Midwestern Regional Medical Center in Zion, Ill., more than 300 miles away from her home in Michigan.

Go God Go! Still the journalist, Nicholas Hirshon, is a professional and knows that extraordinary claims need extraordinaty evidence, so he contacted the 'Experts' at the Queens Botanical Garden: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[The] Experts identified the plant as a member of the amaranth family... Horticulturalists at the garden have never seen an amaranth take an elephant-like shape, garden spokesman Tim Heimerle said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"For it to have that long trunk like this is not a natural thing," he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;So this miracle is pretty much confirmed right‽* &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I mean the expert did say that right‽ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;That it wasn't natural‽ Really‽‽ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;I mean if, for example, one was to buy a packet of the seeds it wouldn't mention it on the packet would it‽&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Would it‽&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Would it‽&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Oh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/data/media/api/user/Skeptobot/albumid/5307131136924767569/photoid/5314866375585762498/1237463759905000?authkey=Gv1sRgCKrZ5vTInIX0uAE"&gt;&lt;img src="http://picasaweb.google.com/data/media/api/user/Skeptobot/albumid/5307131136924767569/photoid/5314866303120363490/1237463742641000?authkey=Gv1sRgCKrZ5vTInIX0uAE" height="460" width="299" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So yeah, apparently miracles cost &lt;a href="http://www.groworganic.com/item_SNV505_Seeds_of_Change_Amaranth_Elephan.html?welcome=T&amp;amp;theses=3566962"&gt;$3.29 a packet&lt;/a&gt;... The shop page goes on: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason it's called Elephant Head is that the deep-red bloom grows quite large (36-40") with a long (18-24") protuberance that looks like an elephant's trunk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;It's an example of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum"&gt;simulacra&lt;/a&gt; that's been given a lot of weight by a believer. That's fair enough, and at least it's prettier than &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=jesus%20in%20toast&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tab=wi"&gt;Jesus-In-Toast&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=allah%20in%20tomato&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;tab=wi"&gt;Allah-In-Tomato&lt;/a&gt;. But it would appear that neither the journalist, nor the 'Expert' even bothered to use google before racing to spread the miracle to 650,000 people. That's if the 'Expert' was even contacted. Or quoted fairly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Journalist Fail. Expert Fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;Tut tut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;* ‽ &lt;em&gt;is an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang"&gt;&lt;em&gt;interrobang&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

In that time I’ve resurrected an elderly program, and several readers have made their own weasels from scratch. Commenter Anders has even made a &lt;a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/courses/27615.mol/weasel.php" rel="external "&gt;Python version&lt;/a&gt; that puts “freely mutating” and “locking versions” head to head with great graphs. (&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Wes Elsberry did a head to head comparison last year, &lt;a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2008/10/19/dembski-and-marks-are-still-mischaracterizing-dawkins-weasel/" rel="external "&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt; for his comparison [scroll down], it differs from my implementation but the basic message is the same). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve gone back and done a head to head comparison myself between a program with no “locking” (all letters in any given string have a chance to be mutated) and one with “&lt;a href="https://webmail.adelaide.edu.au/horde/util/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Faustringer.net%2Fwp%2Findex.php%2F2007%2F10%2F09%2Ftoday-is-a-fine-day-for-a-woollen-kettle-or-a-copper-sweater%2F&amp;amp;Horde=d05da374ed3b6fae1488aa30a855d6b7" rel="external "&gt;locking&lt;/a&gt;” (where the matching letters are preserved against mutation). Trying to implement “locking” &lt;em&gt;al la&lt;/em&gt; Dembski proved too hard. You have to keep indices of the letter locations and keep updating them. It is such a pain in the bottom to try and do this that I cannot imagine Dawkins even wanting to try and program a “Locking” implementation in GBASIC. Remember, Dawkins weasel was a quick and dirty program bashed out in a short time. To implement “locking” I just kept a copy of the parent string unmutated (after all, in the real world not every offspring has mutations in genes of interest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/19/images/weasel_dynamics.png" rel=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/assets_c/2009/03/weasel_dynamics-thumb-360x298-345.png" alt="weasel_dynamics.png" width="360" height="298" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see they were much the same (mean and standard error of an average of 4 independent runs per condition shown, click to embiggen). “Locked” runs finished earlier, on average but most of the trajectory of the run was determined by mutation supply. As you can see, runs done with locked and unlocked versions fell within the error bars of each other, for runs that set the Offspring number at either 100 or 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is easy to understand. Early on, virtually any mutation is of big benefit, while later on most mutations are of small benefit. Only in the final stages that there was any significant backing and forthing, and then only in the 30 Offspring case. In the 100 offspring case, the population was so large that the probability was high that even in the final stages a beneficial mutation would be acquired. Wesley Elsberry has done the mathematics explicitly (go to &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=14;t=6034;st=0" rel="external "&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down). Only in the 30 offspring case was the last 10 or so generations in an “unlocked” run spent bouncing from 3-1 differences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Dembski’s claims that a list of every 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; output string shows that Dawkins is using a “locking” program are nonsense, Dawkins results are exactly what we would expect to see when sampling sparsely from a high population “freely mutating” weasel run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/19/images/weasel_convergance_time.png" rel=""&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/assets_c/2009/03/weasel_convergance_time-thumb-360x304-347.png" alt="weasel_convergance_time.png" width="360" height="304" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly more surprisingly, the median time to convergence (when the program finally reached the target string), was not actually statistically significantly different. I suspect when enough runs are accumulated (say around 20), they will be, but the “locked” runs are only about 20% faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, summary. Whether you “lock” your strings, or allow them to mutate at all positions freely, a weasel program will converge on a solution. The for most of the time, mutation supply dominates, and whether you lock your strings or not there is rapid accumulation of beneficial mutations. Only at the very end run does “locking” matter, and then only for small populations where the probability of a beneficial mutation is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even then, “unlocked”, freely mutating programs will converge on a solution in less than a minute (and only 20% slower than the “locking” programs), when simple random sampling will take longer than the lifespan of the Universe to converge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the point is that against all evidence, Dembski believes that Dawkins wrote a overly complicated program in GBASIC, and then reverted to a simple one for a TV show, and can’t be bothered to get around to writing the code that would show him wrong (and show that freely mutating programs converge rapidly on the target string). Again, this shows that cdesign proponetists don’t understand the “test your hypothesis” part of science. I’m currently &lt;a href="http://astroblogger.blogspot.com/2009/03/blogging-starry-messenger-stars.html" rel="external "&gt;reading Galileo’s “Starry Messenger”&lt;/a&gt;, and the debate over at Uncommon Descent  reminds me of Francesco Sizzi, who declared that Galileo really couldn’t have seen Moons around Jupiter, as metaphysics demands there only be 7 planets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now If only they would put the same degree of effort that they put into critiquing the weasel program, a toy demonstration of selection the same importance as the &lt;a href="http://www.icp.org.nz/html/drug_clearance_1.html" rel="external "&gt;measuring cylinder/running tap model&lt;/a&gt; of drug clearance, into doing some real science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The freely mutating QBASIC program is &lt;a href="http://home.mira.net/~reynella1/weasle2b.bas" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the “locked” version is &lt;a href="http://home.mira.net/~reynella1/WEASLE2E.BAS" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (both write strings to a log file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to submit your own weasels, especially ones that compare freely mutating vs “locking” versions of the code, and the PT crew could do with a java applet version if you could do one. A weasel for every 6 hours the Uncommon Descent people do nothing would be great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See Wesley Elsberries superb &lt;a href="http://www.antievolution.org/features/ec/weasel102.html" rel="external "&gt;Java Weasel&lt;/a&gt; as an example!

I recently took a historial look over the landscape at characteristics and forms of quackery that could yield some perspective, and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pseudoscience and quackery were identifiable long before we were here. Mesmer was deposed by Franklin and Lavoisier &amp;amp; Co.  Samuel Hahnemann’s homeopathy was recognized as false by contemporaries, and by 1840s Oliver W. Holmes, Sr. had a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/homeopathy_deconstructed_in_the_faseb_jo.php"&gt;merry time deriding the entire theory&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the ability of good scientists to recognize medical nonsense, much of 19th century medicine practiced was by school of thought or philosophy - sectarian practice. Some of these were homeopathic, herbal, hydropathic (water, baths) osteopathic, medicinal, surgical, empiricist, eclectic and naturopathic. Much of this was indistinguishable from quackery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1911, most institutions of sectarian and ideological approaches were demolished by the Flexner recommendations, resulting in reform of medical schools. Quackery became the separate ideas of individuals - Hoxsey, Ivy, Gerson, Binkley. Some schools like homeopathy and sects like osteopathy and chiropractic continued separate from medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After WW II quackery began to be promoted by political activity. Sects and schools began to lobby for licensure, recognition, and later, insurance payments. In the 1970s-80s sectarianism/quackery became recognized by political groups as vehicles for their political causes. The movement started in right wing causes. Not conservative, but high emotion, radical, scofflaw behavior. People who had to leave the country to do their things. Laetrile became a political symbol for anti-regulation and far right politics. The John Birch Society, then more prominent and radical than it is today, was one of the main support orgs. Most supporters berated regulatory agencies. They bore bumper stickers, “Go to Health, FDA.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left met right over the Laetrile conflicts, as both extremes considered Laetrile to be effective and wanted it available. (Laetrile was a science and commercial fraud, its biochemistry and biology made up by its creator, E. Krebs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rhetoric then was near-revolutionary, paranoid, anti-government and anti-regulatory. Laetrile popularity was a product of anti-regulatory rhetoric. Steve Barrtett, Victor Herbert and a few others worked as experts for government agencies and boards against the problem. At that time, the agencies were largely free of both industry and ideological pressures. We exchanged information, we testified in court. There was general agreement regarding what constituted knowledge, good practice and quackery. Most elected officials were on the side of regulation and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime consultants were prominent academicians - from whom I learned most of my stuff. Robert Hodges MD of Berkeley and then Irvine, had determined the minimum daily requirement and intake of ascorbate, Tom Jukes PhD of Berkeley, had synthesized amethopterin and aminopterin, the folate inhibitors and first chemotherapy cures of acute lymphocytic leukemia (although the Nobel went to the docs at Farber in Boston who first used it). Robert Stockstad was Chairman of nutrition/biochemistry at Berkeley. All met at Jukes’s home, and formed what became the &lt;a href="http://www.ncahf.org/"&gt;National Council against Health Fraud&lt;/a&gt; in 1976. Where are the academicians and faculty now? Accepting funding from &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=36"&gt;NCCAM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.osher.hms.harvard.edu/"&gt;Osher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=399"&gt;Bravewell&lt;/a&gt;, and selling out for bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t recall any political differences among the scientists and physicians and the regulators, except that we all recognized the anti-science and anti-regulation propaganda of right wing and Birchers. Although we understood their political positions, we did not quite understand the depth of their fears of science and anti-fraud regulation. We considered those self-evident and part of a sane society. Neither did we have much understanding of their personal psychologies, or of the group and social dynamics that caused this first quacky-political movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw similarities to the episodes described in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds"&gt;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&lt;/a&gt;. We were impressed by the scope and suddenness with which the Laetrile thing had developed. I called it a thing because there had never been anything like it to name it after. The economic delusions of the book, the Salem witch trials, the Nazi movement, most old-time quackery seemed different. The difference was that Laetrile had become a social, political, and economic movement besides its medical claims. Books were written. Meetings and rallies were held. An entire belief system surrounded the molecule and the apricot pit. Even the Mafia got involved in manufacture and sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Hatch (R Utah) had just emerged, and there was no other congressional sympathizer or advocate. Most activities were in the states. They were aided by Congr. Richardson (a MD from No. Carolina and a John Bircher,) and the Freedom of Choice in Cancer Therapy organization, all supporters of the Laetrile movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2000, a major shift had occurred. Although chiropractic seemed to adhere more to right wing principles, and right holdovers Hatch, Burton, and the old-style supplement set persisted, quackery’s advanced guard had become predominantly left-wing. It included the cultural relativism, post-modern wing that fertilizes “Integrative” medicine. The push in California for naturopaths and for loosening practice guidelines for sectarian practices came from the left. The ’90s had brought a surprising and revolutionary change - from the left, and recognizable as the outgrowth of the student rebellions of the 1960s - manifested in 40-50 year olds who bore the same anti-establishment psychologies of their youth. That part of the change was easy enough to see and understand. But what came next surprised and perplexed us, taking us another decade to figure out. It was political attack from the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the anti-government freedom of choicers were easy to figure out - challenging regulation in the name of lying for profit - the force from the left was obscure and largely ideological. Its economic challenge hidden behind a new language that distorted meaning to the point where rationalists could not argue right and wrong any more. Unlike the political right, whose lines in the sand were visible, identifiable, definable and arguable, the new “holistic/alternative attacks changed descriptive language, and beyond that, managed to change the rules of the game without changing the laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of attacking the regulatory agencies head on, they infiltrated academia - in fact used the new relativistic politic and post-modern rule bending and language distortion to confuse the traditionalists. So much so that rationalists - scientists, physicians, as well as agency officials had to re-define themselves in order to determine what they stood for. What are we, rationalists? Traditionalists? logical positivists? Obstructionists? Old farts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In opposition were the PoMos who needed to do no such thing. They operated by stealth, infiltrating education, the press, got elected, taught in law schools, supplying judges and legislators. Thus a whole generation populated the elite of North America, thinking the way postmodernists do, reshaping laws, customs, mores, and language, using them as tools to re-form their surroundings to conform to their own specific outlooks. The mindset elevated neutrality to the highest good, demoted informed opinion to bias, and demeaned rationality to somewhere between learning the alphabet and learning to whistle. Little wonder that objective measurement yielded to “benefits” of placebo, or should be treated as equal to the effective method if it has “meaning” to the patient. or is that client?I glean several principles from this look-back. First, the social forms of pseudoscientific medicine changed in some unpredictable ways. From schools and sects to single ideas and practices, to cults with support groups, specific pseudoscientific ideation, culminating in political movements with press for legitimacy through legislation, courts, licensure, and sales forces for selling opinion to the public, then to assaults on science and medical ethics as tools for advancement.Second, the changing faces and mechanisms represent the opportunistic advances the movements make using defects in the social structure of the time. Analogies abound - epidemics, invasions, cultural terrorism being a few. Adaptable, changeable, surreptitious, audacious. That’s quite an objective to counter.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29755714/"&gt;12-year-old boy on the autism spectrum&lt;/a&gt; "suddenly became violent" at his school in Tennessee, is handcuffed, arrested, charged with assault. I read about this and think: My son's autistic, he's almost 12, "behaviors" are something his teacher and Jim and I talk plenty about and help my son to work on. I think about the recent &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/not_prepared_criminal_justice_and_individuals_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;discussion about violence&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting arrested and charged with assault?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey"&gt;far away&lt;/a&gt; I recall how a friend asked me about what was going to be the hardest part about traveling to Greece. I thought about what it had taken to plan the trip---finding a good travel agency to work with, designing an itinerary, recruiting students, writing a syllabus (it's a trip and class combined), getting medical and insurance forms filled out, figuring out who's rooming with whom, holding a number of pre-travel classes to instruct the students in some modern Greek (our instructor is a former student who's Greek---Ευχαριστώ!)---and realized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all a lot easier than taking care of Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may read that statement as meaning "taking care of an autistic child"---and my son has some very severe needs----is a "burden" and, really, "unbearable." It's true, Jim and I know we've never faced such challenges as in our efforts to help Charlie and get him what he needs. While we're currently grateful for the type and level of education and services Charlie has, we've only gotten him these by constant efforts, a significant outlay of financial resources, moving around the country and New Jersey, and directing the better part of our energies (physical as well as mental, it often seems) towards him. It's all been worth it though, as the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;past few months&lt;/a&gt; when Charlie has been in something of a crisis situation, we've over been beset by strain and stress and unsure of what to do and if there is anything we can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, I wasn't sure at all that I could go on, of all things, a trip to ....... Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and I had planned that my parents would visit from California during the time I would be away and I've been strategizing since the fall with Charlie's teacher. I mean, let's get serious here----how could I be away from Charlie for over a week and an ocean and a couple of time zones away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, planning for Charlie has been my main "travel preparation." I made sure to order refills on all of his medications. There's been lots to alert my parents to about his likes and interests and habits. I've been working on a picture calendar to show when I'll be gone and back and puzzling over how to explain about Greece to Charlie----about me flying over an ocean to another country. I covered the refrigerator with instructions for Charlie's medications, his bedtime routine, what goes in his bookbag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've packed the minimum of "personal effects" for myself in a backpack and a messenger bag. Unusual for me these days was that I packed a number of books---the Greek classics we'll be discussing on the trip and a novel I've been storing up. Usually when I've traveled in the past years it's been with Charlie and, accordingly, I've mostly packed what he might need on the airplane. (Though, airplane travel with Charlie has actually gotten quite (gasp) easy---I'm careful to choose flights late at night or very early in the morning, so Charlie sleeps for most of the trip.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I've learned one lesson over these years with Charlie, it's how little I need to carry on my back for myself, because my boy (and my other guy) are always with me, walking beside and before me in spirit if not actually. I know with every step we take together, the day draws nearer when Charlie will be walking the road alone and the time to start preparing him is now.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a quarterly multi-language research journal mainly about Scandinavian archaeology and Medieval art, and I'm proud to be its managing editor. Now we've gone one step further and made the thing into an Open Access journal. The site's run of the journal is complete up to 6 months ago, and every issue will henceforth appear on-line half a year after it was distributed on paper. Here, for instance, is an &lt;a href="http://fornvannen.se/pdf/2000talet/2008_081.pdf"&gt;excellent paper&lt;/a&gt; in English by my buddy Svante Fischer from last summer's issue, about the implications of two Scandinavian gold pendants of the Migration Period found in Serbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the continuing adventures of the Cast and Crew of The Skeptologists, I would like to share with you a bit of rough-edited never-before seen footage. This was shot during the Pilot of The Skeptologists and for reasons you will soon understand, it was never included in the final version of the pilot. I found the event interesting and it solidified my thoughts about how people interpret events based on their own predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Andrew Wakefield from the UK is almost single-handedly responsible for the recent incarnation of anti-vaccine hysteria. In 1998 he published a study that suggested MMR vaccines caused or contributed to autism. After a few years, scientists discovered huge flaws in his findings, dismissed the study as crap, and Wakefield was discredited with serious allegations against him. And all the co-authors of the Wakefield study rejected their own study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Wakefield brought his nonsense to the U.S. where he made a number of political allies to help rebrand himself as a kind of messiah exposing the big medical cover-up that vaccines are to blame for autism. They were good marketers and sold these claims to parents of autistic children desperate to make sense of why this happened to their child and looking for someone to blame. As more and more studies started popping up that overturned Wakefield’s original findings, the vaccine claims started to morph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was getting harder and harder to continue to blame MMR vaccines, so Wakefield and his allies gradually began to shift their claims to include thimerosal, a mercury preservative that some nations had removed from vaccines in the 90’s as a precaution and that was removed from almost all U.S. vaccines in 2001 mainly to shut up ill-informed critics. The claims continued to morph to keep the old anti-vaccine game alive in the publics mind as more and more studies emerged debunking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then back in September a study very similar to Wakefield’s was conducted. This time though, steps were taken to eliminate some of the problems with Wakefield’s orginal study. Further, one of the scientists involved was a diehard member of the anti-vaccine movement. But something interesting happened. When this study showed that Wakefield was dead wrong, this anti-vaccinationist threw in the towel and accepted the reality that Wakefield was wrong and that vaccines don’t cause autism. This was, if I’m not mistaken, the 16th study to directly challenge and refute Wakefield’s previous and current claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to about a month ago, when journalist and Wakefield critic discovered irrefutable evidence that Wakefield either deliberately fabricated information in his original 1998 study or was an unbelievably incompetent fool with the odds leaning heaving in favor of the former. Anti-vaccinationists were left with no other option but to declare thermonuclear war against Deer in a huge campaign to destroy his character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/brian_deer_responds_to_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;Brian Deer speaks out&lt;/a&gt; and exposes the latest flat-out lies being perpetuated against him and in defense of already long discredited Wakefield. And it turns out their lies aren’t even very good and are easily proven false.&lt;/p&gt;

There, I admitted it. Now I don’t mean to say that I like all television commercials. Zeus knows most of them are god-awful and are best casually observed with the mute button on. And I definitely hate commercials when watching television shows on the internet, though I can  accept them because they’re fewer in number. And I definitely hate seeing commercials for non-film related products in a movie theater before the show begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every once and a while a creative commercial comes along that I like, pretty much regardless of what the product its selling is. And while I don’t wish to promote the Dove brand (though I do tend to buy Dove), I’m liking their Campaign For Real Beauty, particularly this commercial here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No commentary for me about it yet today - I hope others will start first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introductory editorial is here: &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7236/full/458260a.html" title=""&gt;Filling the void: As science journalism declines, scientists must rise up and reach out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main article is here: &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/full/458274a.html" title=""&gt;Science journalism: Supplanting the old media?&lt;/a&gt; (allows comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PDF is &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090318/pdf/458274a.pdf" title=""&gt;really pretty&lt;/a&gt; (and has additional images and boxes in the margins with quotes, numbers, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a part of doing research for this article, Geoff Brumfiel did a survey of a number of science journalists, and you can download the Excel spreadsheet with the responses &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/c38kp6" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People interviewed for the article and quoted within include &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/" title=""&gt;John Timmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;Larry Moran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/" title=""&gt;Carl Zimmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" title=""&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mikelemonick.com/" title=""&gt;Michael Lemonick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.corante.com/pipeline/" title=""&gt;Derek Lowe&lt;/a&gt; and myself, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to figure out what the figure is supposed to be illustrating, and what lesson is purportedly conveyed.  (Hint:  that’s supposed to be an egg.)  How hard can it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s a fruitful exercise, we can repeat for other figures, similarly inscrutable.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of the posts have sought to demonstrate that the exhausting cliché that scientists dismissed possible functions for non-coding DNA until recently is false.  Therefore, I have provided many quotes indicating that many (if not most) biologists continued to consider possible functions for various non-coding elements throughout the mythical period of neglect.  This time, I want to discuss an example in which a particular kind of non-coding sequence &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; considered as probably non-functional -- but because of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;knowledge about its biology&lt;/span&gt;, not because no function could be imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The elements under discussion are endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) which, as the name suggests, are viral-like sequences that exist within the genome.  Depending on who you ask, they are either very similar to or are interchangeable with long interspersed repeat (LTR) retrotransposons.  ERVs make up approximately 8% of the human genome, while LTR elements account for 50-80% of the maize genome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Endogenous retroviruses were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s (see &lt;a href="http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/67"&gt;Weiss 2006&lt;/a&gt;), but were first dubbed "endogenous viruses" by David Baltimore in 1974 (published in Baltimore 1975).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is how Baltimore (1975) explained their origin:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Evidence has accumulated that viruses have entered the germ line at various times during the ancestry of different species.  For convenience, two different cases can be considered: acquisition of viral genomes during inbreeding or domestication and acquisition of viral genomes during the evolution of a species.  In principle, viruses could have become part of an animal genome at any stage of evolution and still be detectable now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Baltimore (1975) discussed the fact that these "endogenous viruses" generally do not grow well in the species in which they had been identified, and that they often show signs of degrading by mutation.  Moreover, being clearly similar to viruses and sometimes causing diseases, it seemed very unlikely that they were maintained because they conferred some functional advantage to their hosts.  As he concluded,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is my guess that these viruses have no positive function to play in the life of the animals in which they are resident.  Rather, there is an evolutionary equilibrium balancing their acquisition and loss.  The viruses are being inserted into the germ line at very low frequency, after which they require many thousands or millions of years to be mutated away because they have little or no detrimental effect on the animal in which they are resident.  Viruses that did have a detrimental effect would be lost rapidly and might never come to our attention.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;It is worth noting that Baltimore (1975) does not cite Ohno (1972), makes no reference to "junk DNA", and reaches a tentative conclusion about lack of function from his consideration of the origin and properties of the elements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, some examples are known of ERVs with beneficial effects, such as in placental development (Mi et al. 2000) and p53 binding sites (Wang et al. 2007). (Note, however, that only 0.5% of identified ERVs are associated with binding sites).  As Weiss (2006) summarized the present situation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;As Mendelian elements, retroviruses must be subject to host selection. However, with the exception of enrolling &lt;em&gt;env &lt;/em&gt;genes in placental differentiation, ERV appear to be parasitic DNA sequences for which the host has little use, other than to protect against further retrovirus infection. Potentially, ERV can damage the host by mutational insertion and by homologous recombination. But despite a tendency to implicate ERV in many 'non-infectious' diseases in humans, there is scant evidence that they play a significant role. There are only rare examples where a recessive single gene disorder in a family lineage is caused by an endogenous retroviral insertion disrupting gene function.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Seems like Baltimore's (1975) assessment was largely correct with regard to mammalian ERV sequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;_________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baltimore, D.

A very quick summery of that argument is to ask why if the religious are so certain that dying will bring them to paradise, why do they fear death, avoid death, and morn those who have died as if their arrival in “a better place” were some kind of tragedy? I have yet to ever hear a convincing answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now a new study suggests that&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/03/18/religious_dying_patients_more_likely_to_get_aggressive_care/"&gt; dying medical patients who are the most religious are more likely to want aggressive care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients who leaned the most heavily on their faith were nearly three times more likely to choose and receive more aggressive care near death, such as ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. They were less likely to have advanced care planning in place, such as do-not-resuscitate orders, living wills, and healthcare proxies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results suggest that relying upon religion to cope with terminal cancer may contribute to receiving aggressive medical care near death,” the authors write in today’s Journal of the American Medical Association. “Because aggressive end-of-life cancer care has been associated with poor quality of death . . . intensive end-of-life care might represent a negative outcome for religious copers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this suggests that to some extent, there is also a paradox on the other side, where those more likely to see death as the end seem to be less inclined to get aggressive treatments. But maybe this is simply because those who don’t take much stock in an afterlife have simply resigned themselves to their fate and are less afraid to die. Though that’s just conjecture on my part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s kinda funny that evangelicals are always insisting atheists will have a change of heart on their death bed and when finally confronted with their death, will have a deathbed conversion. And while it seems few atheists have such conversions, this almost seems like the opposite, deeply religious people losing faith at the end of their lives and turning to science and reason to prolong their lives just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

Did he not stray too far from chalk, or did he go with the chalk all the way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinions on this subject were all over the news today. But what did it mean? Were they talking about our president's sometimes-professorial demeanor? Was he pale with rage at the AIG bonuses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you know who know the lingo of sports betting will recognize that the issue was the president's tendency to go with the favorites in filling out &lt;a href="http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2009/0317/obamasbracket09.jpg"&gt;his picks for the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. (In another example of emergent technical terminology, a completed set of tournament picks is known as a "bracket", and all over the country, people are filling out their brackets and submitting them to office betting pools or various higher-stakes entities. You can &lt;a href="http://ncaabracket.nytimes.com/bracket/men/"&gt;fill out your own bracket&lt;/a&gt; interactively at the New York Times in order to win an Amazon Kindle, for example.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Staten Island Advance headlined its (AP) story &amp;quot;All chalk on Obama&amp;#39;s tourney bracket&amp;quot;. But Newsday&amp;#39;s hed was &amp;quot;Barack Obama goes mostly chalk with NCAA bracket&amp;quot;. Dan Shanoff in the WSJ&amp;#39;s Daily Fix says that &amp;quot;President Obama didn’t stray too much from the chalk with most of his picks&amp;quot;, and specifically &amp;quot;went with the chalk all the way&amp;quot; in the Midwest — &amp;quot;not a single upset&amp;quot;. Shanoff&amp;#39;s comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Audacity of upsets: None. (With all due respect, Mr. President: Boo!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit of poking around on the web turns up some of the expected Runyonesque combinations (these are not commenting on the presidential bracket, and the last one is not even about basketball):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;When in doubt, go chalk city.&lt;br&gt;
West Virginia is a chalk-buster.&lt;br&gt;
Lawyer Ron won the Rebel, but none of my other chalk locks won.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the president&amp;#39;s first pick (Alabama State over Morehead State in the play-in) turned out to be wrong — but that was one of the cases where he strayed a bit from the chalk, since Morehead was favored by 3 points. Perhaps he was swayed by the unusual name of Alabama State&amp;#39;s center, Grlenntys Chief Kickingstallionsims Jr., the only 7′1″ Navajo in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president's NCAA bracket &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingsports/ci_11941163"&gt;fulfills a campaign promise&lt;/a&gt;. He filled it out for ESPN's SportsCenter show, where Andy Katz is a basketball analyst:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Katz interviewed Obama last October for a story about the president's brother-in-law, Oregon State basketball coach Craig Robinson. After the interview, Obama invited Katz to play in a pickup basketball game on Election Day in Chicago, and he did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Katz extracted a promise from Obama that if elected, the new president would reveal his NCAA picks to ESPN when the pairings were announced in March.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"They stayed true to their word and didn't hesitate to get it done," Katz said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama's approval rating remains high with Katz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"It was an educated bracket," Katz said. "He knew what he was doing. It wasn't some random kind of pick. There were no political favors or anything like that."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004859" title=""&gt;Is the New Primate Genus Rungwecebus a Baboon?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2005, a new primate species from Tanzania, the kipunji, was described and recognized as a member of the mangabey genus Lophocebus. However, molecular investigations based upon a number of papionins, including a limited sample of baboons of mainly unknown geographic origin, identified the kipunji as a sister taxon to Papio and not as a member of Lophocebus. Accordingly, the kipunji was separated into its own monotypic genus, Rungwecebus. We compare available mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data from the voucher specimen of Rungwecebus to other papionin lineages, including a set of geographically proximal (parapatric) baboon samples. Based on mitochondrial sequence data the kipunji clusters with baboon lineages that lie nearest to it geographically, i.e. populations of yellow and chacma baboons from south-eastern Africa, and thus does not represent a sister taxon to Papio. Nuclear data support a Papio+Rungwecebus clade, but it remains questionable whether Rungwecebus represents a sister taxon to Papio, or whether it is nested within the genus as depicted by the mitochondrial phylogeny. Our study clearly supports a close relationship between Rungwecebus and Papio and might indicate that the kipunji is congeneric with baboon species. However, due to its morphological and ecological uniqueness Rungwecebus more likely represents a sister lineage to Papio and experienced later introgressive hybridization. Presumably, male (proto-)kipunjis reproduced with sympatric female baboons. Subsequent backcrossing of the hybrids with kipunjis would have resulted in a population with a nuclear kipunji genome, but which retained the yellow/chacma baboon mitochondrial genome. Since only one kipunji specimen was studied, it remains unclear whether all members of the new genus have been impacted by intergeneric introgression or rather only some populations. Further studies with additional Rungwecebus samples are necessary to elucidate the complete evolutionary history of this newly-described primate genus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brother Consolmagno, who works in a Vatican observatory in Arizona and as curator of the Vatican meteorite collection in Italy, said a "destructive myth" had developed in modern society that religion and science were competing ideologies. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He described creationism, whose supporters want it taught in schools alongside evolution, as a "kind of paganism" because it harked back to the days of "nature gods" who were responsible for natural events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait…did a priest of one weird cult full of bizarre ideas just claim that another weird cult was full of bizarre ideas? He&amp;#39;s right, of course, but he seems to have a blind spot for his own superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, unfortunately, is complete bullshit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Religion needs science to keep it away from superstition and keep it close to reality, to protect it from creationism, which at the end of the day is a kind of paganism - it's turning God into a nature god. And science needs religion in order to have a conscience, to know that, just because something is possible, it may not be a good thing to do." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His religion &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a superstition, and I don&amp;#39;t believe for a moment that he wants science to keep it close to reality — if that were true, he&amp;#39;d be chucking out all those myths about triune gods, ritual cannibalism, magical transformations of crackers into holy meat, virgin births, miracles, yadda yadda yadda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tripe that religion provides a conscience is just a cliche…and one that is completely false. We&amp;#39;ve seen just in this past week that the Catholic church would rather that 9 year old girls die in childbirth, and that Africans should eschew protection from sexually transmitted disease in order to better follow the advice of ancient celibates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he wants to talk credibly about morality and conscience, first thing he needs to do is dump the evil archaic religion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/ive_got_irony_poisoning.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/US_EhEuh3LI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237423173731"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-5873788511394262401">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9b1b19288416bf1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="junk DNA" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Scitable again.</title><published>2009-03-19T00:18:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T00:26:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/rzEJ1hD06so/scitable-again.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=5873788511394262401" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/scitable-again.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">I noted previously that Scitable, a resource from Nature Education, was interesting but had some problems with the content [&lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/scitable-and-weird-piece-on-dna.html"&gt;Scitable (and a weird piece on DNA barcoding)&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, more troubles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Excerpt from &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Transposons-or-Jumping-Genes-Not-Junk-DNA-1211"&gt;Transposons, or Jumping Genes: Not Junk DNA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Transposable elements (TEs), also known as "jumping genes" or transposons, are sequences of DNA that move (or jump) from one location in the genome to another. Maize geneticist Barbara McClintock discovered TEs in the 1940s,&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt; and for decades thereafter, most scientists dismissed transposons as useless or "junk" DNA.&lt;/span&gt; McClintock, however, was among the first researchers to suggest that these mysterious mobile elements of the genome might play some kind of regulatory role, determining which genes are turned on and when this activation takes place (McClintock, 1965).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At about the same time that McClintock performed her groundbreaking research, scientists Roy Britten and Eric Davidson further speculated that TEs not only play a role in regulating gene expression, but also in generating different cell types and different biological structures, based on where in the genome they insert themselves (Britten &amp;amp; Davidson, 1969). Britten and Davidson hypothesized that this might partially explain why a multicellular organism has many different types of cells, tissues, and organs, even though all of its cells share the same genome. Consider your own body as an example: You have dozens of different cell types, even though the majority of cells in your body have exactly the same DNA. If every single gene was expressed in every single one of your cells all the time, you would be one huge undifferentiated blob of matter!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The early speculations of both McClintock and Britten and Davidson were largely dismissed by the scientific community. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Only recently have biologists begun to entertain the possibility that this so-called "junk" DNA might not be junk after all.&lt;/span&gt; In fact, scientists now believe that TEs make up more than 40% of the human genome (Smit, 1999). &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;It is also widely believed that TEs might carry out some biological function, most likely a regulatory on&lt;/span&gt;e—just as McClintock and Britten and Davidson speculated.

For more details, see &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=62"&gt;http://www.sciencedebate2008.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our government has also tried to stimulate the research / university sector in Canada, wishing to take important initiatives. At the heart of the plan is a $2 billion dollars infrastructure fund for shovel-ready renovation projects in post-secondary institutions, a fund that was actively solicited by university presidents. There is also an additional $750 million for the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and $87.5 million over three years for doctoral scholarships. While these funding announcements are surely welcome, we would like to share our concerns as to the potential effect of some of these decisions, in particular in view of the bold and visionary course taken by the Obama administration south of the border.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. When the U.S. government is proposing to boost the funding of the National Science Foundation (NSF) by 40% ($3 billion on top of its current $6.9 billion), we see Canada’s &amp;quot;stimulus budget&amp;quot; cutting NSERC&amp;#39;s by 5%. When the U.S. administration is proposing to boost the funding of the National Institute of Health (NIH) by 30% ($8.5 billion in addition to its current $29 billion), our &amp;quot;stimulus budget&amp;quot; is cutting CIHR&amp;#39;s by 5%, while essentially ignoring the needs of Genome Canada. When US researchers are being actively approached for ideas to use the stimulus money to think big and to hire and retain their researchers, their Canadian counterparts are now scrambling to identify budget cuts for their Labs, while worrying about the future of their graduating students. Recent Tri-council grants competitions, which were post stimulus budget, are already pointing towards sharply lower success rates (by more than 20% in some disciplines), lower start-up grants for young researchers, and negligible research funding for smaller institutions and provinces. These cuts are huge steps backward for Canadian Science and we ask the government to immediately develop a multi-year plan to significantly increase this country’s R&amp;amp;D investment through our granting councils.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. The infrastructure support for Canada's post-secondary institutions is surely beneficial for their depleted budgets for deferred maintenance. However, the federal support requires 50% in matching funds which few institutions currently have. The net effect of this decision will be to dictate priorities for universities and provincial governments too eager to get the federal funds, and as such to divert further funds from teaching, training and research. We therefore ask government to drop the requirement of matching funds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. The CFI has provided a tremendous boost to certain aspects of Canada's research infrastructure over the last 10 years. However, the constraints of the program have left many important research disciplines out of its potential beneficial impact. Moreover, similar matching rules continue to apply to CFI projects, and as a consequence of the present lack of available support from the private sector and from provincial governments, even some of the already approved projects are being postponed and cancelled. At this point in time, we believe that removing the matching requirements for current and future CFI projects would be extremely beneficial for Canada and its research infrastructure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. The funding of an additional 500 doctoral scholarships is great news for a country that is committed to have ``the best educated, most skilled and most flexible workforce in the world". However, it seems this funding is coming at the expense of the highly qualified personnel (HQP’s) that could have been recruited more efficiently by our senior researchers through their Tri-Council grants. We believe that a more efficient strategy for ensuring a successful HQP policy is to give our leading researchers the flexibility to manage the selection, recruitment, and support of their own graduate students through their peer-reviewed research grants, and via well-established leveraging procedures with the universities and the private sector. We also regret that the $17.5-million assigned to SSHRC for graduate scholarships have been earmarked towards students in business and finance. As Alain Dubuc writes in La Presse: ``En boudant certains domaines de recherche, nos universités vont perdre leur pouvoir d'attraction. Et bien des jeunes talentueux iront ailleurs.&lt;br&gt;(See &lt;a href="http://www.cyberpresse.ca/opinions/chroniqueurs/alain-dubuc/200903/06/01-833827-apres-les-artistes-les-chercheurs.php"&gt;http://www.cyberpresse.ca/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. President Obama is proposing to double federal funding for education over the next 10 years, and pledging to “restore science to its rightful place” with billions in new investments. To advise his government, he has appointed leading scientists to his cabinet and as his advisors (including a Nobel laureate as energy Secretary). The Obama administration has also involved the directors of NIH and NSF in federal budget discussions about the future of research. We need a similar approach in Canada, where top research scientists and humanists can help shape directions in Ottawa for research funding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new economy is coming out of this crisis and research and development will be the lifeblood to that new economy. We call upon you not to let Canada be left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Margaret Ann Armour, Chemistry, Order of Canada (University of Alberta) Tom Archibald, Chair of Mathematics (Simon Fraser University) Alejandro Adem, Mathematics (University of British Columbia) Tom Allison (University of British Columbia) Ali Arya, Information Technology (Carleton University) Peter Abrams, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (University of Toronto) Jim Arthur, Mathematics (University of Toronto) Marshall Agueh, Mathematics (University of Victoria) John Beamish, Chair, Physics (University of Alberta) Edward Bierstone, Mathematics (University of Toronto) Yaacov Ben-David, Biophysics (University of Toronto) Herman Brunner, Mathematics (Memorial University) Margaret Beattie, Mathematics (Mount Allison University) Peter Borwein, Mathematics (Simon Fraser University) Anne Bourlioux, Mathematics (Universite de Montreal) Hans U.

The case is being portrayed in the press as a religious conflict, in which the judge based his decision to deprive a mother of custody in part on the fact that she was teaching the children creationism. I suggested in my earlier post that the story sounded suspicious to me, largely because all we were given in the reports were quotes from the mother herself. We now have &lt;a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/content/media/2009/3/17/courtorder.pdf" rel="external "&gt;a written decision from the judge&lt;/a&gt; and it is clear that the original news story was, indeed, deeply misleading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we go out (to the grocery store, to the park, into a restaurant) people stare at my son quite a bit. He makes funny and very loud noises, gets aggressive  at times, behaves very differently and naturally draws a lot of attention. It is people's reaction, though, that makes the difference: whether they just turn their eyes away quickly, maybe even with a disgusted look on their face, or whether they are compassionate, giving an acknowledging smile or even offering help. I love my son and I would not want him any other way. He certainly is the joy of our life, and he helps us discover life in new and entirely unexpected ways every day. But still, life with a very severely affected autistic child is not always easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a good support system helps us very much. In school, my son has a one-on-one aide whom he has known for more than four years; also, our afternoon caretaker has worked with him for four years already. Altogether, we can provide comprehensive and consistent care. Since my son does not talk, we are working with picture and word cards, with a talker, as well as with time-related and spatial structuring methods. This has alleviated many problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My son loves his caretakers and they show great affection for him as well. I feel very good about the fact that he does not only focus on mom or dad, but learns to let other people into his life, and that he is a part of other people's lives as well. Hopefully, this will be quite helpful to him when he grows up. Like most parents with a severely disabled child, we think about the time when we might not be there for him anymore. I feel it is utterly important to equip him with the ability to live with others, to be part of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been proven beyond doubt that early intervention and good care can alleviate a lot of the problems that people with autism might have as children or might incur as adults. Intensive educational benefits therefore actually reduce future costs, which society might face when a person with autism has not been helped properly and is extremely difficult (and expensive) to care for as an adult. Let alone thinking of how happy or unhappy a person with autism can be, depending on how good he or she has been cared for and how much development of his or her abilities has been encouraged and appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to end with a recent uplifting personal experience which might underline the importance of proper support. For a long time, we have implemented PECS as a means of communication into our every-day life, but it remained a one-way street: we were showing our son what we were doing next, and he seemed to appreciate that, but he never took up his end of the rope to use the picture cards himself. Very slowly, after years of working on it (and I have to stress again that my son is very severely affected, so our progress is probably slower than that of a lot of other children with autism), we are now seeing him discover the world of communication. He is bringing the "kitchen" card, in school he gives his aide the "more" card at lunch when he wants a second helping, and at home he frequently brings the "bathing" card, a laminated photo of him sitting in the tub with the word "bathing" written underneath. He loves to take baths, so he might bring that card three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, I hid the card, because John had already taken a bath. He went to the drawer that contains all of his cards, and he was searching and searching. Previously, he might have gotten frustrated and aggressive. But he kept on searching and then proudly presented the card "swimming pool." Then he walked right up to the bathroom door with a smile on his face that seemed to say: "I won this one." Consider the cognitive effort: he had a desire, he decided to try and communicate this desire, he had to know what he was looking for, he had to deal with the fact that he wasn't finding it, he had to muster the patience to look for an alternative, and then he had the abstract understanding to realize that out of all cards the pool comes closest to the tub. Moreover, his triumphant smile suggested that he understands social interaction: it really seemed like he knew I didn't want him to take another bath (which I had also told him and his verbal understanding has gotten quite good), but he found a way to trick me into it, smart little guy. Of course, John was allowed the second bath then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very touched by John's progress and it makes me believe even stronger in demanding the best education for our children: a lot of frustration and aggression can be diverted this way, and be replaced by a happy boy who is very proud of his achievements.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Monika S.

COTW is handed out each Friday to a comment that has been nominated by a fellow commenter. To nominate your favorite comment, just quote it and write “COTW!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week’s winner was Expatria, who has shrewdly turned this opportunity into a giant plug for himself. Clever! Here’s his question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I decided to join the now near-ubiquitous social website Twitter (follow me, I’m awesome! http://twitter.com/jjuliano). I had been EXTREMELY resistant to doing so, at first, for a wide variety of good and not-so-good reasons, but eventually I could not resist and signed up. I’m pretty pleased with the decision, now, and I think Twitter has allowed me a small, 140-character entryway back to the sorely-neglected creative side of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience several years ago regarding the Harry Potter phenomenon, which I spent many years avoiding like the plague. I finally broke down when the trailers for the third movie actually looked, well, pretty good. I ended up reading all of the books, watching all of the movies, and even queueing up in London for the midnight release of the last book. I’m glad I opened my mind to the possibility I’d been missing something, although I recognize that it’s not always good to let one’s willpower be broken. These two cases are good, but surely many such indulgences lead to regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my question to you all is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What trends, fads, crazes, or other social phenomena have YOU resisted? And, more interestingly, which ones eventually broke down your resistances, for better or for worse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237413929600"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_testimonial_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c892c1fb21144460</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">A testimonial</title><published>2009-03-18T21:08:21Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T21:08:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/XLxBW8jgz6g/a_testimonial_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_testimonial_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not all of my email consists of metaphorical daggers hurled my way.

I am a Christian, and I don't think anybody asking a question about my religion is appropriate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We are evolving every year, every decade. That's a fact, whether it is to the intensity of the sun, whether it is to, as a chiropractor, walking on cement versus anything else, whether it is running shoes or high heels, of course we are evolving to our environment.

Now, right here in the very comments of this blog, Brian Deer has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/andrew_wakefield_strikes_back.php#comment-1476329"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, because Our Andy's statement purports to be a complaint to the UK Press Complaints Commission, I can't yet comment on the substance (although I have mentioned just a couple of generic Wakefield claims right up at the top, here: &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/solved/wakefield-veracity.htm"&gt;http://briandeer.com/solved/wakefield-veracity.htm&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;But, in general, my reaction is that I'm stunned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never before in my career in journalism have I seen so many assertions in a single complaint that can so easily be proven to be both (a) wrong and (b) dishonest. It's really very striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't, in fact, believe that his complaint is really targeted at the PCC, since it won't hear something that's in front of the GMC. Wakefield would know that. And he would also know that it won't hear something that hasn't been raised with the paper. This is all on the PCC website, and he and his people will have read that. Disingenuous in principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His strategy, in my opinion, is predicated on his personal and financial situation. This "complaint" is addressed to the narrowcasting of the web. He needs to get to parents of autistic children, to whom he may wish to suggest they should come to Austin with the kids, and to his bigger backers: particularly the money and reputations behind Thoughtful House. Through Kirby and Olmsted, he can get to those - perhaps a couple of thousand - people he wants to reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as ever, this is a short-term strategy, since much of what he says can be checked. For example his suggestion that his possible MMR-autism link allegation has been backed by other published research. He even cites papers. Thoughtful House people, and indeed anyone, can pull those papers, and form a judgment about his integrity. Similarly, he denies that his 1998 Lancet paper said the kids in his research paper (the one they are taking about here: &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/royal-free-press-1998.pdf"&gt;http://briandeer.com/mmr/royal-free-press-1998.pdf&lt;/a&gt;) were "previously normal" (Go on, have a look, you know you want to: &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.pdf"&gt;http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-paper.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His famed "charisma", will stand him in good stead for a while, as it did at the Royal Free, but history shows (eg with the whistleblower Nick Chadwick) it doesn't work with everyone, or forever. Eventually, people who know where any US bodies are buried will speak out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the unlikely event of the UK's General Medical Council continuing to have jurisdiction over him, I would guess that there is a straight, pretty much open-and-shut, dishonesty action against him over his statement, widely published to vulnerable parents, which I reckon could have him struck off in a five day hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it really beggars belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed it does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/brian_deer_responds_to_andrew_wakefield.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/vstDs34w2m4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237405770335"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5383882326313564964">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b020bb94d0bbcc1e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Goodyear's Bad Day</title><published>2009-03-18T19:45:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T19:49:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/goodyears-bad-day.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/5383882326313564964/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=5383882326313564964" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Here&amp;#39;s a link to Chris Selley&amp;#39;s article on The National Post website [Chris Selley&amp;#39;s Full Pundit: Goodyear&amp;#39;s bad day].

Your response to this question may reveal the degree to which you favor Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, no CAM treatment has been proven effective beyond placebo. (If you’re not convinced of this, I suggest you take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Snake-Oil-Science-Complementary-Alternative/dp/0195313682"&gt;Barker Bausell’s book&lt;/a&gt; on the subject.) That means that treatments like acupuncture, homeopathy, Reiki, energy healing, Traditional Chinese Medicine (such as cupping), and others (like “liver flushes”) perform about as well as placebos (inert alternatives) in head-to-head studies. Therefore, the effects of these treatments cannot be explained by inherent mechanisms of action, but rather the mind’s perception of their value. In essence, the majority of CAM treatments are likely to be placebo therapies, with different levels of associated ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, let’s assume that CAM therapies are in fact placebos – the question then becomes, is it ethical to prescribe placebos to patients?  It seems that many U.S. physicians believe that it is not appropriate to overstate potential therapeutic benefits to patients. In fact, the &lt;a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/369/ceja_recs_2i06.pdf"&gt;AMA strictly prohibits&lt;/a&gt; such a practice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physicians may use [a] placebo for diagnosis or treatment only if the patient is informed of and agrees to its use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a &lt;a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/344/21/1630"&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Outside the setting of clinical trials, there is no justification for the use of placebos.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is some wavering on the absolute contraindication of placebos. A &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/oct23_2/a1938"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by researchers at the Mayo Clinic asked physicians if it was permissible to give a dextrose tablet to a non-diabetic patient with fibromyalgia if that tablet was shown to be superior to no treatment in a clinical trial. In this case 62% of respondents said that it would be acceptable to give the pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before 1960, administration of inert substances to promote placebo effects or to satisfy patients’ expectations of receiving a prescribed treatment was commonplace in medical practice. With the development of effective pharmaceutical interventions and the increased emphasis on informed consent, the use of placebo treatments in clinical care has been widely criticized. Prescribing a placebo, it is claimed, involves deception and therefore violates patients’ autonomy and informed consent. Advocates of placebo treatments argue that promoting the placebo effect might be one of the most effective treatments available for many chronic conditions and can be accomplished without deception.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you feel about placebos? Are they a legitimate option in some cases, or a violation of patient autonomy and informed consent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally fall into the second category – I believe that willfully misleading patients is a violation of trust, and inappropriate in all cases. However, I respect the fact that some of my peers disagree, and feel that it’s sometimes ok to make a judgment call apart from the shared decision-making process. Perhaps some patients would like their doctors to do that for them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is something decidedly paternalistic about placebo-giving. The idea of willfully manipulating a patient’s perception of reality probably makes most providers squirm. And so this is why CAM proponents must contort themselves so as not to face the ethical conundrum that open acknowledgment of placebo treatment brings. The poorly designed studies, pseudoscientific explanations of mechanisms of action, and attempts to make plausible claims about implausible treatments are really just a way to maintain the “placebo effectiveness” of the therapy itself while shielding the prescriber from the ethical dilemma of compromising patient autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the only way to avoid paternalism and damage to patient self-determination is to convince oneself of the efficacy of the placebo. That exonerates the practitioner of guilt, because one doesn’t have to participate in willful manipulation of vulnerable people. And so, double-blind placeboism is the preferred way forward for practitioners who wish to offer unproven alternatives to effective medical therapies. Of course, this irritates scientists who seek an objective view of data – and who are not interested in using science to serve their preconceived notions. You may note that many of us here at &lt;em&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt; are none-too-thrilled about the cooptation of science for the purposes of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=394"&gt;“validating” personal beliefs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Are placebos unethical?  I suppose it’s debatable, but I am more comfortable with telling my patients the truth, and letting them decide what treatment options are best for them. To me, it’s not just the right thing to do – it’s the essence of patient empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, the Washington Post&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602139.html"&gt; just published an article&lt;/a&gt; on the connection between placebos and CAM.&lt;/p&gt;

I would never have expected such a dramatic turn-around. From out of nowhere, John Kwok surged out of fifth place in the field — I had written him off as a bad bet — to rally astonishingly by doing one simple thing: commenting. He clobbered Pete Rooke and Simon, even, just by writing one threat (to sic his facebook friends on me), and doing his usual irritating name-dropping nonsense. He showed real heart in this race, and I&amp;#39;m sure that if he just continues to babble, he will eventually win his place in the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/plonk.php"&gt;fabulous Pharyngula dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, he could not stop the juggernaut. One person stood out as a universal target for opprobrium by virtue of her homophobia and her cheerfully evil views. She was described as the Dolores Umbridge of Pharyngula. And for that reason, &lt;b&gt;Barb&lt;/b&gt; has been found unfit, and is cast into the dungeon for all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on Day Three of &lt;i&gt;Survivor: Pharyngula!&lt;/i&gt;, you get to vote on who you'd next like to evict. You may notice some changes in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africangenesis&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;s&gt;Barb&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Facilis&lt;br&gt;
John Kwok&lt;br&gt;
Piltdown Man&lt;br&gt;
Pete Rooke&lt;br&gt;
Silver Fox&lt;br&gt;
Simon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people on the first list who garnered little enthusiasm have been dropped. On the other hand, a few have been added. It&amp;#39;s a remarkable thing: these threads represent an opportunity for readers to vent their spleens over some of the more obnoxious commenters here, and thus represent a dangerous circumstance for the pesky little goblins — you&amp;#39;d think, if they had an sense at all, that they&amp;#39;d realize this is the time they should be lying low, keeping as quiet as possible. But no! I guess if they had any brains in the first place, they wouldn&amp;#39;t be quite as annoying. Maybe if I&amp;#39;d called this &lt;i&gt;Shark Week: Pharyngula!&lt;/i&gt;, they'd have realized that jumping into a well-chummed lagoon full of vicious beasts champing their razor-toothed jaws was not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now vote by leaving a comment here. Or, if you&amp;#39;d rather, you can always send the thread off in unusual directions — the last one seemed to be all about oral sex, lesbians, and bacon. I&amp;#39;ll tally the votes on Friday, if I can manage to pick them out of the non sequitur salad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about an immunity challenge for our contestants? Since the last runoff was characterized by an astonishing lack of self-awareness on the part of the &lt;s&gt;victims&lt;/s&gt; candidates, we should test that. The challenge for the seven surviving candidates is to write a short comment, 200 words or less, that reveals that they actually understand why their attitudes and pattern of expression have so exasperated readers here, and explains what they will do to change their behavior in the future. This will be a tough one for this crowd, I'm sure. Let's see if they can wake up enough to do some honest self-assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have until 1pm tomorrow to complete the immunity challenge, and then we'll open those up to the crowd for honest evaluation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_three.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/CQ_XSZfGsrw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237402014379"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=5767">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/668b319ca79f1423</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="economists"/><category term="Justin Wolfers"/><title type="html">New Editors at Brookings</title><published>2009-03-18T18:33:48Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T18:33:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/5xYXHfVzbXw/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/new-editors-at-brookings/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">O.K., I'll admit that I've done plenty of hand-wringing about the state of economics.

I gather he thinks I've been far too trusting as far as the information provided on the NCCAM website, and that I'm misrepresenting the issues the critics of NCCAM have with the center.  If my posts communicated that they were giving the straight dope on NCCAM and the objections to it, then I blew it; that wasn't at all what was intended.  Rather, I wanted to have a look at the ethical issues that arise from such an official effort to examine medical treatments that are not part of the mainstream, and to start to tease out how these might be connected to broader issues around the interactions between scientifically grounded health care providers and patients who are not adherents to scientific ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, let me reiterate that &lt;b&gt;I am not an expert on NCCAM or the movement to get broad acceptance for alternative medical treatments&lt;/b&gt;.  Rather, I'm trying to understand the political battles in terms of the divergent ways of understanding the world driving the participants in these battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taylor, Ronald,  Carter, Barbara. 1976.  &lt;strong&gt;Entertaining With Insects.  Or:  The Original Guide to Insect Cookery. &lt;/strong&gt;Santa Barbara, Calif.:  Woodbridge Press Publ. Co., 160 pp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone out there have a copy? Can you send me the recipe for John the Baptist Bread?  I’m supposed to be doing a 4-H workshop this weekend, and can’t find the recipe online.&lt;strong&gt; Help! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I remember is that you roast crickets (since locusts are hard to come by in Michigan), grind them into flour (a coffee grinder is excellent for this, but you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; find the odd tarsi in your beans later on), and mix it with lots of honey to make a very nice little cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the bread comes from a passage in Mark 1.6: &lt;em&gt;“And John was dressed with the hairs of a camel and with a belt of skins around his loins, and he ate locusts and wild honey.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, exactly, John the Baptist really ate is a subject of a lot more scholarly study than I had imagined.  There is what appears to be a review on the topic &lt;a href="http://cbi.sagepub.com/cgi/content/refs/2/1/104"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;; also a LONG pamphlet called &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uzTcB8yMnrcC&amp;amp;pg=PA107&amp;amp;lpg=PA107&amp;amp;dq=john+baptist+bread+recipe+crickets&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=7pCIcNe0wX&amp;amp;sig=Yt14ylZc_dgi_qNYpdk24kk5dpY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=1zPBSf_mA4vEM9zo_bIN&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;“The Diet of John the Baptist”&lt;/a&gt; online at Google Books, and much more if you care to use your Google-Fu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some authors take a rather entomophobic approach that it was the locust &lt;em&gt;tree&lt;/em&gt;, not actual locusts, that were eaten.  However, this ignores the long tradition of eating locusts in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sticking with the &lt;a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/73"&gt;Orthopteran&lt;/a&gt; explanation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, the Food Insect Site has a &lt;a href="http://www.food-insects.com/books_on_insects_as_food.htm"&gt;List of cookbooks for Entomophagous folks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He got a lot of flak from this, both in the Globe and Mail, which broke the story, and by the blogs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course I do,” he told guest host Jane Taber during an appearance on the CTV program Power Play. “But it is an irrelevant question.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m calling shenanigans on him. Why? Because 1) he should have answered it in the first place — if, by his reasoning,  the question was irrelevant yesterday, it still is today, and 2) it is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; relevant question, given that he was couching his answers yesterday in religious terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I pointed out in my post yesterday, religion is irrelevant only if it doesn’t affect the job. But as we have seen over the past 8 years in the US, religion does indeed have a tendency to affect people’s decisions, especially, critically, if they are a creationist. Then it colors everything they do, including trying to overthrow the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is Canada and not the United States we’re talking about here, so the ground rules legally are different. But tell me, how would you feel if &lt;del&gt;the head of&lt;/del&gt; an official in your federal science department told you he believes the Earth is flat? Or the Sun revolves around the Earth? Or that he thinks the sky is a great crystal sphere, and he lies awake at night worried that the Voyager probes will smash it and let all our air out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those beliefs have just as much basis as young Earth creationism: they are faith-based only, and have no evidence for them, and about a billion solid pieces of evidence against them. If your science advisor told you any of those things, you’d think he was crazy and you’d look for a replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, you’re darn tootin’ this is a relevant question. And for him to say otherwise is a denial of reality both politically and, well, realistically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly hope his equivocal answer isn’t the last of this situation. Canadian scientists and politicians need to continue to look at Dr. Goodyear very carefully.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237398527639"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/pat_condell_doesnt_hold_back.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2a0ad9f2ed07b103</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Pat Condell doesn't hold back</title><published>2009-03-18T18:08:36Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T18:08:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/I9n7Cqah5Xk/pat_condell_doesnt_hold_back.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/pat_condell_doesnt_hold_back.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/8bzTA_D5NpU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/pat_condell_doesnt_hold_back.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/I9n7Cqah5Xk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237398502612"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/intellectual_and_developmental_disabilities_awareness_month">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8751ba4962b8e7e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month</title><published>2009-03-18T17:46:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T17:46:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/intellectual_and_developmental_disabilities_awareness_month" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/helios89/1360757052/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1129/1360757052_a551272cf9_m.jpg" alt="big words painted on a large wall that read &amp;#39;respect and diversity in our community&amp;#39;" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;March is Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Awareness month, and it seems different states have different themes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme in Ohio is "&lt;a href="http://jfactivist.typepad.com/jfactivist/2009/03/march-is-mrdd-awareness-month-.html"&gt;Just Like You&lt;/a&gt;," quote from that article "Just like You encourages people to bring diversity to their communities by welcoming people with disabilities into local neighborhoods, workplaces, houses of worship and schools..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my state the theme is one I like even better, "&lt;a href="http://ocdd.org/index.php/ocdd/whatwedo/14/"&gt;GET INFORMED, GET INVOLVED, GET RESULTS!&lt;/a&gt;"  The governor of Oregon has made &lt;a href="http://ocdd.org/doc_downloads/Developmental_Disabilities_Awareness_0309.pdf"&gt;a proclamation (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; which I quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS: Developmental disability is a natural part of the human experience, affecting nearly 37,000 Oregon children and adults; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS: All people with developmental disabilities can be productive, contributing members of their communities; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS: Many people with developmental disabilities rely on publicly funded services and supports in order to fully participate in community life; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS: During times of economic decline, essential services and supports for people with developmental disabilities are often threatened; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS: The power of people with disabilities is strongest when their voices are united; and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHEREAS: Policy makers can only make good public policy when they hear from the people directly affected by their decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOW, &lt;br&gt;
THEREFORE: I, Theodore R. Kulongoski,Governor of the State of Oregon,hereby proclaim March 2009 to be DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AWARENESS MONTH in Oregon and encourage all Oregonians to join in this observance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I look toward April's impending brand of "awareness" with dread, I also look toward the larger developmental disabilities community with appreciation and a desire to learn.  That larger community has been successful in ensuring that "awareness," at least for March, means awareness of civil rights, humanity, ability, and empowerment for myself and those like me.  Not pity and doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with one specific developmental disability label (autism) must not be excluded from the civil rights and respect granted to people with all other developmental disability labels--Kulongoski's statement is true for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of us who are classified as developmentally disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will claim the empowering awareness message of March as my own and forget April, thanks.  And hope continued work by the larger developmental disabilities community in conjunction with autistic self-advocates can bring "awareness" about autism into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237397698342"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_need_for_advocacy_in_germany">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0f3e3204bdb9aff2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">On the Need For Advocacy in Germany</title><published>2009-03-18T17:31:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T17:31:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_need_for_advocacy_in_germany" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="one-way-up sign" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/one-way-up-225x300.jpg" height="300" alt="one way up" width="225"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This and another post today continue our series of writing by international guest bloggers. Monica previously wrote about &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/educating_children_with_autism_in_germany"&gt;educating children with autism in Germany&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/adulthood_and_more_for_people_on_the_spectrum_in_germany"&gt;adulthood and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a child with autism is not and should not be about finances. Knowing that my son's special needs are fully taken care of financially by the health insurance and the government is a great relief to me. Since I don't have to spend money on any autism-related services, I feel I can concentrate on my son's development and well-being, and on the quality of our family life. We are currently doing very well, but I should mention that we only got there by strong advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if there are a lot of services and benefits, it does not mean that one gets them automatically. Government officials, the heads of school boards and health insurance employees naturally try to save as much as they can. As a parent, I have to investigate my rights and see to it that they get fulfilled. This is not easy for just any parent. Some people find it difficult to educate themselves, to stand up against officials with big job titles etc. This is another reason why we have founded our &lt;a href="http://www.elternzentrum-berlin.de/"&gt;parent organization in Berlin&lt;/a&gt;: next to raising awareness, fostering advocacy, and training teachers and caretakers, we also want to help families who do not receive proper services, just because they do not know how to get them. One example: my son benefits immensely from his one-on-one aide in school, but in his class is another girl with autism who does not have a one-on-one aide. Her parents are from Africa and do not speak German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example: my son is being treated by a child psychiatrist with a very good reputation. He has many patients with autism and is very experienced. When we first went to see him, my son had already been disgnosed with autism several years prior. We entered his office and twenty minutes into our visit, he turned to me and said: "Well, I don't even think I need to see your son's diagnostic paperwork anymore. This must be the most obvious, clear-cut case of autism I have seen. Right out of the book." Yet, when my son's school placement was evaluated, the school board tried to code him "cognitively challenged" rather than under the "autism" code. Autism qualifies for more benefits, and the board was trying to save. I had to fight to get the autism code – and I know a few parents who did not win that fight, even though their child has a proper diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, this is one of the reasons why the question of autism prevalence is a murky and messy issue in Germany. Studies which go by school codes really aren't representative. So while everyone knows that more children are being diagnosed – mainly due to better knowledge of doctors and a broader spectrum understanding – we do not have any reliable official numbers.)&lt;br&gt;
Up until my son was two years old, we lived in the U.S. and we experienced a great amount of compassion by other people. Here in Germany, people in public seem to be colder. Admittedly, this could also be due to my son's growing: he simply isn't the odd-but-cute little toddler anymore. But I feel in general that society is more tolerant and accepting in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it a coincidence that the U.S. is lesser known for its social security system, but more so as a nicer society? Maybe people are more compassionate in the U.S. because they know that families with an autistic child face a lot of difficulties and have to manage these difficulties in a self-reliant way. In Germany, on the contrary, everyone knows that families with an autistic child get extensive services, receive a lot of benefits, and that their children go to schools which cost the taxpayer dearly. I think this allows people to cultivate a detached mentality, as in: "They get all they need, they are well taken care of, so why should I get involved. It's none of my business, my duty is fulfilled by the taxes I pay." The segregrating effect of children with disabilities mostly attending special schools and adults mostly living and working in special facilities might contribute to the distance, which the so-called normal people feel (and like to keep for their own comfort).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Monika S.

&lt;p&gt;It really helps the Open Lab project if a lot of people have handy little 'submit to Open Lab' buttons/badges on their side-bars. More blogs have it, the better. Just one click, and the entry is submitted (instead of coming here and searching for the link).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I asked for new button designs and got more than one to choose from.  Instead of choosing one myself, I thought I'd ask the hive-mind: which one do you like the best so we can turn it into the 'official' design? Suggest changes to designs as well. Post your vote in the comments and in 5 days I will tally them up and post the codes for the winning design in several different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This button was designed by &lt;a href="http://marmorkrebs.org" title=""&gt;Zen Faulkes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, I consider it not only to be a boondoggle that wastes the taxpayers' money &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/the_national_center_for_complementary_an.php"&gt;funding pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;, but a key promoter of quackery. Worse, its promotion of highly implausible (one might even say magical) modalities gives these modalities a patina of scientific respectability that they do not deserve, especially given that, even under the most favorable conditions possible, they routinely fail to demonstrate any efficacy above and beyond that of a placebo control. Indeed, as I've emphasized time and time again, often such therapies appear to show efficacy in smaller pilot studies, which are not as rigorously controlled, but fail to show any efficacy above that of a placebo in larger, better-designed randomized trials. Indeed, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=acupuncture+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; is the prototypical example, as is &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=homeopathy+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article from Monday in the &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602139.html"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; leads me to believe that the mainstream media may finally be catching on. It isn't perfect, but it's better than any straight reporting I've seen on the issue in a long time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money is giving a group of scientists an opening to make a once-unthinkable proposal: Shut down the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.

&lt;p&gt;The notion that the world's best-known medical research agency sponsors studies of homeopathy, acupuncture, therapeutic touch and herbal medicine has always rankled many scientists. That the idea for its creation 17 years ago came from a U.S. senator newly converted to alternative medicine's promise didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although NCCAM has a comparatively minuscule budget and although it is a "center" rather than an "institute," making it officially second-class in the NIH pantheon, the principle is what mattered. But as NIH's budget has flattened in recent years, better use for NCCAM's money has also become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's rare to find an article in a mainstream news source begin with such a blunt statement of what we critics have been saying about NCCAM for years. Dr. Wally Sampson, for instance, is as far as I know the first who openly called for the &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html"&gt;defunding of NCCAM&lt;/a&gt;, and he did this back in 2002. These calls have recently gained new force given how CAM advocates are currently trying very hard to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_three_musketeers_of_woo_meet_dartagn.php"&gt;tie the legitimization of CAM&lt;/a&gt; to whatever health care reform legislation President Obama tries to get through the Congress, camouflaging it under the cloak of legitimate treatment modalities such as "diet and exercise," "health maintenance," and "prevention."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_justification_for_nccam_what_can_be.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_justification_for_nccam_what_can_be.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/uBb10WGMd1Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237395438044"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6492">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5d434ff449dcd78b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 3.18</title><published>2009-03-18T13:00:02Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T13:00:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6492" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Can I explain them away? What do I think about these claims? Here's the email and my response:&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many people say they have experienced the supernatural - receiving a miracle, hearing God speak to them, etc. Pastors such as Mark Driscoll write about their experience with prophetic dreams, seeing demonic attacks, etc. (His book "Confessions of a Reformission Rev detail these things). I have a friend who goes to a Christian school, and tells of the time they prayed for a girl with a broken foot - the next day, it was healed.  She didn't have to wear her cast anymore, she was walking fine, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be easiest to say that they are lying, making these stories up - but I know my friend, and have no reason to think he would make up a story like that (He's not charismatic, and has never claimed to have seen any other "miracles").  Additionally, I have verified this story of the "healed foot" - everyone claims it really happened.  Still, it's tough for me to fully trust this, as I have never personally seen this kind of supernatural event take place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously, people from other religions claim to experience this too - it doesn't seem to be limited to Christianity, although the large majority of miraculous stories/healings are found in the Christian faith.  Would you tend to believe that most/all of these experiences are fictional?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, at this point in my journey, I just want to know the truth - which is what drew me to you, as I know you are after truth as well.  I'm sure you have thought about the claims of supernatural experience, so if you could offer any insight into this area, I would greatly appreciate it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;In part here is my response:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not an answer man. There are mysteries to life, true, and precisely because they exist there will always be room for faith. So I usually tell them that if I had the same experience they had then I would probably believe too. The question is why I don't? I do know that people count the hits and discount the misses, and that people of faith want to see a miracle, which might incline them to see one. I also tell people that even as a Pentecostal in my former years I never saw a miracle and that's all I can say about my personal experiences, for if God didn't supply one then, why should I expect him to now? &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I also ask them why God does these miracles for some people and not for others who die miserable deaths. And then I ask why people of other faiths also report these kinds of things.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;On religious experiences &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/01/testing-religious-experience-by.html"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On faith healers you must see &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianright.blogspot.com/2009/01/cnn-documentary-on-gods-warriers.html"&gt;this documentary&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;On the power of brain manipulation you must see &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ02I6QyagM"&gt;this from Derren Brown&lt;/a&gt; (I recommend episodes 2-4 especially).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------------&lt;br&gt;I hope this helps, and I hope others who are troubled by these kinds of unexplained phenomena look through each of the links provided above to decide for themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-5395426449279679203?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

That's a fact, whether it is to the intensity of the sun, whether it is to, as a chiropractor, walking on cement versus anything else, whether it is running shoes or high heels, of course we are evolving to our environment. But that's not relevant and that is why I refused to answer the question. The interview was about our science and tech strategy, which is strong.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He's not talking about evolution as it is understood by scientists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can understand why Goodyear says such things.  He has no real understanding of modern science.  What almost bothers me more is the statement from Marc Garneau, the Liberal science critic, who was an astronaut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is a personal matter. It is a matter of faith.… I don't think it prevents someone from being a good minister.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If this is the alternative, we are in very dire straights.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-2654489758554370523?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/l8Vhc_r33NQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237390744857"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-8888521379519844509">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bab70e03efb81522</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Obama's statements about science.</title><published>2009-03-18T11:43:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T11:46:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/149O3xx-0wY/obamas-statements-about-science.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=8888521379519844509" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/obamas-statements-about-science.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">From &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126995.000-europe-plays-catchup-to-obamas-science-drive.html"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;, some quotes of President Obama's:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"My administration will not deny facts, we will be guided by them."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Science holds the key to our survival as a planet and our security and prosperity as a nation.

Many scientists have welcomed this move, but are concerned about the simultaneous cuts that are being inflicted on basic research grants.  With no money for operating, what use is a nice new lab?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another question was recently raised by a colleague that I think is important to consider.  The CFI generally funds 40% of a proposed program.  Another 40% comes as match from the province, and 20% in match (e.g., in-kind) from suppliers.  The question is, will the new federal funds require equal match from the provinces, and if so, have the provinces got the money?  If there is no match around, then that substantial new investment may never go anywhere.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-7923051201902918096?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/wOd_j-5gjaU" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237390378950"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/18/cracked-fallacies/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f64ce9c55106d34a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Cracked fallacies</title><published>2009-03-18T15:30:40Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T15:30:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/18/cracked-fallacies/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The website cracked.com is becoming a favorite of mine. Of course, a lot of the humor is childish — it’s Cracked, duh — but there is a core of wisdom and truth to their posts that attracts me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today they posted &lt;a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_17142_5-ways-common-sense-lies-you-everyday.html"&gt;5 Ways ‘Common Sense’ Lies To You Everyday&lt;/a&gt; which is actually a pretty good introduction to this particular flavor of uncritical thinking. It uses humor and a good grasp of current stuff that’s hip (and some fairly NSFW things too, just so’s you know) to show you just why what you’re thinking is probably wrong, or at least under the influence of forces you may not be aware of. And, they use asteroid impacts as an example. Score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many people have said, common sense is neither. This article may actually help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Plotycia was abroad, Weyer&amp;#39;s stepmother and paternal grandmother became concerned about
conditions at Cross Creek.  When Plotycia returned to the U.S., he went
to visit Cross Creek and his son.  Plotycia determined to remove his
son from this facility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Plotycia interviews &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/abusive-teen-programs-2009-deposition-from-a-parent.html"&gt;are here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is a six-part interview, each about 10 minutes long, with Casey Weyer, who describes his experiences at Cross Creek Manor.

The interviewer, as before, appears to be Mrs. Plotycia's pastor.


&lt;strong&gt;Part I&lt;/strong&gt; -- Casey Weyer describes how he got to Cross Creek Manor&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/fkTAReSOvQs%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Part II&lt;/strong&gt; -- Casey Weyer describes of "Group therapy" offered at Cross Creek, how he was forced to write a "confession letter" he believed would be confidential between his counselor and himself, which was then sent to his mother and stepfather, being labelled with diagnoses that did not fit his behavior, and punishments, including solitary confinement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/eWGQ3mLERrw%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Part III&lt;/strong&gt; -- Casey Weyer gives a fuller description of the solitary confinement pubnishment, called "Special Needs" (SN) at Cross Creek, and describes the very deficient academic program at Cross Creek. Weyer describes how any negative communication against the program would be labelled "manipulation" and "lying" and would be punished. Weyer explains how children in the program are encouraged to exploit other students' behavior for their own betterment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/elOTfv6ncB4%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Part IV&lt;/strong&gt; -- Casey Weyer describes another student's gruesome suicide attempt and Cross Creek Manor's callous indifference to the student. Another incident of callous indifference is described as a group therapy counselor takes a phone call in group. Children at Cross Creek were threatened with being sent to &lt;a href="http://www.isaccorp.org/tranquilitybay.asp"&gt;Tranquility Bay, Jamaica&lt;/a&gt;. This video also describes Casey's response to the arrival of his father and stepmother. He was originally cautious, as he was afraid he was being set up for punishment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Part V&lt;/strong&gt;In this segment, Casey Weyer goes into more detail about his father and stepmother's visit, and why he did not believe he would be allowed to leave Cross Creek with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Part VI--Casey Weyer describes the "mind control" aspects of the Cross Creek experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Mistakes were made at AIG, and on a scale that few could have imagined possible. The most egregious of those began in 1987, when the company strayed from its core insurance competencies to launch a credit-default-swaps portfolio, which eventually became subject to massive collateral calls that created a liquidity crisis for AIG. Its missteps have exacted a high price, not only for the company and its employees but for the American taxpayer, the federal government's finances and the global economy. These missteps brought AIG to the brink of collapse and to the government for help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The phrase &amp;quot;mistakes were made&amp;quot; is simple enough to be common — especially if minor variants like &amp;quot;mistakes have been made&amp;quot; are counted — and evasive enough to be be salt in the wounds of angry people eager for contrition and even revenge. The fact that it has its own &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistakes_were_made"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; is evidence of its special status, as is the fact that (back in 1991) William Safire &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D81039F937A25754C0A967958260&amp;amp;pagewanted=2"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt; William Schneider's joke-grammar coinage &lt;em&gt;past exonerative&lt;/em&gt; to describe it.  When Alberto Gonzales used the phrase two years ago, the NYT teased him with a historical review under the headline "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/14/washington/14mistakes.html"&gt;Familiar Fallback for Officials: 'Mistakes were Made'&lt;/a&gt;". The most widely-remarked example, I think, was Ronald Reagan's reference to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Contra_Affair"&gt;Iran-Contra scandal&lt;/a&gt; in his 1987 State of the Union address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that this is was the instance that led to the Matt Groening &lt;em&gt;Life in Hell&lt;/em&gt; strip, shown above (click for a larger version).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to reporters on his way to Cameroon's capital, Yaounde, the Pope said HIV/Aids was "a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which can even increase the problem".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The solution lies in a "spiritual and human awakening" and "friendship for those who suffer", the AFP news agency quotes him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consistent condom use is associated with a reduction in the incidence of HIV infection of approximately &lt;i&gt;80%&lt;/i&gt;. It does not increase the problem. I know the Catholic church is reliant on the denial of human nature, something demonstrated regularly by the activities of its own priests, but at some point they have to recognize a simple reality: people like to have sex. You aren't going to talk them out of it without warping their psychology in a truly pathological way (again, witness the Catholic priesthood), but you &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be able to get them to practice sex in a way that protects their health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claiming that condoms increase the problem is disinformation and outright quackery — it&amp;#39;s a lie that will kill people. That is what the pope is doing on his little tour, spreading lies, doing harm, and setting back efforts to materially help the afflicted. &amp;quot;Friendship&amp;quot; won&amp;#39;t help the children of a woman dying slowly of AIDS, nor will gilt-robed old men whispering about &amp;quot;spirituality&amp;quot; do one scrap of good against a dangerous reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_pope_is_an_evil_quack.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Kje_8VS5H6s" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237385897820"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/those_who_believe_in_heaven_ar.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7189908de653dc6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">Those who believe in heaven are least likely to want to go there</title><published>2009-03-18T14:02:11Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T14:02:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/suTIZ90zBYY/those_who_believe_in_heaven_ar.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/those_who_believe_in_heaven_ar.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I find the results of this study to be simply sad, but entirely unsurprising. An examination of dying cancer patients showed that &lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/03/18/religious_dying_patients_more_likely_to_get_aggressive_care/"&gt;the most religious were also the most likely to ask for very aggressive medical care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients who leaned the most heavily on their faith were nearly three times more likely to choose and receive more aggressive care near death, such as ventilators or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. They were less likely to have advanced care planning in place, such as do-not-resuscitate orders, living wills, and healthcare proxies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"These results suggest that relying upon religion to cope with terminal cancer may contribute to receiving aggressive medical care near death," the authors write in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. "Because aggressive end-of-life cancer care has been associated with poor quality of death . . . intensive end-of-life care might represent a negative outcome for religious copers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most religions are built on fear and ignorance, so we shouldn&amp;#39;t be at all surprised to find that these dying people respond to their situation with great fear, and with little planning or thought. I don&amp;#39;t even think it&amp;#39;s because religion tells people to ignore their wills or to seek the most excessive (and ultimately, futile) medical attention — this is a property of the kind of people who seek out religion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/those_who_believe_in_heaven_ar.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/suTIZ90zBYY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237385897820"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/what_the_heck_is_wrong_with_yo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ff0f2c2887338120</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">What the heck is wrong with you, Australia?</title><published>2009-03-18T13:33:27Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T13:33:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Hybi4lY1z8k/what_the_heck_is_wrong_with_yo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/what_the_heck_is_wrong_with_yo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Australian government is trying to censor the internet.

This is similar to evidence-based medicine (EBM), although we quibble about the relative roles of evidence vs prior plausibility. In a &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=497"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; 86% of Americans said they thought that science education was “absolutely essential” or “very important” to the healthcare system. So there seems to be general agreement that science is a good way to determine which treatments are safe and work and which ones are not safe or don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for SBM also stems from an understanding of human frailty - there are a host of psychological effects and intellectual pitfalls that tend to lead us to wrong conclusions.  Even the smartest and best-meaning among us can be lead astray by the failure to recognize a subtle error in logic or perception. In fact, coming to a reliable conclusion is hard work, and is always a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also huge pressures at work that value things other than just the most effective healthcare. Industry, for example, is often motivated by profit. Institutions and health care providers may be motivated by the desire for prestige in addition to profits. Insurance companies are motivated by cost savings. Everyone is motivated by a desire to have the best health possible - we all want treatments that work safely, often more so than the desire to be logical or consistent. And often personal or institutional ideology comes into play - we want health care to validate our belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conflicting motives create a disconnect in the minds and behaviors of many people. They pay lip service to science-based medicine, but are good at making juicy rationalizations to justify what they want to be true rather than what the science supports. We all do this to some degree - but, in my opinion, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a cultural institution that is built upon these rationalizations.  It is formalized illogic and anti-science conceals as science under a mountain of rationalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some recent news items and reports dealing with &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=362"&gt;acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate this disconnect quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BMJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British Medical Journal (BMJ) recently published a &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/338/jan27_2/a3115?maxtoshow=&amp;amp;HITS=10&amp;amp;hits=10&amp;amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;amp;fulltext=ACUPUNCTURE&amp;amp;searchid=1&amp;amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;amp;resourcetype=HWCIT%2013"&gt;review of acupuncture studies&lt;/a&gt; in the treatment of chronic pain. Like most other reviews of acupuncture studies, the authors were not impressed. They concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found, which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly distinguished from bias. Whether needling at acupuncture points, or at any site, reduces pain independently of the psychological impact of the treatment ritual is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After decades of study and hundred of clinical trials, this remains the state of acupuncture research.  The best studies continue to show an unclear effect, which cannot be separated from bias - which of course is the point of clinical trials. In other words, the signal cannot be separated from the noise. The most parsimonious interpretation of this fact is that there is no significant signal - acupuncture does not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But supporters of acupuncture prefer to go through a litany of rationalizations rather than acknowledge that simple fact (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also recently announced that the BMJ group will be adding a new journal: BMJ Acupuncture. That’s right, an entire journal dedicated to studying (read “promoting”) acupuncture.  The &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/128867.php"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acupuncture in Medicine&lt;/em&gt; is a quarterly title, which aims to build the evidence base for acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the purpose of research was to discover &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;a treatment works, not to build a case for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMJ is a strange journal - it is generally of high quality but seems to have a blind spot for certain CAM modalities, like acupuncture. While it will publish critical reviews, like the one above, it also has published some low quality positive reviews - such as &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/bmj.39471.430451.BEv1"&gt;this one of acupuncture and IVF &lt;/a&gt;(in vitro fertilization).  The review glosses over the disparity in study quality and location. &lt;a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/125438.php"&gt;Other reviews &lt;/a&gt;published around the same time showed no effect from acupuncture in IVF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best individual studies to date show no effect. In fact, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18940896?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=1&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;the most recent study&lt;/a&gt; showed that the placebo acupuncture group had slightly higher pregnancy rates by some measures than the acupuncture group (while other measures showed no difference). Again - the most parsimonious interpretation of this study is the null hypothesis - acupuncture does not work in IVF. But proponents twisted themselves into logical pretzels and offered up the astounding rationalization that placebo acupuncture must have some real effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I am not against journals that specialize in one area, or practitioners that specialize in one form of treatment. Specialization is essential to deal with the modern complexity of medicine. However, we must recognize the significant risk of specialization - and that is the fallacy that is often summarized as follows: if your only tool is a hammer then every problem will look like a nail. It is unlikely that a journal or practitioner dedicated to acupuncture will ever reach the conclusion that acupuncture is a dead end and science-based medicine should move on. As an extension of this, specialty journals and specialist should follow well-established modalities. Forming a specialty journal dedicated to an unproven and dubious modality is problematic, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Rationalizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602018_2.html?sid=ST2009031602287"&gt;Washington Post article&lt;/a&gt; observes in its headline: “Millions embrace acupuncture, despite thin evidence.” It seems this reporter, Ellen Edwards, has grasped the essential disconnect, although she does not sufficiently explore an answer to the implied question - why? Why do so many accept acupuncture despite an enduring absence of scientific evidence? Ironically, the press has much to do with it. They are often complicit in misrepresenting the facts, and abetting the rationalizations that are necessary for those who should know better to continue to promote acupuncture despite the lack of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some professional organizations are also complicit. The article notes, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Medical Association takes no position specifically on acupuncture; the AMA groups it with other alternative treatments, saying “there is little evidence to confirm the safety or efficacy of most alternative therapies.” It says “well-designed, stringently controlled research” is needed to evaluate its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the AMA is not the best place to go for position papers on specific scientific questions in medicine. But if they are going to bother having any position, it should be better informed. They say that research is needed, giving the impression that there isn’t already a large body of research to inform out opinion about whether acupuncture works or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion that more research is needed is one of the most common rationalizations. That allows someone to put off forever concluding that their pet modality does not work - simply make the case for more research, which is easy to make sound like it’s a good idea. And of course anyone against more research must be closed-minded.  For example, the story relates (standard disclaimer - I am aware that experts are often quoted out of context by journalists, so keep that in mind, but for the purposes of this post I will take the quotes at face value):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, NCCAM spent about $9.1 million on acupuncture research. While more is planned, Brent Bauer, an internist at the Mayo Clinic and director of its complementary and alternative medicine program, said the research is in its “toddlerhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice touch - “toddlerhood.”  That’s just a cute way of saying that more research is needed and you can comfortably ignore any current negative research. If the assessment were fair, then it could be justified. But we have already had several fairly sophisticated placebo-acupuncture controlled trials. This represents reasonably mature clinical research. I suspect&lt;br&gt;
Bauer just does not like the fact that these best studies (like the IVF study above) are generally negative. I wonder - if these studies were positive would he still think they were imature and could be ignored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Lee, a gastroenterologist who is director of Johns Hopkins’s new Integrative Medicine and Digestive Center, is quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have this double standard. We are completely comfortable using pharmacological therapies that have not been subjected to clinical trials for the purposes we use them, but we are super suspicious of alternative therapies that haven’t been tested with randomized placebo trials. From a research point of view, I understand the criticism. But we physicians are in the healing business, and we have to go beyond the pharmacological solutions to understand the whole person,” she said. “Acupuncturists start with the whole person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah - the “holistic” gambit.  This is just another rationalization to distract people from the uncomfortable fact, that she acknowledged. From a “research point of view” means “I understand that the best quality scientific evidence is negative.” And “we..are in the healing business” means “but I want to believe in this anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double standard is also an incredible claim, because the opposite is true. SBM advocates want a single standard. What Dr. Lee is actually referring to is prior plausibility - scientific practitioners are more accepting of treatments that are biologically plausible, and are appropriately skeptical of treatments that are extremely implausible.  It is also a tu quoque fallacy - we advocate high standards of science for all treatments, even plausible ones. If some doctors uses drugs unscientifically, that does not justify chucking science whenever it conflicts with our beliefs and desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, in fact, the CAM proponents who want a double standard. Imagine if after hundreds of studies the best a drug could do for any indication is a weak effect that is likely just placebo - the signal cannot be separated from the noise. Imagine  a pharmaceutical company making the exact same rationalizations to put its failed drug on the market anyway that acupuncture proponents make for acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article concludes, as most do, with a positive anecdote from a believer - Elise Feingold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I decided to leave my science brain aside,” she said. “I felt it had helped other people, and it might help me. I don’t know how it works, but it’s got 4,000 years of Chinese medicine behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She begins with what amounts to saying that anecdotal evidence is more compelling that rigorous science. This, of course, makes no sense. The whole point of scientific rigor is for evidence to be more objective and reliable - to control for any many variables as possible. Anecdotes are unreliable because they do not control for any variables. Proponents of acupuncture are happy to cite scientific evidence when they think it supports their beliefs, but then will chuck science in favor of low quality anecdotes as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feingold finishes with the commonplace &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=15"&gt;appeal to antiquity&lt;/a&gt;.  The premise of this argument is that a treatment that has no real effect could not survive for thousands of years. History proves that this premise is false (see blood letting), and it also profoundly underestimates the human capacity for self-deception and therefore the need for scientific controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still no compelling evidence that there is any real effect to acupuncture.  It didn’t have to turn out that way, but that is the way the scientific chips fell. The treatment also lacks plausibility (although I usually point out that something is happening, unlike homeopathy, and so there is the physical possibility of an effect), and in medicine you only get two strikes. No evidence and no plausibility means that you’re out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the disconnect continues. Proponents keep pretending that there is compelling evidence, or it has not been properly studied yet, or it does not have to be studied because historical anecdotes are enough - whichever argument suits the moment. Meanwhile the media keep breathlessly telling us that acupuncture is gaining ground, while the evidence is standing still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of SBM is that support and resources should follow scientific support. In the world of CAM, however, support follows belief, and the science seems to be an afterthought or, worse, an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “(HIV/AIDS) is a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, and that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Catholic health minister warns that HIV can pass through condoms and therefore they basically don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not difficult to point out the obvious here. The evidence shows that, when used properly, condoms decrease the risk of HIV transmission by 90%. The Pope and the Catholic church has an obvious conflict here as they have had a longstanding policy against condom use on moral grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to point out that I have no problem with a religious organization preaching a moral code. I may have a problem with specific beliefs or tenets of certain religions, if I think they are malignant or immoral from a more objective basis, but I believe in freedom of religion and they certainly have the right to preach what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have a serious problem with anyone who makes specific scientific claims just to support a moral position.  Having a religious stance against condom use does not mean you get to make up your own scientific facts about them. Further, when dealing with a public health crisis, like HIV in Africa, spreading misinformation can be considered malfeasance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, the Pope and the church should just say what they believe - go ahead and promote abstinence and fidelity as one means of preventing the spread of HIV. But do not make up scientific facts to support a moral position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This behavior stems from the general human desire for clean simplicity combined with the tendency to defend held positions at all costs. Reality is often not accommodating - it’s ambiguous and involves trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twisting science to support a religious belief is also just a failed strategy. The false scientific arguments just end up diluting the moral argument and squandering the credibility of those who make them. It is better to admit that condoms may be effective, but abstinence is more moral. Or that embryonic stem cells may create effective cures, but the moral trade-offs are not worth it. Don’t pretend stem cells don’t hold promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By linking himself to a demonstrably false factual claim, the Pope has only succeeded in removing himself from any serious public discussion on the issue. And, to the extent that any of his followers actually believe his false statements, he has potentially contributed to the spread of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t fight the facts - it’s a losing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There was an unindicted co-conspirator in the case against Fumo. That would be the city that spawned him, took what he delivered and then pretended to be shocked, shocked at the unsavory details of how he manipulated the process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;That, of course, would be Philadelphia. That, of course, would be us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editorial's headline is "We've met the enemy, and he is us".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linguistically speaking, this all started in 1813,  when Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry famously wrote to General William Henry Harrison reporting a victory in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Erie"&gt;Battle of Lake Erie&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We have met the enemy and they are ours. Two ships, two brigs, one schooner and one sloop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quotation is often amended to &amp;quot;… and he is ours&amp;quot;, perhaps due to prescriptive nervousness about &amp;quot;singular they&amp;quot;.  In particular, when Walt Kelly invented his now-even-more-famous variant, it was in the form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;We have met the enemy and he is us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia entry for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Kelly"&gt;Walt Kelly&lt;/a&gt; similarly singularizes the original to fit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Perhaps the most famous quotation … is, &amp;quot;We have met the enemy and he is us&amp;quot; (a paraphrase of Commodore Perry&amp;#39;s famous &amp;quot;We have met the enemy and he is ours&amp;quot; from the War of 1812). The earliest form of this expression appeared in his introduction to &lt;em&gt;The Pogo Papers&lt;/em&gt; (1953); it was used much later in the comic strip and as the title of a collection of strips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure exactly what the context of the original use in 1953 was, though I think it had something to do with McCarthyism,  the message being roughly that some reactions to an external threat can become more dangerous than the threat itself. These days, the best-known cartoon versions of the Pogo catch-phrase are the ones from strips commemorating Earth Day 1970 and 1971 (click on the images for larger versions), where the threat is internal and the response is seen as entirely benign:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pogo1.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pogo1.gif" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pogo2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Pogo2.jpg" alt="" width="200"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of further adaptations of this phrase out there, as a quick web search will show. "We (or sometimes I or You) have met the enemy and he is Y" takes on values of  Y = &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;you, me, Republican, Democrats, each other, my stomach, Alabama, the Tax Collector, Crabgrass, gay, awesome, Force Structure, some fat guy in Florida, strange, Wall Street,&lt;/span&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plural version &amp;quot;… and they are Z&amp;quot; comes in flavors of Z =  &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Partly Right, Armed with Pennies, The Tombstone Militia, Earmarks, illiterate, GUI's, curs, weird, annoying,&lt;/span&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Inky's editorial makes a different sort of modification: from "he is us" to "that would be the city that spawned him", before working back to "that, of course, would be Philadelphia" and finally  "that, of course, would be us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic reason for this internal modification, I think, is stylistic. It would be confusing to follow &amp;quot;There was an unindicted co-conspirator&amp;quot; with  &amp;quot;He is the city that  spawned him&amp;quot;; and &amp;quot;They are the city that spawned him&amp;quot; is even worse. Choices like &amp;quot;It is …&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;That is …&amp;quot; are problematic, in part because they lead the reader down the garden path of common constructions with pleonastic &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=186"&gt;summative &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, like &amp;quot;It is obvious that …&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;That is why …&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the editorial writer chose the fashionable &amp;quot;that would be …&amp;quot; construction, which is often deployed these days as a way of answering a (real or rhetorical) question, just as in this passage. Adding &amp;quot;of course&amp;quot; to the second two repetitions  isolates the repetitions of &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; syntactically, conveying in writing an emphasis that might have been delivered prosodically in speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, in the universe of evoked associations, the &lt;a href="http://www.publicbookshelf.com/public_html/The_Great_Republic_By_the_Master_Historians_Vol_III/Commodore_c.html"&gt;naval hero&lt;/a&gt; and the comic-strip possum meet an urban legend that was discussed last year in a guest post by Larry Horn ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/005305.html"&gt;That would be in the modal auxiliary, Bob&lt;/a&gt;", 1/9/2008).&lt;/p&gt;

I translate:&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal of the course is to improve understanding of the vulnerability inherent in the central role information technology plays in society. The course offers seminars on the relationship between IT and society. Various implementations of IT are presented and discussed, as well as their influence on individuals, organisations and society. The course imparts knowledge about the role of information technology and issues of responsibility, determinism and free will.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are I'll be a guest speaker on the course, talking about archaeological information security in the past (cuneiform tablets, runestones) and today (digs that never get written up, digital excavation reports, the sack of the National Museum in Bagdad).

&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gc7ocmQkoAMELm5WQOQ9VrEf7GZQ"&gt;Mozart helps autistic children&lt;/a&gt; read a small &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gc7ocmQkoAMELm5WQOQ9VrEf7GZQ"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; of a few weeks ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lift music therapy programme, using the Austrian composer's symphonies, can accelerate development by up to three years in one month, according to speech and language therapist Karen O'Connor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms O'Connor has opened the first clinic in Dublin offering the Lift treatment, which is specifically designed to help children with autism, attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyspraxia. Brain scan tests have shown that the cortex area of the brain lights up when classical music such as Mozart is played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from noting that this press release says that the "Lift treatment" is designed for children with  various diagnoses---not only autism, as highlighted in the headline---the claim of development being "accelerated up to three years in one month" seems (with all due respects to Karen O'Connor) a little too......good to be true? grandiose? inflated? improbable?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the emphasis on music put to use in the name of therapy and "accelerating development" seems to be rushing to make music "useful" and a "treatment." In our household, music is just a constant presence, from Jim's whistling jazz to Charlie humming and singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie's been more into music than ever these past few weeks, since his teacher started teaching him to wear headphones----we had tried the little white earbuds for him previously, and he seems to much prefer the big, padded headphones. Indeed, with the iPod's volume turned up all the way, you can hear the music just fine from the headphones-acting-as-speakers and not on anyone's head. When he was very little, I played Bach (preludes and fugues) and sonatas and minuets and, yes, some Mozart amid the Chopin and Schumann. I'd place Charlie on my lap and play &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lullabies-Illustrated-Metropolitan-Museum-Art/dp/0152017283"&gt;lullabies from this songbook&lt;/a&gt;: Before he could talk, Charlie signaled which song he wanted to hear by finding the painting on the page. His favorite was, indeed, called "Mozart's Lullaby," a tinkling with more than a bit of the wind-up music box about it and---when he learned, over the years, to say "this one," it was that song Charlie often turned to, with its accompanying painting of a Chardin-esque father and mother hovering tenderly over a sleeping child on a couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music helped Charlie's language development and also our understanding of his communications, whether in words or without. Over the years, I learned to listen as much to the pitch and rhythm that Charlie used to figure out what words he might mean as he often emphasized the words of words, the consonants not as crisp. Without singing and music, I don't think we'd be able to communicate as much as we do with Charlie and certainly my appreciation for the other sounds the human voice can produce has grown exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mozart: Much as I like the "Rondo Alla Turca" and the famous sonata, Charlie's musical inclinations are elsewhere. He's been wanting to go to sleep listening to his iPod and, from the sounds of it, he continues to be more of a rock 'n' roller---clicking through the Beatles, U2, Jimi Hendrix, the Byrds, the Ramones, with some jazz violin intermixed. More and more I do think, the days of Barney are no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is all the therapy my tired ears need!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I can hardly wait to hear Charlie's (deepening---his voice is changing) voice, and Jim's. Just a few more days...........&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237360938528"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-19246161225222898">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ca11e04c466aacae</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">I Get These Kinds of Emails at Least Once a Week Now:</title><published>2009-03-18T03:46:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T03:47:43Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/YgoxnDttc1w/i-get-these-kinds-of-emails-at-least.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/19246161225222898/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=19246161225222898" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-get-these-kinds-of-emails-at-least.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Hi John, I wanted to thank you for your site.  I have been a Christian for several years now, and stumbled upon your site.  Quite honestly, it really rocked my world – I had thought the Christian apologetics that had been taught to me answered every question that non-believers could pose, and left no room for doubt.  However, after spending hours on your site and then reading your book, it is extremely obvious to me that the case against Christianity is far stronger than the one that supports it.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-19246161225222898?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

He just flat-out won't say. There's a suspicion that Mr. Goodyear is suspicious of this aspect of science, perhaps because he's a creationist. Asked about those rumours, Mr. Goodyear said that "such conversations are not worth having." I think we'd strongly disagree on that ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I must say that I&amp;#39;m happy to see that President Obama&amp;#39;s suggestion of making Sanjay Gupta the US Science &amp;amp; Technology boss, was not realized. The charismatic Gupta had the looks and smile for the job, and far better qualifications than Mr. Goodyear, but he withdrew his name after a heavy negative reaction resulted to his name being introduced.

&lt;p&gt;You should know that Mr. Goodyear, 51, is a chiropractor from Cambridge, Ontario, who studied chemistry and physics courses as an undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, welding and automotive mechanics, statistics and kinesiology. Those are his &lt;em&gt;total qualifications&lt;/em&gt; for the position which he now occupies.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237353033702"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2559">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c8a5e0e85b080a5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><category term="Sex"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Gay marriage"/><category term="homophobia"/><category term="lesbians"/><category term="Milton Bradley"/><category term="The Game of Life"/><title type="html">The Game of Life with same-sex couples angers mother</title><published>2009-03-18T05:08:50Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T05:08:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/the-game-of-life-with-same-sex-couples-angers-mother/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="lesbians-kissing2" src="http://skepacabra.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/lesbians-kissing2.jpg?w=198&amp;amp;h=171" alt="lesbians-kissing2" width="198" height="171"&gt;The onlone version of The Game of Life, first developed by Milton Bradley in 1860,&lt;a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=91291"&gt; allows players the option to choose homosexual marriage and child-rearing as a way of life&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know how kids are,” the mother told WND. “My daughter noticed right away (even before I did) and clicked on one of the girls instead of one of the men and then asked, ‘Mom, how come I can marry a woman?’ And then that led into a lot more questions that, quite frankly, I was not ready to talk to my 6-year-old about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She actually had to talk to her daughter?! Oh, the humanity! Don’t they know that nobody has the right to make other people’s children think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biochemicalsoul.com/2009/03/science-blogging-the-future-of-science-communication-why-you-should-be-a-part-of-it/" title=""&gt;Science Blogging: The Future of Science Communication &amp;amp; Why You Should be a Part of it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the past few years, a new development has arisen in the world of science amongst those who wish to purvey the wonders of reality to the general public.

&lt;p&gt;I'm speaking of course about the ascension of the Science Blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many articles have been written on the burgeoning importance of science blogs for the processing and dissemination of scientific knowledge (see references at the bottom of this post). Conferences have been held, letters in scientific journals have been published, and a myriad online conversations have occurred through social media outlets such as twitter and friendfeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all that, there still exists an incredibly large and significant portion of the science population that remains unaware of the existence of science blogs, of the vast amounts of knowledge to be gained from following them, and of the potential career advantages obtained from writing a science blog....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a nice one to bookmark and link to whenever the question gets posed in the future. But for now, Daniel is asking for feedback and who can give him better feedback than us - science bloggers and readers? So, go there, read it, and post constructive critiques in the comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/science_blogging_manifesto.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/TGQSirbys00" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237352108899"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_borg_is_taking_over_the_wo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e57c4e51c8a05f7a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">The Borg is taking over the World!!!</title><published>2009-03-18T03:57:33Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T03:57:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/4tDrpyJ-soc/the_borg_is_taking_over_the_wo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_borg_is_taking_over_the_wo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Those of you who were at ScienceOnline'09 already know this, because the news was first announced there, but now it is official - we have a new addition to ScienceBlogs.com: along with the English-language and German-language networks, we now also have the Portuguese-language network! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please welcome...drumroll.....&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com.br/" title=""&gt;Scienceblogs Brasil&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ScienceBlogs Brazil has 23 blogs (several of which were the part of the original Lablogatorios network that metamorphosed into Sb.br) covering a whole range of scientific topics. With more or less regularity, some of their best posts will be translated into English and you will be able to see them linked from our site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore the new network, you can start with these English-language posts:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com.br/brontossauros/2009/03/navigation_is_required_the_inc.php" title=""&gt;Navigation is required*: the incredible case of the desert ant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But how you participate is to change your Facebook profile picture to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/scarletletter_out.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/scarletletter_out.gif" alt="" width="300" height="336"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And change your status to something like “&lt;strong&gt;I am an atheist&lt;/strong&gt;”or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is an awesome campaign idea that will hopefully show some of the misinformed just how  ubiquitous atheists are.&lt;/p&gt;

He’ll be there for awhile. And it probably didn’t help that he was caught trying to get his own daughter to remove evidence in a criminal case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/the-cult-of-hovind-tries-to-take-his-case-to-supreme-court/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/HQTgn06WslE/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now his legion of followers who continue to believe his unbelievable story that he did no wrong are pushing to get his case to be heard by the Supreme Court.  So they’re sending out a letter to people promoting this cause. And for some odd reason, they stupidly sent the letter to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/kent_hovind_is_still_in_jail_a.php"&gt;PZ Myers, who has now reprinted it in all its glor–whatever&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Adrienne Gilbert in Kentucky…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An alarming situation with Dr. Kent Hovind of Creation Science Evangelism is putting every American’s first amendment rights in jeopardy.&lt;/strong&gt; I have been following this case since its beginning, so I wanted to share with you briefly what needs to be done and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of situation:&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Kent Hovind is in prison for practicing his first amendment right of free religion, and his case needs to go to the Supreme Court. We need everyone united together to overcome the oppression we’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of needs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
$25,000-$35,000 in the next 2-3 weeks&lt;br&gt;
specific prayer&lt;br&gt;
lots of publicity about the problems with this case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of action:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
listen to conference call&lt;br&gt;
send money&lt;br&gt;
pray&lt;br&gt;
spread the word&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First, visit Dr. Hovind’s website, drdino.com, for an explanation of the situation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://drdino.com/legalupdate.php"&gt;http://drdino.com/legalupdate.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This explains the ministry, what has happened, and what the plans are so far. It also gives the conference call schedule, which will give you the opportunity to really dig deep into the issue and understand why Dr. Hovind is innocent and his case is full of lies. The most shocking to me is at the end of the trial when the judge changed the law saying “more than $10,000″ to read “less than $10,000.” Multiple horrors like that stack up to a case that needs to be heard and overturned by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second, make the conference call.&lt;/strong&gt; (Next call is Monday, March 16, 7:00 p.m. CST, check http://drdino.com/legalupdate.php for updates.)&lt;br&gt;
Besides just learning this case and what we need to do, it will be an amazing time of digging into our government and our Constitution beyond anything you ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third, follow the Lord’s leading.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are up against spiritual oppression, so there is no textbook-format to follow to make this situation work out. God knows it and can tell each of us what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;contact me any time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I am a super-busy person already, but this project has to take priority because it is a 90-day window to save our freedom. So &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;please pass this along to anyone else who can help as well!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blessings, Peace, Freedom,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href="http://www.empoweredbytruth.org/Derek_page.html"&gt;Derek Dye, the Abstinence Clown&lt;/a&gt;. Derek is a holdover from the Bush Administration. So if you were wondering where all your money went:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derek Dye is supported by &lt;a href="http://www.elizabethnewlife.org/"&gt;Elizabeth’s New Life Center&lt;/a&gt;, a Christian-orientated organisation that received a federal grant of $800,000 in 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monster bless faith-based initiatives for taking our money and blowing it on shit that we knew already didn’t work in the first place. But maybe I’m being too hasty here. I’m sure Derek will at least be honest with the kids and not lie to them or resort to fear-based terrorism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know what? I can’t do it… …Because if I juggle these machetes over him, there’s risk. Something could happen. I could make a mistake… …I tried to reduce the risk a little bit, by practising. But it doesn’t matter how much I practice, an accident could happen. The only way I can completely eliminate risk of something happening to him, is if I put the machetes [away] and practice abstinence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SON OF A BITCH!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give me back my money, you fuckin’ ass clown!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a person whose success depends upon popularity, it was strange then that Dye ordered YouTube to remove a video of him in action, spreading the message of abstinence to a group of middle school children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, but don’t worry you can still see it and see how your money was wasted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their eternal credit, Amplify Your Voice have decided to &lt;a href="http://www.amplifyyourvoice.org/u/AFY_Joe/2009/1/15/Federal-tax-dollars-are-going-to-clowns-iliterallyi-CLOWNS"&gt;host the offending video in the face of repeated legal threats&lt;/a&gt; from Dye and the New Life Center. What are these people so ashamed of? Aren’t they proud of their covert religious piecemeal sexual education project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then agian, maybe this guy is walking proof of the negative consequences of not practicing abstinence. Though it all would have been fine if his parents had just worn a condom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/the-day-the-clown-made-the-children-cry/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/eixcsj7FI6I/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this was Bush’s last laugh:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/asteroid_incoming.jpg" alt="Artist drawing of an asteroid entering Earth’s atmosphere"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just saw &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/17/newly-discovered-asteroid-2009-fh-to-buzz-past-the-earth-tonight/"&gt;on Universe Today&lt;/a&gt; that asteroid 2009 FH — a tiny thing, maybe 20 meters across — will pass the Earth at a distance of about 80,000 km, about 1/5 the distance to the Moon and well above our geosynch satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&amp;amp;body_group=sb&amp;amp;sstr=2009%20FH"&gt;The most recent numbers I’ve seen&lt;/a&gt; show that closest approach will be on March 18 at noon UT, just a few hours from now as I write this. It won’t get terribly bright, since it’s really small. It’s only about the size of a house, which is dinky as these things go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People always ask what an asteroid like this would do if it hit us. Bear in mind this one won’t, but if something this size whacked us, it almost certainly wouldn’t reach the ground (unless it were an iron asteroid, which are less common than stony ones). Instead, it would burn up in our atmosphere, probably exploding several kilometers up. It might be big enough to generate a shock wave that could cause grief on the ground; &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/12/19/how-often-does-a-tunguska-event-happen/"&gt;recent work showed the Tunguska blast in 1908 was probably from a rock 30 - 60 meters across&lt;/a&gt;. So this one would do far less damage, because it would have had less than half the mass of that one at best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So another one slips past us. Let me say this again: while things like this make most people more nervous, it actually makes me happier. It’s not that more of them are passing, it’s that we’re getting better at spotting them! And that means when the day comes when one of these big enough to do serious damage has us set in its crosshairs, we may know about it far enough in advance to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237350824488"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0492657e73a36eff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Tear Drop Monument</title><published>2009-03-18T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/tributes/teardrop.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Photographs show a New Jersey monument to the victims of 9/11 which was donated by Russia.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237348720793"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3183">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/51a2dda22d53ddf9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Gardening"/><category term="frogs"/><category term="Hylidae"/><category term="nature"/><category term="Pseudacris"/><category term="spring"/><title type="html">FROGS!</title><published>2009-03-18T03:56:12Z</published><updated>2009-03-18T03:56:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/frogs/" type="text/html"/><link rel="enclosure" href="http://av.aqua.wisc.edu/jason/audio/chorus.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" length="331758"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Pseudacris_crucifer.html"&gt;Spring peepers&lt;/a&gt;!!   &lt;a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/resources/alan_wolf/pseudacris_crucifer.wav/view.html"&gt;[Listen]  &lt;img title="peeper" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/peeper.jpeg?w=130&amp;amp;h=102" alt="" width="130" height="102"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a rough draft of the introduction to a chapter on logic.  I would be extremely greatful for comments, critiques, and corrections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt; I'm a big science fiction fan. In fact, my whole family is pretty
much a gaggle of sci-fi geeks. When I was growing up, every
Saturday at 6pm was Star Trek time, when a local channel show
re-runs of the original series.  When Saturday came around, we
always made sure we were home by 6, and we'd all gather in front of
the TV to watch Trek. But there's one one thing about Star Trek for
which I'll never forgive Gene Roddenberry or Star Trek:
"Logic". As in, Mr. Spock saying "But that would
not be logical.".
&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt; The reason that this bugs me so much is because it's taught a
  huge number of people that "logical" means the same
  thing as "reasonable". Almost every time I hear anyone
  say that something is logical, they don't mean that it's logical -
  in fact, they mean something almost exactly opposite - that it
  seems correct based on intuition and common sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt; If you're being strict about the definition, then saying that
  something is logical by itself is an almost meaningless
  statement. Because what it means for some statement to be
  logical is really that that statement is inferable
  from a set of axioms in some formal reasoning system. If you don't
  know what formal system, and you don't know what axioms, then the
  statement that something is logical is absolutely meaningless. And
  even if you do know what system and what axioms you're talking
  about, the things that people often call "logical" are
  not things that are actually inferable from the axioms.
&lt;/p&gt;

And keep in mind that their last stunt involved dressing up like Klan members to protest dog breeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?blogid=7&amp;amp;entry_id=36968"&gt;they have asked for actor George Clooney’s sweat so that they may make Clooney-scented tofu called CloFu&lt;/a&gt;. (Clever. Don’t worry, PETA. I’m laughing on my delicious smelling inside) Now as an atheist, I’m all in favor of baby-eating but one of the best actors working in Hollywood today is crossing the line, PETA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is almost certainly just a lame attempt by PETA of drawing a &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/resources/logicalfallacies.aspx"&gt;False Continuum&lt;/a&gt; wherein they pretend that there’s no distinction between eating animals that lack sapience and eating incredibly sapient human beings. We get it, PETA. Real cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, liberal George Clooney might have been fairly receptive to animal rights causes, something I’m led to believe PETA once gave a shit about, but probably will be entirely turned off from involvement in any future animal rights causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement through his representative, the movie star says, “As a mammal, I’m offended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way to go, PETA. Nobody can turn off people to animal rights causes like you. You guys are aces in my book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now I’m off to grab a burger, which I’m personally dedicating to Ingrid Newkirk. In fact, I think I’ll name it after her and call it a Newkirk Burger. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;

No.  Will Goodyear have a job tomorrow?  Yeah.  Did it feel good to write the thing?  Hell yes.  You should write one too; send it to &lt;b&gt;pm@pm.gc.ca&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Mr.Prime Minister,                      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has come to my attention that your minister of state for science and technology, Mr. Gary Goodyear, seems unqualified for his position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, two news reports highlighted his unprofessional behavior and his questionable scientific credentials; the first link is to a Globe &amp;amp; Mail piece about Mr. Goodyear yelling and being abusive to members of the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) who were meeting with him regarding the federal budget (&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090302.wresearch02/BNStory/National/home"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  The second link is to another Globe &amp;amp; Mail article, this one about Mr. Goodyear’s treating of a question about evolution as “religious” (&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090317.wgoodyear16/BNStory/National/home"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, because he is your minister of science and technology, I would expect him to be at least minimally versed in the basic ideas of modern biology, coming as he does from an ostensibly health-related profession (although, arguably, not so much).  Saying, as he did today that the question about evolution was “irrelevant” is to dodge a basic fact about our world and put his understanding – and therefore, fitness for his job – in doubt.  The fact that your government has cut research funding by 147.9 million shows a tremendous lack of respect for the advances that university science programs give to Canadian citizens and perhaps shines a light on why you chose Goodyear in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a federal minister, it is also shameful to resort to yelling and bullying when confronted with a legitimate question of budget priorities as Goodyear did with the CAUT representatives.  If Mr. Goodyear is not able to do his job in a professional manner, then he should step aside or be removed from office to allow another, more competent person to fill the void.  I ask that you do this for the good of Canada and our reputation among first world nations as one that puts integrity and science in high regard, contrary to what your party is showing in your budget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yours,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael W.

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004888" title=""&gt;Adult-Young Ratio, a Major Factor Regulating Social Behaviour of Young: A Horse Study&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Adults play an important role in regulating the social behaviour of young individuals. However, a few pioneer studies suggest that, more than the mere presence of adults, their proportions in social groups affect the social development of young. Here, we hypothesized that aggression rates and social cohesion were correlated to adult-young ratios. Our biological model was naturally-formed groups of Przewalski horses, Equus f. przewalskii, varying in composition. We investigated the social interactions and spatial relationships of 12 one- and two-year-old Przewalski horses belonging to five families with adult-young ratios (AYR) ranging from 0.67 to 1.33. We found striking variations of aggression rates and spatial relationships related to the adult-young ratio: the lower this ratio, the more the young were aggressive, the more young and adults segregated and the tighter the young bonded to other young. This is the first study demonstrating a correlation between adult-young ratios and aggression rates and social cohesion of young individuals in a naturalistic setting. The increase of aggression and the emergence of social segregation in groups with lower proportions of adults could reflect a related decrease of the influence of adults as regulators of the behaviour of young. This social regulation has both theoretical and practical implications for understanding the modalities of the influence of adults during ontogeny and for recommending optimal settings, as for instance, for schooling or animal group management.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004930" title=""&gt;I Feel what You Feel if You Are Similar to Me&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Social interactions are influenced by the perception of others as similar or dissimilar to the self. Such judgements could depend on physical and semantic characteristics, such as membership in an ethnic or political group. In the present study we tested whether social representations of the self and of others could affect the perception of touch. To this aim, we assessed tactile perception on the face when subjects observed a face being touched by fingers. In different conditions we manipulated the identity of the shown face. In a first experiment, Caucasian and Maghrebian participants viewed a face belonging either to their own or to a different ethnic group; in a second experiment, Liberal and Conservative politically active participants viewed faces of politicians belonging to their own or to the opposite political party. The results showed that viewing a touched face most strongly enhanced the perception of touch on the observer's face when the observed face belonged to his/her own ethnic or political group.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004916" title=""&gt;Health and Human Rights Education in U.S. Schools of Medicine and Public Health: Current Status and Future Challenges&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite increasing recognition of the importance of human rights in the protection and promotion of health, formal human rights education has been lacking in schools of medicine and public health. Our objectives were: 1) to determine the nature and extent of health and human rights (HHR) education among schools of medicine (SOMs) and public health (SPHs); 2) to identify perceived barriers to implementing HHR curricula; 3) to learn about deans' interests and attitudes toward HHR education, and; 4) to identify factors associated with offering HHR education. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among deans of all accredited allopathic SOMs and SPHs in the United States and Puerto Rico. Seventy-one percent of U.S. SOMs and SPHs responded. Thirty-seven percent of respondents indicated that their schools offered some form of HHR education. Main barriers to offering HHR education included competition for time, lack of qualified instructors and lack of funding. Among schools not offering HHR education, 35% of deans were interested in offering HHR education. Seventy-six percent of all deans believed that it was very important or important to offer HHR education. Multiple regression analysis revealed that deans' attitudes were the most important factor associated with offering any HHR education. Findings indicate that though a majority of deans of SOMs and SPHs believe that knowledge about human rights is important in health practice and support the inclusion of HHR studies in their schools, HHR education is lacking at most of their institutions. These results and the growing recognition of the critical interdependence between health and human rights indicate a need for SOMs and SPHs to work towards formal inclusion of HHR studies in their curricula, and that HHR competency requirements be considered to overcome barriers to its inclusion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Studies have persistently shown deficiencies in medical reporting by the mainstream media. We have been monitoring the accuracy and comprehensiveness of medical news reporting in Australia since mid 2004. This analysis of more than 1200 stories in the Australian media compares different types of media outlets and examines reporting trends over time. Between March 2004 and June 2008 1230 news stories were rated on a national medical news monitoring web site, Media Doctor Australia. These covered a variety of health interventions ranging from drugs, diagnostic tests and surgery to dietary and complementary therapies. Each story was independently assessed by two reviewers using ten criteria. Scores were expressed as percentages of total assessable items deemed satisfactory according to a coding guide. Analysis of variance was used to compare mean scores and Fishers exact test to compare proportions. Trends over time were analysed using un-weighted linear regression analysis. Broadsheet newspapers had the highest average satisfactory scores: 58% (95% CI 56-60%), compared with tabloid newspapers and online news outlets, 48% (95% CI 44-52) and 48% (95% CI 46-50) respectively. The lowest scores were assigned to stories broadcast by human interest/current affairs television programmes (average score 33% (95% CI 28-38)). While there was a non- significant increase in average scores for all outlets, a significant improvement was seen in the online news media: a rise of 5.1% (95%CI 1.32, 8.97; P 0.009). Statistically significant improvements were seen in coverage of the potential harms of interventions, the availability of treatment or diagnostic options, and accurate quantification of benefits. Although the overall quality of medical reporting in the general media remains poor, this study showed modest improvements in some areas. However, the most striking finding was the continuing very poor coverage of health news by commercial current affairs television programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004910" title=""&gt;The Influence of Recovery and Training Phases on Body Composition, Peripheral Vascular Function and Immune System of Professional Soccer Players&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Professional soccer players have a lengthy playing season, throughout which high levels of physical stress are maintained. The following recuperation period, before starting the next pre-season training phase, is generally considered short but sufficient to allow a decrease in these stress levels and therefore a reduction in the propensity for injury or musculoskeletal tissue damage. We hypothesised that these physical extremes influence the body composition, blood flow, and endothelial/immune function, but that the recuperation may be insufficient to allow a reduction of tissue stress damage. Ten professional football players were examined at the end of the playing season, at the end of the season intermission, and after the next pre-season endurance training. Peripheral blood flow and body composition were assessed using venous occlusion plethysmography and DEXA scanning respectively. In addition, selected inflammatory and immune parameters were analysed from blood samples. Following the recuperation period a significant decrease of lean body mass from 74.4±4.2 kg to 72.2±3.9 kg was observed, but an increase of fat mass from 10.3±5.6 kg to 11.1±5.4 kg, almost completely reversed the changes seen in the pre-season training phase. Remarkably, both resting and post-ischemic blood flow (7.3±3.4 and 26.0±6.3 ml/100 ml/min) respectively, were strongly reduced during the playing and training stress phases, but both parameters increased to normal levels (9.0±2.7 and 33.9±7.6 ml/100 ml/min) during the season intermission. Recovery was also characterized by rising levels of serum creatinine, granulocytes count, total IL-8, serum nitrate, ferritin, and bilirubin. These data suggest a compensated hypo-perfusion of muscle during the playing season, followed by an intramuscular ischemia/reperfusion syndrome during the recovery phase that is associated with muscle protein turnover and inflammatory endothelial reaction, as demonstrated by iNOS and HO-1 activation, as well as IL-8 release. The data provided from this study suggest that the immune system is not able to function fully during periods of high physical stress. The implications of this study are that recuperation should be carefully monitored in athletes who undergo intensive training over extended periods, but that these parameters may also prove useful for determining an individual's risk of tissue stress and possibly their susceptibility to progressive tissue damage or injury.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ethical questions include whether alternative treatments expose human subjects to direct harm, or to indirect harm (by precluding a more effective treatment), not to mention whether the money spent to research alternative modalities would be better spent on other lines of research.  I think it's worthwhile to dip into the NCCAM website to look at some of the clinical trials this federal agency has supported.&lt;/p&gt;

We decided it was time to act and implemented a program called Circle of Friends (COF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying principle of COF is that knowledge is power. Our child’s different ability is as much a part of him as his blond hair, and the more other people know and understand about autism, the better they will understand our son. The kids learn more about the specific child and that child’s expression of a different ability, and then they can choose whether or not they’d like to become part of that child’s circle of friends. They’re not mentors, they’re not babysitters, they’re friends who do what friends do: support, advise, guide, interact, play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three basic parts to COF, adjustable to specific needs. First is the presentation to peers, preferably with you, the school counselor, and maybe a special ed teacher. Second is a letter that goes home to parents, explaining COF and asking for signed permission for their child to participate. And third is follow-up, varying from school-led activities with children who signed up to out-of-school activities organized by the child’s parent. Follow-up thank-you notes/updates are also part of this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part I &lt;br&gt;
First, we presented a slide show about TH to the children (TH had reviewed it all and given the OK). The counselor explained what autism is. I brought a PowerPoint slide set with pictures of TH doing the things he loves most: studying nature close up, collecting bugs, playing on the beach, doing art, playing chess. I also included pictures of his hugging his baby brother and helping his brothers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this approach, kids make a connection. They learn about commonalities in that part of the presentation, and they learn about differences. For example, TH’s special ed teacher talked with them about some of TH’s behaviors that they might find confusing and we talked through some of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part II&lt;br&gt;
The permission slip contained a carefully worded explanation of what we were doing and why. I included a clinical definition of Asperger’s and gave some examples of TH’s social behaviors that might come across the wrong way. We defined COF and its goals, and I think it also would be useful to include a longer outline of the program on the back of the letter. At the bottom was a simple permission slip for the parents to fill in and sign and our contact information if they had questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part III&lt;br&gt;
This is the implementation and “thank-you” phase. Depending on the involvement of your school, you may be able to arrange small-group activities at lunch or on the playground with kids who have signed up to be Friends. This part is, however, largely the parent’s responsibility to follow up on and arrange. There are any number of COF activities that you can arrange with parents and their children who have signed onto the program. Finally, we also had the COF plan read into the minutes of our ARD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did it turn out?&lt;br&gt;
Overall, the children were attentive, curious, and pretty thoughtful. About 40 permission slips came back, agreeably signed. The letter apparently sparked numerous dinner-table conversations about differences and understanding. One of the parents who had complained, belligerently, about our son told a neighbor that he now “felt small” knowing the reality of the situation. We heard feedback like, “This helps us understand so much better,” and “I’m hearing so many good things about the letter,” and “I’m so glad to know more about this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TH’s teacher reported that the entire tenor of the classroom changed since we presented, almost immediately. Children didn’t react strongly or negatively to some of the strange things TH does or says. They seemed to understand him better. TH himself seemed more at ease: less flapping, more focus, less humming and vocalizing. In her last report card summary, she described him as being “well liked” by his peers, saying that his “social issues” had “disappeared,” which she attributed to COF. [Is acceptance of differences classifiable as “cure”? ;-) ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like more information about COF or documents that explain the program and provide prototypes for the letter and other information, please get in touch with me or see my blog for more. This is a profound way to achieve important change at the individual and community level, and I’d like to see it spread faster than a rumor on a hot parental grapevine.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Emily Willingham</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237336325303"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4197">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/85088803d8929045</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="blindwatchmaker" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Blind Watchmaker"/><category term="dawkins" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Dawkins"/><category term="dembski" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Dembski"/><category term="weasel" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Weasel"/><category term="computer" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="computer"/><category term="evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="evolution"/><title type="html">Dembski Weasels Out</title><published>2009-03-18T00:30:55Z</published><updated>2009-03-19T10:52:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/dembski-weasels.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over at uncommon descent William Dembski is musing over Richard Dawkins Weasel program. Why you may ask? Way back in prehistory (the 1980’s) Dawkins wrote a little BASIC program (in Apple BASIC of all things) to demonstrate the difference between random mutation and random mutation with selection, which many people were having trouble grasping. Now, this wasn’t a simulation of &lt;em&gt;natural selection&lt;/em&gt;, and Dawkins was very careful to point this out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as a demonstration of selection versus simple random mutation, with the string “methinks it is a weasel” being selected in a matter of minutes, when simple random mutation would take longer than the age of the Universe, it was pretty stunning. As a result, creationists have been having conniption fits over this little program for decades. Such is its power, the Issac Newton of Information Theory, William Dembski, spent a not inconsiderable portion of his time attacking this toy program. In particular, he claimed that after every successful mutation, the successful mutation was locked into place, and couldn’t be reversed. But he was wrong, and it seems he just can’t admit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, by using the Courier font, one can read up from the target sequence METHINKS*IT*IS*LIKE*A*WEASEL, as it were column by column, over each letter of the target sequence. From this it’s clear that once the right letter in the target sequence is latched on to, it locks on and never changes. In other words, in these examples of Dawkins’ WEASEL program as given in his book THE BLIND WATCHMAKER, it never happens (as far as we can tell) that some intermediate sequences achieves the corresponding letter in the target sequence, then loses it, and in the end regains it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is very easy to understand from the description of the program in the Blind Watchmaker, that no locking is occurring. The list Dawkins presents is not all of the strings that are generated per “generation”, just the “fittest” strings (ie, just those closest to the target. Showing all 6,400 strings in a paperback book is just not feasible, nor useful[1]). And even then, Dawkins is only showing every &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; fittest string&lt;/strong&gt;! So even if the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; string was backing and forthing, you are very likely to miss it (and don’t forget the back mutations to less fit strings will be &lt;em&gt;selected against&lt;/em&gt;, and not show up when we are only displaying the best string). It doesn’t take a mathematical genius to work this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been telling Dembski this for years (&lt;a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2009/03/15/dembski-weasel-and-video-level-evidence/" rel="external "&gt;Wesley Elsberry&lt;/a&gt; for one, and &lt;a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2008/10/19/dembski-and-marks-are-still-mischaracterizing-dawkins-weasel/" rel="external "&gt;again recently&lt;/a&gt;), but he just hasn’t listened. Now there is documentary evidence that Dembski is wrong, from a documentary on Dawkins work. How does Dembski handle this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when Dawkins did his 1987 BBC Horizons takeoff on his book, he ran the program in front of the film camera:
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sUQIpFajsg" rel="external "&gt;www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sUQIpFajsg&lt;/a&gt; (go to 6:15)
There you see that his WEASEL program does a proximity search without locking (letters in the target sequence appear, disappear, and then reappear). 
That leads one to wonder whether the WEASEL program, as Dawkins had programmed and described it in his book, is the same as in the BBC Horizons documentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t admit you were wrong, claim a different program is used (ignoring for the fact that the weasel program in the documentary still converged on the correct solution in a matter of minutes). However, it is easy to see from the video that &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of the generated strings are being displayed, not just every 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;fittest&lt;/strong&gt; as was in the book. That’s the difference between printed media and things like TV, you can easily show the intermediate steps without causing confusion, again, imaging if Dawkins had shown all 6,400 intermediates, that would be roughly 160 pages of gibberish[1] to demonstrate something anyone with an IQ above room temperature could figure out from themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, our chief programmer at the Evolutionary Informatics Lab (www.evoinfo.org) is expanding our WEASEL WARE software to model both these possibilities. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Say what? How long does it take someone to write a program that basically takes a string, copies it with mutations, compares it to a target, chooses the best mutant, copies and mutates the new string, and compares again until the target is reached? When I first read Dawkins book I made my first weasel program in a couple of hours in GBASIC (as did almost every geek in the Universe), converting it to QBASIC and using arrays and stuff took an afternoon, because I was trying to be fancy with the arrays, and adding in a lot of comments so people could follow what I had done. So a real programmer should have been able to make a “non-locking” version in the time it took Dembski to write his blog post. Heck, Dembski could have done it himself. People have written versions of the weasel program in Matlab[3], and Dembski is supposed to be a mathematician, why didn’t he? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if he were lazy he could have just looked one up on the web and checked how it was programmed. For a time there was a cottage industry in making weasel programs, and there were lots of them. To demonstrate, I have resurrected &lt;a href="http://home.mira.net/~reynella1/weasle2a.bas" rel="external "&gt;a program&lt;/a&gt;  I made in QBASIC[4]. Now, the program I’ve written [4] is written to be as close as possible to Dawkins original as described in the book in terms of how it works (although I’ve added in the ability to change the string and the number of offspring). All offspring strings are mutated (one mutation per string, the mutation is a random letter placed in a random lcocation), and no mutation is “locked” into place. Any given “good” mutation can potentially be mutated out again (and is if you watch carefully). If you run the program with 100 offspring (as per Dawkins), unless you are preternaturally fast you won’t see any backing and froing. If you run the program with 50 or 30 offspring, it is easier to see backing up [2]. The screen shot below shows the current best string, which is worse than the previous best string (and I had to add wait loops so it was slow enough for me to catch with PrintScreen, see also the string capture listed at [2] at the bottom of the post). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/17/images/weasle_1.jpg" alt="weasle_1.jpg" width="596" height="76" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with the low offspring number the program converges on a solution (see second screen shot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/17/images/Weasle_2.jpg" alt="Weasle_2.jpg" width="631" height="92" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that Dawkins program works just fine without “locking”. With populations of 100 offspring, where it is hard to see back mutation, I got convergence in 65, 36 and 100 generations in 3 separate runs. Quite similar to the runs Dawkins reports in his book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, instead of constructing conspiracy theories about how Dawkins must have changed his program (rather than realising the difference between showing all of a screen dump on an interactive medium like TV, and showing the most fit strings from each generation in a printed book is one of presentation, not core programming), why didn’t Dembski write his own program (or get his minions to write one for him) to check for himself &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; spinning wild theories?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. I forgot. That’s the difference between Intelligent Design and real science; real science actually tests hypotheses with data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[1] If he has 100 offspring per generation, than a run of 64 generations will generate 6,400 individual strings. Typical books can have 40 lines to a page, hence 160 pages to show all offspring, as well as as the fittest of each generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2] Here are runs I did using my program, with the program dumping only the &lt;em&gt;fittest&lt;/em&gt; strings to file.&lt;br&gt;
Off spring size 100, showing 10 individual generations (convergence in 37 Generations)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best string                     ; Generation&lt;br&gt;
pewjhokr ju hs c wecule ; 20 &lt;br&gt;
pewjhokr ju hs c wecsle ; 21 &lt;br&gt;
pewjhokr ju hs a wecsle ; 22 &lt;br&gt;
petjhokr ju hs a wecsle ; 23 &lt;br&gt;
metjhokr ju hs a wecsle ; 24 &lt;br&gt;
metjhokr ju hs a weasle ; 25 &lt;br&gt;
metjhokr ju is a weasle ; 26 &lt;br&gt;
metihokr ju is a weasle ; 27 &lt;br&gt;
metihoks ju is a weasle ; 28 &lt;br&gt;
metihmks ju is a weasle ; 29 &lt;br&gt;
metihmks ju is a weasle ; 30&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hmm, that looks “locked in” doesn’t it BUUUT here’s what happens with a population size of 50. Remember, &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; else has been changed about the program except the population size. Convergence is in 187 generations, in previous runs I have had convergence in 73, 98 and 128 runs).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Best string                     ; Generation&lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weasle ; 135 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weaske ; 136 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weaske ; 137 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 138 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 139 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 140 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 141 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 142 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks ju is a weatke ; 143 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks ju is a weatke ; 144 &lt;br&gt;
lethinks gu is a weatke ; 145&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note we see reversion now, despite the program being unchanged. If we had just looked at generation 130 and 140 (every 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; generation, as Dawkins shows in order to conserve space in his book) we would have seen&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a xeasle ; 130&lt;br&gt;
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 140&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Which Dembski imagines is locking, but its not.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[3] Heck, you could even do this in Microsoft Excel (shudder)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4] My weasle program in QBASIC can be &lt;a href="http://home.mira.net/~reynella1/weasle2a.bas" rel="external "&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the relevant section of the code
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Start:&lt;br&gt;
CLS&lt;br&gt;
LOCATE 5, 2: PRINT “Target:”; TAB(12); Target$; “  Diff”; BestDiff; “    Generation: “; Gen&lt;br&gt;
LOCATE 7, 2: PRINT “Current Best String is   “; Test$(BestFit); “ with a difference of “; BestDiff&lt;br&gt;
LOCATE 8, 2: PRINT “Previous Best String was “; Parent$; “ with a difference of “; CurrBestDiff&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Wait10&lt;br&gt;
Gen = Gen + 1&lt;br&gt;
‘Find the closest (ie fittest) string&lt;br&gt;
‘Note, there is NO locking &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
                CurrBestDiff = BestDiff&lt;br&gt;
                Parent$ = Test$(BestFit)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
‘Create Offspring, all offspring are mutants&lt;br&gt;
‘no site is preserved, contrary to claims by Dembski &lt;br&gt;
FOR I = 1 TO OffSpring&lt;br&gt;
             Site = (RND * TargLen) + 1&lt;br&gt;
             IF Site &amp;gt; TargLen THEN Site = TargLen&lt;br&gt;
             Char$ = CHR$((INT(RND * 26) + 96))&lt;br&gt;
             IF Char$ = CHR$(96) THEN Char$ = CHR$(32)&lt;br&gt;
             Test$(I) = Parent$&lt;br&gt;
             MID$(Test$(I), Site) = Char$&lt;br&gt;
NEXT&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve run a freely mutating version of the weasel against a “locking version”, I report the &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/weasles-on-para.html" rel=""&gt;results here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a week, the Texas State Board of Education will vote on the final standards to be adopted for science education in their state. Remember, Texas is a huge state, and they drive the textbook publishers’ business. If Texas decides that evolution is wrong, or they push their phony &amp;quot;academic freedom&amp;quot; nonsense (as long as that freedom doesn’t extend to things they don’t like, such as science) , then textbook publishers will roll over and make their books to follow suit. Those books will then get sold all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is not a joke. This is serious.&lt;/p&gt;

The final top 10 ideas included some enormously important ones, but the idea that was of most direct impact to the autism community, Fully Fund Medicaid Waivers for the Developmentally Disabled, did not make it.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of these ideas have large bases of passionate supporters, and over the past two months thousands of voters have asked us to create a space for them to continue the conversation around each idea and collectively work to find concrete solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A scrunchy face misinterpreted as a scowl. The tongue—it always emerges under stress or confusion—lolling around, seen as a mean leer. The problems with body space, ending in ill-received bumps and unwelcome grabs. The inept efforts at forming friendships, efforts that included popping off with some bizarre, nonsensical utterance in an attempt to make a human connection, but leaving the recipient confused, bemused, offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t realize that children, his peers, saw our autistic son like this, as a mean, big bully intent in some undefined way on causing them harm. We, the parents, didn’t get it. It’s hard enough for us to figure out the other parents.&lt;/p&gt;
And so, on through kindergarten, through first grade, his reputation built, unbeknownst to us. Our dawning awareness came with after-school soccer in May of first grade. One child, much older and savvier, bullying our son in that elusive, socially aware way that an autistic child will never quite understand. Taunting him, mocking him. Yet, this child’s parents saw every encounter with me as a reason to complain about how our son’s behaviors frightened their son. I tried to talk to them, to explain what TH means when he says, “Quing! Quang! Squong!” to a mystified child. I’m always up front about TH’s different abilities, but they seemed to think I was trying to excuse his behavior. What I was really doing was not advocating strongly enough for my son by pointing out to them their own son’s behaviors. 	&lt;p&gt;Second grade, in the fall, we learned that the parental grapevine was afire with rumors about our son, the “mentally imbalanced bully,” demands for his removal from school, for a psychiatric evaluation (Hey! Guess what? He’s already had those. He’s autistic. If you ever bothered to talk to me about him, you’d know that). I figure that if TH were more “autistic” looking, some of this might have been avoided. But unless he’s in full flap or vocalizing mode, he’s just one of those awkward, odd kids who generally can “pass.” Maybe we should have made him an explanatory T-shirt to wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, all of his teachers agreed fervently that TH doesn’t have a mean bone in his body. They insisted on this even as Mom-of-Frightened-Son started raising hell if TH so much as walked past her child in the cafeteria. She spent one memorable day angrily accosting what appeared to be every adult at the school, essentially trying to get our son locked down in some way. Her son’s bullying tactics were far more subtle than her own, at any rate. But TH remained oblivious, which meant that we did, too. We’re not much better than he is at navigating the byways of the socially manipulative. I had no idea that thanks to those maternal efforts, the parental grapevine was a raging inferno of rumors about our child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TH blows off negative social interaction as negligible—it just doesn’t mean that much to him, and we have the same tendency. I think that’s one reason we didn’t step up and advocate for him earlier, one reason we let his reputation take a huge hit. It just seemed so irrational to worry about some of that stuff. And because TH didn’t think these things were important, he was experiencing ongoing bullying that we didn’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been clueless for too long. We didn’t know about the merciless bullying TH had been enduring on the bus and on the playground. We didn’t know that other kids mistook his overtures of social expression as intent to harm. Now that we did know, we knew that we had to step up, to advocate much better for our son. Our first move was to counter, officially and in writing, the calumnies that one particular mother was spreading about our boy. We needed to make that stop. We didn’t demand that the school so much keep her son away from TH as we did that the school keep her away from our son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second move was to go straight to the kids. We needed to make a big statement about our son that would change the way his peers across second grade viewed him, a perception that would trickle up to the parents. And we did, with tremendous success. In my next post, I’ll elaborate on the program we presented, called Circle of Friends. If you recognize yourself or your child’s experience in this post, it’s something you’ll want to consider doing. It’s a small change for your child, but it can mean a big societal change in the aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Emily Willingham</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237325934574"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6476">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e0293da88971ae97</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Current Events"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Texas Science Standards: Game On!</title><published>2009-03-17T21:00:52Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T21:00:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6476" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=3221da5ab8e24207312429cc1db6787a&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was updated at 11:15 hours EST on March 18 to add the information about registering to testify in front of the Texas Board of Education at the final TEKS hearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m starting to see a little light at the end of the dark, abysmal tunnel of extra work that was recently forced on me at my day job , and I hope to be back to Skepchicking full-time very soon. In the meantime, I wanted to be sure to remind you all of the culmination &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4408"&gt;of an&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4179"&gt;important item&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3765"&gt;we’ve been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5684"&gt;following here&lt;/a&gt; for some time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas State Board of Education (TSBE) will meet March 26-27, 2009, to hear public testimony and to take a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;final&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; vote on science education standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relevant back story and a boat load of other pertinent details are included after the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of preliminary hearings starting in 2008 and stretching into 2009, the TSBE began reviewing the curriculum standards that dictate what must be taught in all Texas public schools. These standards, known as the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) guidelines, include all subjects, but of particular note in this review cycle is the language that describes the science curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the better part of the last decade, the TEKS science guidelines have included sub-standard definitions of science, and language (the infamous “strengths and weaknesses” language) that undermines the mission for sound science education. This material was voted on and passed by a set of ultra-conservative Christian state board members, all of whom are still on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, teachers were under no obligation to implement any classroom activities that reflected the sketchy language, because quality science textbooks were already in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with this review cycle, not only is the language of the TEKS guidelines under review, but new textbooks will be selected based on the standards derived from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, because of publishing costs, the standards adopted by big states like Texas and California have a major impact on the textbooks used by students in other states in the U.S. Publishers tend to print as few versions of textbooks as possible, so if Texas adopts poor science standards, there’s a good chance textbooks circulating throughout the country could reflect those poor standards. Not only will Texas school children be cheated, but school children in other states could be hurt as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you consider that the seven creationist-leaning Texas State Board members, including the chairman, Don McLeroy, not only continue to push for the sub-standard definitions of science and the scientific method in the TEKS guidelines, but went further and recruited two men associated with the &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.org/"&gt;Discovery Institute&lt;/a&gt; to be part of the review committee that is usually made up of science teachers and education professionals from Texas, it seems clear that the TSBE is positioning itself to open the door for religious myths to be taught in science classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, at the preliminary review hearings, good science teachers, concerned parents, and rational citizens rallied in overwhelming support of sound science. They showed up en mass in Austin to be heard, and each subsequent draft of the TEKS guidelines for science was more and more solid. Unfortunately, supporters of sound science are not yet fully in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, during the January 2009 meeting, the board voted to adopt the TEKS guidelines developed by their science review panel and writing teams, and in a 7-7 vote, rejected attempts to reinsert the earlier standard that included the ”strengths and weaknesses” language. This is the language that had been used by creationists board members to require textbook publishers to insert creationist language into the textbooks. So removing it seemed a victory. However, the board also voted to include a number of problematic amendments to the TEKS guidelines that would compromise the teaching of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the amendments are not automatically adopted. They must survive the final vote, but it is still important to be vigilant in this matter, because the board is under no obligation to vote in accord with the sound edits already made to the guidelines either. And the standards adopted on March 26-27 will set the course for Texas science education for the next ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is critical that the TEKS guidelines reflect the best science available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of you Texas readers of &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; — if you are unable to attend the final hearing next week in Austin — can help by writing, telephoning, or emailing your school board member. If your representative voted for the TEKS and against these amendments in January, then thank your representative and encourage him or her to continue to support science at the final hearing. If he or she supported the anti-evolution changes in January, encourage him or her to promote the best science education for Texas school children by voting to remove these unfortunate amendments and support the TEKS guidelines as drafted by the review panel and writing committees. In either case, let your school board member know that the proposed amendments should not become part of the new TEKS. (&lt;em&gt;Information on the specifics of the amendments can be found below&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those of you outside of Texas, if you are concerned, contact your local media, blog about this issue, or contact the TSBE directly. Let’s make sure there are critical eyes from all over the country on the Texas State Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your voice counts in this process. During the January meeting, several board members cited the public response they had received as justification for their votes. Almost all the votes were decided by a one-vote margin. Write, phone, or email today, and ask your friends and neighbors to write as well. Numbers count, and every email, call, or letter makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Find Your School Board Member:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;1. Go to &lt;a href="http://www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us"&gt;http://www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;br&gt;
2. On the line “District Type” select “State Board of Education”&lt;br&gt;
3. Type in your address and this will identify which board member&lt;br&gt;
represents you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacting Your School Board Member:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. All board members use the same email (sboesupport@tea.state.tx.us),&lt;br&gt;
so make sure to put in the subject line which member you are trying to contact.&lt;br&gt;
2. Locate your board district on the map at &lt;a href="http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/sboe/districts.html"&gt;http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/sboe/districts.html&lt;/a&gt; or search by address at &lt;a href="http://www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us/"&gt;http://www.fyi.legis.state.tx.us/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3. Postal addresses and numbers for phone and fax are listed at&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/sboe/members.html"&gt;http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/sboe/members.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A description and analysis of the Proposed Amendments can be found here:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/analysis-proposed-texas-educational-knowledge-skills-teks-am"&gt;http://ncseweb.org/creationism/analysis/analysis-proposed-texas-educational-knowledge-skills-teks-am&lt;/a&gt;, and also appended at the bottom of this email. Your communication will have greatest impact if you phrase it in your words; emails containing cut-and-pasted language may be viewed as a “form letter” by the board members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you email your school board member, please blind-copy (BCC) NCSE so we have an indication of the pro-science support. Send your BCC to &lt;a href="mailto:newton@ncseweb.org"&gt;newton@ncseweb.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to forward this information to your friends, neighbors, and associates who might be willing to stand up for evolution education in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———————————————&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis of Proposed Texas Educational Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) Amendments for Texas Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of amendments to the science TEKS were passed at the January meeting. Here is a brief analysis of these amendments, and why they are problematic for science education in Texas. In general, the amendments single out topics touching on evolution (including the age and evolution of Earth and the universe as a whole) from other scientific topics included in the TEKS. They uniformly weaken the presentation of these subjects, incorrectly communicating to students that evolution and cosmology are more tentative than the scientific community considers them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the amendments would open the door to the inclusion of creationist ideas. The amendments should be rejected for reasons of scientific accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCLEROY’S AMENDMENT TO BIOLOGY SECTION 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the amendment does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Inserts the phrase “analyze and evaluate the sufficiency or insufficiency of common ancestry to explain the sudden appearance, stasis, and sequential nature of groups in the fossil record” between existing standards 7A and 7B, relabeling 7B-7E to 7C-7F.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this is scientifically/pedagogically wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contradicts 7A, which states that the fossil record provides “evidence of common ancestry,” while the new 7B states that students should “analyze and evaluate the sufficiency and insufficiency of common ancestry.” This will create confusion among teachers, students, textbook authors, and test authors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase “sufficiency or insufficiency” is similar to “strengths and&lt;br&gt;
weaknesses” and is objectionable for the same reasons: it provides an opening for creationist board members to pressure textbook publishers to include creationist-inspired “weaknesses” of evolution, as occurred in 2003.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires teachers to present the equivalent of a semester-long&lt;br&gt;
college course in paleontology to high school students. To teach this standard would require not only the basics of biology and basic concepts in evolutionary biology, but topics not covered until a capstone Earth and Space Sciences course. Without that background, students are likely to misinterpret discussion of “sudden appearance” as if it were a reference to special creation of living things in their current form, rather than as an evolutionary process which takes place in time-frames measured in the millions of years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unreasonable to ask high school students just beginning to&lt;br&gt;
learn about a topic to sit in judgment as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of scientific evidence they do not yet have the mathematical and chemical background to understand in depth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase”supporting documentation” offered by Dr. McLeroy for this amendment reveals that terms of art in evolutionary biology such as “stasis” and “sudden appearance” are interpreted as support for special creationism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clearly shows that the motivation behind these amendments is to promote an anti-evolution, pro-creationism view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARGILL’s EARTH SCIENCE AMENDMENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) Earth and Space Science&lt;br&gt;
What the amendment does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inserts the words “differing theories” into the sentence&lt;br&gt;
“Observations reveal differing theories about the structure, scale, composition, origin, and history of the universe.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this is scientifically/pedagogically wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Astrophysicists do not have “differing theories” other than the Big Bang model and its extensions; there is no other major theory for the evolution of the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase “differing theories” makes the language weaker and less&lt;br&gt;
certain; changes which do not reflect the amassed evidence in favor of the Big Bang model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens the door for the teaching of creationist “theories”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) Earth and Space Science&lt;br&gt;
What the amendment does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes the sentence “The student knows that Earth’s place in the solar system is explained by the solar nebular accretionary disk model” to “The student understands that Earth’s place in the solar system is explained by the solar nebular accretionary disk model.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this is scientifically/pedagogically wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The accretionary disk model is the appropriate explanation for a science class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens the door to the teaching of creationist views of Earth’s&lt;br&gt;
origin, rather than restricting the discussion of the solar system to natural explanations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5)(B) Earth and Space Science&lt;br&gt;
What the amendment does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inserts “are thought to allow” into the sentence “. . .kinetic heat of impact accretion, gravitational compression, and radioactive decay, which are thought to allow protoplanet differentiation.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this is scientifically/pedagogically wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no ambiguity or scientific question about the heat sources necessary for the Earth separating into different zones (mantle, outer score, inner core) during its formation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase “are thought to” implies incorrect and unnecessary doubt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(6)(D) Earth and Space Science&lt;br&gt;
What the amendment does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inserts “the evidence that the” into the phrase “evaluate the evidence that the Earth’s cooling led to tectonic activity.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this is scientifically/pedagogically wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The change is unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implies a doubt about these processes that earth scientists do not&lt;br&gt;
share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pervasive theme in Cargill’s amendments is casting doubt upon long-settled scientific issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Schafersman, a member of the Earth Science writing team, has prepared a detailed analysis of the Cargill amendments at &lt;a href="http://www.texscience.org/reports/ESS-Report-Final-2009Jan29.htm"&gt;http://www.texscience.org/reports/ESS-Report-Final-2009Jan29.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEO’s AMENDMENTS TO BIOLOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terri Leo offered several amendments to High School Biology TEKS in (7)(A), (7)(B), (7)(C), (7)(D), and (7)(E). These were proposed before McLeroy’s amendment above, and reflect earlier labeling of standards. 7B-7E here are 7C-7F in the TEKS under consideration now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the amendments do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of these amendments involved inserting the phrase “analyze and evaluate” in place of verbs such as “identify,” “recognize,” and “describe”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7) (A) identify how evidence of common ancestry among groups is provided by the fossil record, biogeography, and homologies including anatomical, molecular, and developmental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the amendment, the standard would read:&lt;br&gt;
(7)(A) analyze and evaluate how evidence of common ancestry among groups is provided by the fossil record, biogeography, and homologies including anatomical, molecular, and developmental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(7) (B) recognize that natural selection produces changes in populations, not individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the amendment, the standard would read:&lt;br&gt;
(7)(B) analyze and evaluate how natural selection produces changes in populations, not individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this is scientifically/pedagogically wrong:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes specificity needed by teachers, replacing the different verbs with the same phrase. Teachers, textbook authors, and standardized test authors recognize that different degrees of understanding are implied by verbs such as “identify,” “recognize,” “describe,” “analyze” and “evaluate”. These are educational terms of art used to determine how to allocate time and effort; removing that information harms Texas education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase “analyze and evaluate” is not the appropriate level of detail to require of high school teachers or students with respect to the TEKS’s beginning-level presentation of evolution. High school biology students must know that evolution proceeds via mechanisms other than natural selection, but it is not necessary that students understand, for instance, an ongoing dispute among biologists about the relative importance of natural selection and other mechanisms. Because that is an unresolved question, there is no scientific consensus for teachers to use in planning lessons or in grading students. Specifying “recognize” allows teachers to go into that added detail if they want, but does not require teachers to take time away from other subjects to delve into arcana better suited for a college class. Similarly, it is an empirical fact that natural selection applies to populations, not individuals. There is nothing in that statement to “analyze and evaluate”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singles out evolution for special treatment, directly contravening&lt;br&gt;
an Attorney General’s opinion that the Board of Education “not single out . . . . a single theory of one scientific field.” There is no reason to apply the high-level skills “analyze and evaluate” to every item in the section on evolution and nowhere else in the biology TEKS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful Resources&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;______________________&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registering to Testify at the State Board of Education Meeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to testify in front of the TSBE and can make it to Austin, you should register early on Friday, 20 March 2009, or on Monday, 23 March, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. (Central Time). Speakers are selected in the order they registered, and the ~30 speaking slots are expected to fill up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can register in one of three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Calling 512-463-9007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Faxing the registration form to 512-936-4319 (&lt;a href="http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/sboe/forms/registration_form_public_testimony_012109.pdf"&gt;http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/sboe/forms/registration_form_public_testimony&lt;/a&gt; (choose “Committee of the Full Board”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. In person at William B. Travis (WBT) State Office Building, 1701 N. Congress, Austin, Texas 78701&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TEA’s official information on testifying can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=3958#Public%20Testimony"&gt;http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=3958#Public%20Testimony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the January meeting, priority was given to speakers who had not spoken at the previous meeting in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WE ASK SPEAKERS TO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Encourage the board to adopt the science TEKS as written by the expert writing teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Ask the board to reject the anti-evolution amendments passed during the January meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Support only amendments reviewed and agreed to by their expert writing committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIPS FOR TESTIFYING:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Testimony is scheduled for Wednesday 25 March, from noon to 6 pm, in the William Travis Bldg. The meeting room is on the first floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The day of the meeting there will be a printed list of the order of speakers on the table outside the meeting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Speakers should have 35 copies of their testimony to distribute to the board. This can include talking points or a written version of your testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Speakers are given 3 minutes for testimony, and will be told to finish their current sentence when the time elapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Board members may then question the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Be respectful and polite-as the old saying goes, honey works better to catch flies than vinegar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Three minutes goes by quicker than you think. Try to make one big point and reinforce it, rather than several smaller points. Many people will be testifying, so you don’t have to cover every topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237324443070"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/17/goce-on-orbit-shuttle-docking-with-iss/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0009a281d5ce4fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">GOCE on orbit, Shuttle docking with ISS</title><published>2009-03-17T21:01:26Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T21:01:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/17/goce-on-orbit-shuttle-docking-with-iss/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just heard that the Earth-observing satellite GOCE has finally been launched after a number of delays!

&lt;p&gt;Also, as I write this the Shuttle is a few hundred meters from the ISS, and has flipped over so that astronauts aboard the station can take high-resolution pictures of Discovery’s heat shield. They’re looking for damaged tiles. After that, the Shuttle will dock with the station at 17:12 Eastern time, and the fun begins: an exchange of astronauts, and the installation of the last solar panel needed to bring ISS to full power.&lt;/p&gt;

But that’s no star, that’s Venus. Right now Venus is incredibly bright, even brighter than it has been the past few weeks. That’s because it’s getting closer to the Earth as it rounds the Sun, about to pass us like one racecar whooshing past another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, Venus is almost directly between us and the Sun right now. That means we’re looking mostly at its unlit half; the lit half is facing the Sun, and we can’t see it. Or more accurately, we only see a little sliver of it, making Venus crescent-shaped. When Venus is on the other side of the Sun from us, we’re looking at the lit half, so it looks full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, even though it’s a thin crescent right now, it’s a lot closer to us so it looks bigger. That’s why it’s brighter now; &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/venus_phase.html"&gt;we’re actually seeing it occupy more real estate in the sky, so it’s really bright&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://somecanadianskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-pictures-and-venus.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/crescent-_venus.jpg" alt="Crescent Venus from Some Canadian Skeptic"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s so big that I just saw the crescent easily in my binoculars. And Steve, aka Some Canadian Skeptic, got a great shot of it &lt;a href="http://somecanadianskeptic.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-pictures-and-venus.html"&gt;using nothing more than a camera with a telephoto&lt;/a&gt;, as you can see in this picture here (click to embiggen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Venus is close to us right now (about 45 million km or 27 million miles) it appears to be moving rapidly across the sky; every day you’ll see it getting lower in the sky, and in a few days it’ll be so low after sunset it’ll be lost in the glare. So take the chance now! Go out and take a look, because it’ll be a couple of months before it’s visible again… as a morning star in the east. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237320230589"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/17/shuttle-diving/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d76d653c954aa0c9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">Shuttle diving</title><published>2009-03-17T19:20:03Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T19:20:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/17/shuttle-diving/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is very cool: &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/3693962"&gt;skydivers who make a jump every time the Shuttle launches&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, certain antivaccine advocates seem to think that this parody has something to do with vaccines, which just goes to show how far down the rabbit hole they've gone when they think that a parody like this speaks to the truth of their cause.

Very few have tried; I'm afraid this is very much like Monty Python's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSqkdcT25ss"&gt;Upper Class Twit of the Year&lt;/a&gt; contest, in which the competitors are lucky to stumble onto the field at all. Here are all the attempts to answer this question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a comment that isn't longer than about 200 words, that is grammatically correct and logically coherent, and that does not cite the Bible or other religious authorities (and does not rely on tales about who you went to high school with, or tortured analogies involving necrophiliac pedophilic milkmen), explain how evolutionary biologists resolve the trivial conundrum represented by the common question, "If evolution is true, why are there still monkeys?" Remember, answer as a biologist or intelligent layman would, not like Pat Robertson or Ken Ham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is an entry from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_one.php#comment-1472769"&gt;Barb&lt;/a&gt;. However, even if we didn't see the sarcasm dripping from it, a check of the email address reveals that it actually isn't from Barb. Disqualified!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_one.php#comment-1474664"&gt;John Kwok&lt;/a&gt; takes a stab at it, and gives a somewhat pompous but correct answer. His reply is notable for two things, however. It is accompanied by possibly the most empty threat I have ever heard — &lt;span&gt;"PZ - If I am bounced off Pharyngula, then you may find yourself losing some friends over at Facebook."&lt;/span&gt; — which immediately prompted a surge of voting to throw Kwok out. Then there is the fact that I specifically said there should be no talk of high school acquaintances, yet Kwok managed to squeeze in mentions of Abbie Smith, Ken Miller, his high school creative writing teacher, and the &lt;i&gt;wife&lt;/i&gt; of his high school creative writing teacher. It is truly a marvel, and a beautiful example of exactly how he got on this list in the first place. The oblivious violation of the rules, however, means he must be disqualified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_one.php#comment-1472685"&gt;Facilis&lt;/a&gt;. In an utterly stunning upset, he actually managed to turn out a brief, accurate, two-sentence explanation. The audience was stunned. The judge was frantically checking IP addresses and the validity of the entry, so miraculous was this short, and probably very temporary, flare-up of cogency. It stands, however. This twit has actually managed to complete the first section of the course!&lt;/p&gt;

He also said DC's arguments are presented in such a way "so as to actually shake my faith." But he still believes anyway because he has a relationship with his triune God, something rational argumentation apparently cannot touch. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really? Come on now believers. Does this not remind you of a little girl who has an imaginary friend and believes her friend exists no matter what we say to her? It's like these Christian believers were raised in a cloistered monastery or something. Have they never ever met people who say the same things about &lt;em&gt;Allah &lt;/em&gt;or the Jewish &lt;em&gt;Yahweh&lt;/em&gt;, or the Mormon God, the Jehovah's Witnesses God, or Native American spiritual forces, or the Hindu God? Where do these Christian people live who reject arguments in favor of such a relationship? I'm serious. Do they actually have jobs where they must rub shoulders next to other people who say they have a relationship with a different god, one of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Gods-Over-Deities-World/dp/0816029091/ref=ed_oe_h"&gt;over 2,500 deities of the world&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Atheism Blog&lt;/em&gt; informs us that at least 500 of these deities &lt;a href="http://atheismblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/dead-gods.html"&gt;are dead&lt;/a&gt;, where we also read:&lt;blockquote&gt;J.L.

&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric professionals in France who according to the paper, view autism largely as a severe psychosis that can yield to psychoanalytic methods, are one perspective.  According to Chamak, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This [psychoanalytic] approach, which has long prevailed and remains predominant in France, led to conﬂicts between the parents' associations and professionals in the late 1980s, when changes occurred at the international level (classification, autism aetiology and interventions)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parents' associations (roughly analogous to parent-run advocacy organizations in the U.S.) revolted against being seen as the cause for their child's difficulties began to distance themselves from professionals and advocate for behavioral approaches to intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actions of the parents' associations involve the identification of a problem: the psychiatric monopoly of autism interventions. The associations blame psychiatrists for fuelling the parents' guilt feelings and refusing new modalities of intervention. They demand the transfer of autism interventions from hospital to school and the training of professionals to educational and behavioural methods. They elaborate their grievances in terms of a problem-solving schema and refer to the North American model of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrasting to both parents' organizations and psychiatric professionals, Chamak brings in the perspective of autistic self-advocates and the recent history of both the autistic self-advocacy movement and the larger disability rights movement of which it's a part,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autistic individuals who are able to express themselves, insist on the importance of their experience to understand their situation and solve the problems encountered. Some of them want to have the right to oversee research and the policies affecting them, but also the right to intervene in such activities. They want to be involved in the activities of specialists, thereby remodelling their own identity, and some of them become professionals of autism...  To the objectives of providing mutual assistance and support, they add the political objective of defending the rights of autistic persons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what of the role of the Internet in all this?  On the bright side, for parents' associations and autistic self-advocacy groups, the Internet provides access to medical and research materials, giving laypeople the ability to directly challenge professional opinions from an informed position as well as achieve independence from professionals.  For self-advocates, the Internet has provided a medium for creating community, culture, exchange of ideas, and organizing civil action.  On the darker side, the Internet also creates new confusions.  Chamak notes, "especially concerning the aetiologies and the therapies of autism. It has now become difficult to distinguish between actual information and advertising."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a study on the women's rights movement Chamak summarizes a three stage process in social movements "First, affiliation, through a process of group membership and sharing of interests; secondly, a rejection of traditional definitions for that group's status in society; finally, individual problems become political demands when the inability to attain a decent life is seen as a consequence of social institutions or social inequality rather than personal failure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process seems to apply to both parent and self-advocacy groups, but what is being rejected and what is identified the causes of social inequality are frequently very different for each group.  Are there any common foundations that can be shared in working toward a common goal, or will the professional vs. parent vs. self-advocate tug of war in society and policy (and blogosphere) go on?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237311249873"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1491837155762455323">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/03c09b7ffa95632e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">You Can Be Good Without God</title><published>2009-03-17T17:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T17:33:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/you-can-be-good-without-god.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1491837155762455323/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1491837155762455323" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> I spotted this ad at the Queen&amp;#39;s Park subway station in Toronto.

I&amp;#39;ve been sent a letter pleading for help in his case — they want to take it to the Supreme Court. I will be very surprised if this gets anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Adrienne Gilbert in Kentucky...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An alarming situation with Dr. Kent Hovind of Creation Science Evangelism is putting every American's first amendment rights in jeopardy.&lt;/b&gt; I have been following this case since its beginning, so I wanted to share with you briefly what needs to be done and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of situation:&lt;/b&gt; Dr. Kent Hovind is in prison for practicing his first amendment right of free religion, and his case needs to go to the Supreme Court. We need everyone united together to overcome the oppression we're facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of needs:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
$25,000-$35,000 in the next 2-3 weeks&lt;br&gt;
specific prayer&lt;br&gt;
lots of publicity about the problems with this case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summary of action:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
listen to conference call&lt;br&gt;
send money&lt;br&gt;
pray&lt;br&gt;
spread the word&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Details:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;First, visit Dr. Hovind's website, drdino.com, for an explanation of the situation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://drdino.com/legalupdate.php"&gt;http://drdino.com/legalupdate.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This explains the ministry, what has happened, and what the plans are so far. It also gives the conference call schedule, which will give you the opportunity to really dig deep into the issue and understand why Dr. Hovind is innocent and his case is full of lies. The most shocking to me is at the end of the trial when the judge changed the law saying "more than $10,000" to read "less than $10,000." Multiple horrors like that stack up to a case that needs to be heard and overturned by the Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Second, make the conference call.&lt;/b&gt; (Next call is Monday, March 16, 7:00 p.m. CST, check http://drdino.com/legalupdate.php for updates.)&lt;br&gt;
Besides just learning this case and what we need to do, it will be an amazing time of digging into our government and our Constitution beyond anything you ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Third, follow the Lord's leading.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are up against spiritual oppression, so there is no textbook-format to follow to make this situation work out. God knows it and can tell each of us what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;contact me any time&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. I am a super-busy person already, but this project has to take priority because it is a 90-day window to save our freedom. So &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;please pass this along to anyone else who can help as well!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blessings, Peace, Freedom,&lt;br&gt;
Adrienne Gilbert&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire sad defense story is built on lies. Hovind is not in jail for practicing his religion — he&amp;#39;s in jail for &lt;i&gt;tax evasion&lt;/i&gt;. If you read his &lt;a href="http://drdino.com/legalupdate.php"&gt;legal update&lt;/a&gt;, you will discover that he has several feeble arguments that will not hold up. He claims that he was advised by legitimate lawyers that he did not have to pay taxes, and that he did not knowingly structure cash transactions to avoid reporting requirements. Unfortunately, he lives in a country where &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; knows of the 15 April deadline for filing their taxes, where tax cheats are publicly excoriated (especially by the right wing, of which he is a member), where it is well known that tax fraud is an avenue for arresting criminals — Al Capone, for instance — and where we have a prominent public institution, the IRS, which is inescapably well known, again especially among right-wingers, who love to shake their fists at it. When you get a lawyer who throws around terms like &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/07/suborned_of_false_muster.php"&gt;subornation of false muster&lt;/a&gt;" and claims that taxation of any kind is unconstitutional, in complete defiance of the obvious operational reality surrounding him, you should know that you're not working rationally (although, of course, Hovind's entire professional life is wrapped up in denying reality, so perhaps this is no surprise.) And finally, Hovind and his wife made a whole series of bank withdrawals that were just slightly under the $10,000 limit that would trigger reporting of the activity. They knew. They knew very well what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So sure, pray, pray, pray. It&amp;#39;s a complete waste of time, and I encourage the Hovinds to engage in that activity all they want. That con artist has received the punishment he deserves; sadly, it looks like his son, Eric Hovind, is planning to follow in his footsteps — I suspect because he isn&amp;#39;t smart enough to do anything productive with his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/12/image/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/hst_saturn_4transit.jpg" alt="Hubble sees a quadruple transit of moons across Saturn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, duh, that’s Saturn. But you can see four moons crossing its face at the same time! Such an event is pretty rare, and very cool. The moons are (from left to right) Enceladus, Dione, Titan, and Mimas. You can also see the shadows of Enceladus and Dione on the planet’s cloudtops, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/12/image/j/format/xlarge_web/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/saturn_equinox.jpg" alt="Saturn orbit diagram showing how rings appear"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturn, like the Earth, is tilted with respect to its orbit around the Sun. Our tilt is about 24 degrees, and Saturn’s is about 27. This means that twice every Saturn year (which are roughly 30 Earth years in length) we see Saturn’s rings edge-on. They can get so thin they practically disappear! &lt;a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/Education/saturnobservation/viewing2009/"&gt;That happens in September of this year&lt;/a&gt;, and as you can see from the image above image, our viewing angle of the rings is currently very shallow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The icy particles in the rings orbits over Saturn’s equator, just as the moons do. That means that if we’re seeing the rings nearly edge-on, the orbits of the moons are that way as well. This makes transits — moons moving across the face of the planet — more common. So on February 24 of this year, Hubble was able to snap a spectacular series of images of four of Saturn’s moons projected on Saturn’s visage. You can see how the moons moved in the image below, showing the time-sequence Hubble took of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/12/image/i/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/hst_transit_sequence.jpg" alt="Sequence of Saturn transit images"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the relative rarity of this event, what strikes me the most is how seriously frakkin’ big Titan is: if Titan were orbiting the Sun, there’s be no question is would be a planet; it’s easily bigger than Mercury! This also shows just how monstrous Saturn is; over 800 Earths could fit inside it. Saturn’s gravity is so powerful in can hold all those moons in sway, keeping them in their clockwork orbits for billions of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll add that I went out to look at Saturn a few days ago; it’s up when the Sun sets, easily visible in the constellation of Leo. I couldn’t help but notice how faint it looked compared to last year, and I realized with a start that this was because the rings appear so thin right now. They reflect so much light from the Sun that when we see them edge-on, Saturn is visibly dimmer! It really brought home to me that Saturn is not just a wandering point of light in the sky, but a &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt; in and of itself, and in fact a system of worlds which interact with each other. And they dance around each other, as they have danced for eons, and will for eons to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation is somewhat confusing. The article starts off with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada’s science minister, the man at the centre of the controversy over federal funding cuts to researchers, won’t say if he believes in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not going to answer that question. I am a Christian, and I don’t think anybody asking a question about my religion is appropriate,” Gary Goodyear, the federal Minister of State for Science and Technology, said in an interview with The Globe and Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what? &lt;em&gt;Religion?&lt;/em&gt; The reporter says he was asked about evolution! This makes the issue a little muddy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Goodyear was asked specifically about evolution, then it’s not directly a question about religion, and the quotation doesn’t make sense. Either the reporter got it wrong, or the Canadian Minister of Science thinks evolution is religion. Or that being asked about evolution is akin to being asked about religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me get this clear: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/02/18/is-science-faith-based/"&gt;science is not faith-based&lt;/a&gt;. Evolution is science, and science is not religion. Therefore, being asked about evolution is not the same as being asked about religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if he was asked about his religion, and the context was whether his religious beliefs are in conflict with evolution, then the question is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; appropriate. In fact, the situation would &lt;strong&gt;demand&lt;/strong&gt; it. He’s the Minister of Science! If he thinks evolution is not true because he’s a creationist, then every scientist in Canada should be demanding Goodyear be fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodyear, apparently, disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about those rumours [about him being a creationist], Mr. Goodyear said such conversations are not worth having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, I have a background that supports the fact I have read the science on muscle physiology and neural chemistry,” said the minister, who took chemistry and physics courses as an undergraduate at the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do believe that just because you can’t see it under a microscope doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. It could mean we don’t have a powerful enough microscope yet. So I’m not fussy on this business that we already know everything. … I think we need to recognize that we don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked to clarify if he was talking about the role of a creator, Mr. Goodyear said that the interview was getting off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-topic? I don’t think so. And in fact that followup question is exactly the right one to ask. Given the context, it certainly sounds like Goodyear was invoking religion in his answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, I thought that asking a politician about religion was not appropriate, unless that religion had a significant chance of interfering with that person’s ability to execute the nature of their position — for example, if a creationist is your nation’s highest science official. In America, sadly, religion has become a political substitute for &amp;quot;trustworthy&amp;quot;; politicians wear their religion on their sleeves, and it’s a standard topic for either defense or attack by the media or other politicians (how many people still think Obama is a Muslim due to the ridiculous attacks on him during the campaign, despite the Reverend Wright controversy?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, knowing a politician’s religion may actually be a very strong clue on how they will react when science-based legislation comes up for a vote. I’m not saying a politician’s religion will definitely affect them, but I absolutely want to know if my governor or senator or school board member is a creationist, just as surely as I would want to know if they were a flat-Earther, a Holocaust denier, or 9/11 conspiracy theorist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, this situation is exacerbated &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5ix2n89uPSDVn3fFzF3SIZ5ods-TQ"&gt;due to recent deep cuts in the science research budget by the Canadian government&lt;/a&gt;. That, coupled with doubts over Goodyear’s science credentials, is sparking what might be called a crisis of faith in the government among scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t blame them. After seeing what happened here in the U.S. when religious zealots made ideologically based decisions, I’m a tad sensitive to this myself. I certainly hope the folks up north get this straightened out as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237305708097"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/?p=1045">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a43d774dea87aa02</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bad science"/><category term="cash-for-&quot;stories&quot;"/><category term="statistics"/><title type="html">Lloyds and Carbon Monoxide</title><published>2009-03-17T16:01:25Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T16:01:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/03/lloyds-and-carbon-monoxide/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscience.net/" type="html">Just looked this up myself and saw that for some reason it never got posted on the blog, so here it is.

The name Quiverfull comes from Psalm 127: “Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one’s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They shall not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no accident that the passage refers only to sons and men, since they’re the only people who benefit from this movement. The crux of it is that women are to submit completely to their husbands, becoming nonstop baby factories who are expected to continue producing and raising spawn until they die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2009/03/14/joyce_quiverfull/index.html"&gt;an article at Salon&lt;/a&gt;, Joyce describes one of the stories she researched while writing the book. Vyckie Garrison was at the end of her rope when she met the man who would marry her and steer her into the Quiverfull movement. From the article: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’d had her first three children by cesarean section, but after coming to the Quiverfull conviction, she was swayed by the movement’s emphasis on natural (even unassisted home) birth. During one delivery, she suffered a partial uterine rupture and “felt like I’d been in a major battle with Satan, and he’d just about left me dead.” The doctor who treated Garrison lectured her for an hour not to conceive again, but she felt that stopping on her own would be rebellion. When she turned to her leaders for inspiration, she received a bleak message: that if she died doing her maternal duty, God would care for her family. For six months, she couldn’t look at the baby without crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s obvious that this movement is dangerous to women and to the children they’re raising. Each woman is expected to have around a dozen kids, and the oldest daughters are expected to help care for the others. Raising a child to believe something makes the brainwashing that much easier, which I guess is why so many cults build into their philosophy the idea that a ridiculously high level of reproduction is of the utmost importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce’s article goes on to show that leaving the Quiverfull movement is nearly impossible for women who grow to be so utterly dependent upon their husbands, and who worry about losing their children and becoming outcasts from the community. It’s very reminiscent of the FLDS, the crazed hardcore sect of Mormons – there seem to be many parallels between the stories from the women who escaped both cults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In slightly optimistic news, those women who escaped the Quiverfull movement are establishing a presence online and finding one another, offering support and encouragement. Check out the blog &lt;a href="http://2spb.blogspot.com/"&gt;No Longer Quivering&lt;/a&gt;, run by Vyckie and another survivor, Laura. I’ll definitely be picking up Joyce’s book to learn more about this growing, disturbing movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237301584462"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/oh_canada_canadawhen_will_you.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/58d292192f9c11bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Oh, Canada, Canada…when will you learn?</title><published>2009-03-17T15:31:12Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T15:31:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/8n-woNHk3ZM/oh_canada_canadawhen_will_you.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/oh_canada_canadawhen_will_you.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/"&gt;Globe and Mail has a pointless poll&lt;/a&gt;, no doubt inspired by l'affaire Goodyear.&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes, you just get flaming idiots in charge of important bureaucracies. Sometimes they even get handed the keys to the administration of important scientific institutions. And then they open their mouths and show off how stupid they are, and we poor peons get to sit back and watch the spectacle of money being shoveled into the hands of the incompetent for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090317.wgoodyear16/BNStory/National/home"&gt;Canada has Gary Goodyear&lt;/a&gt;, the chiropractor who has been vaulted into the position of minister in charge of science and technology. He does not have a good reputation — his &lt;a href="http://warrenkinsella.com/index.php?entry=entry090302-170342"&gt;management style leaves much to be desired&lt;/a&gt;, and likes to &lt;a href="http://challengingthecommonplace.blogspot.com/2009/03/cabinet-minister-blows-his-top.html"&gt;accuse scientists of conspiring to lie to the public&lt;/a&gt; — and there are suspicions that he is a closet creationist, so he was recently &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090317.wgoodyear16/BNStory/National/home"&gt;asked outright if he believed in evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I'm not going to answer that question. I am a Christian, and I don't think anybody asking a question about my religion is appropriate,"&lt;/span&gt; Gary Goodyear, the federal Minister of State for Science and Technology, said in an interview with The Globe and Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the answer to that one was, "No, no I don't, Bob." The giveaway? He wasn't asked if he was an atheist, he was asked if he accepted a basic scientific fact, and he immediately ran to hide behind the robes of whatever flavor of clueless cleric he favors. That's creationist behavior, alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Canada, how long until you give this sorry sad sack the boot?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/you_have_our_sympathies_canada.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Mxe5jBzsLSo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237300417145"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/but_its_a_tradition.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f988acb26765484a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">But it's a Tradition!</title><published>2009-03-17T14:00:06Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T14:00:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/2eVoPzfBvPU/but_its_a_tradition.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/but_its_a_tradition.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have been reading my blog for years, you may &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/10/fizzler_on_the_roof.php" title=""&gt;remember this passage&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="FOTR with Topol.JPG" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/FOTR%20with%20Topol.JPG" width="200" height="314" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen "Fiddler on the Roof" on stage more than 20 times in my life, starting at about the age of seven. Since I was about 24, I saw the movie a few times. I have had, over the years, LPs, tapes and CDs of several different renditions. I can play a few of the tunes on the piano. I love it. That is my favourite show of all times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard the music so many times, my brain is so wired to it that I cannot stop myself from crying every time I hear it (that is why I don't listen to it in the car - it is a traffic hazard). And it is not just a little bit of a teary eye, but full-blown sobbing. Shows my sensitive side, I guess, not something I am afraid of displaying in public. In the theater, I start while the orchestra is tuning. Watching a movie at home, it takes me about 10 minutes into it to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never seen Topol as Tevye live. I just barely missed it one year, but I had to leave London and go home one day early as the ferries across the Channel were going on strike. Still, he is IMHO the best Tevye ever....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have still not seen Topol as Tevye live. And now he is retiring from the role and doing the last tour.

They made an assertion I've heard many times, and he asked me to counter it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there I was, walking along the University of Texas campus, enjoying an absolutely gorgeous day (it was 75 and sunny!) when all of a sudden I'm accosted by a huge structure covered with gigantic (10+ ft) pictures of 5-20 week old fetuses. Surprise! I'd forgotten all about our annual day of political theatre hosted by some pro-life group on campus. I started having a very cordial conversation with a couple of (very cute!) pro-lifers when one of them makes the astounding claim that "Every biologist would agree absolutely that life begins at conception". I let it pass and then I call her on it after she says it a couple more times. Eventually she explains that she's very confident in this statement because their 'executive director" always says it, and claims that if someone proves him wrong he'll eat the paper it's written on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy. I sent back a quick reply…I daresay that no competent biologist would take the position that these anti-choicers claim is universal among us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life does not begin at conception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's an utterly nonsensical position to take. There is never a "dead" phase -- life is continuous. Sperm are alive, eggs are alive; you could even make the argument that since two cells (gametes) enter, but only one cell (a zygote) leaves, fertilization ends a life. Not that I would make that particular claim myself, but it's definitely true that life is more complicated than the simplistic ideologues of the anti-choice movement would make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently received more email from &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; in this organization; the mail is from a David Lee, but is signed "R.", so I'm not sure who I'm talking to. Whoever it is, they don't quite get it, but are trying desperately to weasel out of the bargain now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Meyers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in possession of correspondence between yourself and a University of Texas at Austin student by the name of Mark.  Mark handed me a copy of his email addressed to you, and your email response addressed to him dated February 25, 2009, as citing evidence that would require me to eat the page upon which your response was printed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark presented me your remarks as said evidence to be eaten because during the Justice For ALL Exhibit (www.jfaweb.org) presentation at UT-Austin several weeks ago I was heard to offer to eat the page of the biology textbook in use on the UT-Austin campus that asserts that &lt;b&gt;"someone having human parents can be something other than biologically fully human, at any point in their existence."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I proffered my eating-the-page challenge that day in response to numerous students' claim that the offspring of two human parents was not biologically human until birth (in their defense most of them were not science majors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not eat the page that Mark handed me that day because it did not contain the evidence I requested.  Which is why I now write to you.  You claim to have knowledge of such documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact you make the bold assertion in your correspondence with Mark that "[Human] &lt;b&gt;life does not begin at conception&lt;/b&gt;" followed by "...&lt;i&gt;There is never a 'dead' phase -- life is continuous. Sperm are alive, eggs are alive; you could even make the argument that since two cells (gametes) enter, but only one cell (a zygote) leaves, fertilization ends a life.  Not that I would make that particular claim myself&lt;/i&gt;... ." (my bold and italics)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm encouraged that you don't make the claim that human fertilization ends a human life; however in postulating the argument you seem to grant nebulous scientific credibility to those who might make such a claim?  For what purpose?  Surely not to discredit my position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you believe in the possibility of an extra-physical or metaphysical existence, I seriously doubt that you believe your own assertion that "...There is never a 'dead' phase -- life is continuous."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On what evidence do you base your assertion that "life is continuous?"  Do you believe in life after death in some physical or metaphysical sense?  If you mean by your assertion that at least one human self-directing organism must contribute living genetic material in order for a new member of the human species to come into existence I quite agree.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you have labeled my assertion "simplistic" and "nonsensical" that sexually reproduced human life -- I'll go further than that -- &lt;b&gt;all new mammalian species members&lt;/b&gt;, have a beginning, and that that beginning is the conception of the species member. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So professor, you're on the record; from a biology or human embryology textbook in use on an accredited university campus (your own University of Minnesota-Morris campus would be fine), please cite chapter and page that unequivocally states that "human life does not begin at conception."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to your reply.  Respectfully,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about complete, blind incomprehension…no, I&amp;#39;m not talking about life after death, since I don&amp;#39;t believe in that, either. I&amp;#39;m saying that it is absurd to talk about a life beginning at conception because it didn&amp;#39;t begin then: the precursors to the zygote were also alive. The only &amp;quot;beginning&amp;quot; of life that we could talk about occurred a few billion years ago, and even that wasn&amp;#39;t discrete, but the product of a gradual progression from chemical replicator to functioning cell, a cline upon which there was no point where one could say that everything before was dead, and everything after was alive. Life is a very fuzzy concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you'll notice is the frantic attempt to qualify everything by inserting the qualifier "human" before every mention of the word "life", to the point where they are even adding it when quoting me! Alas, it doesn't help them at all. I'm also confident that the freshly fertilized zygote is not human, either. There's more to being human than bearing a cell with the right collection of genes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this person wants a specific quote from a biology text that has the words  &amp;quot;human life does not begin at conception&amp;quot; in it. That would be tough, because it&amp;#39;s a sentence that rather boggles the brain of any developmental biologist — we also tend not to write sentences like, &amp;quot;human beings are not flies&amp;quot;. We kind of expect that anyone intelligent enough to read the textbook doesn&amp;#39;t need their hand held in superfluous explications of the bleedin&amp;#39; obvious. But you will find us saying simple things like that in email and conversations and even popular lectures to lay people…such as this &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/serpentine-edge09/wolpert_vid.html"&gt;talk by Lewis Wolpert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolpert is, of course, one of the best known developmental biologists on the planet. He is also the author of a very good introductory text in developmental biology (&lt;i&gt;Principles of Development&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0199275378/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0199275378&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0199275378&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0199275378" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
), one that I use in my classes at UMM, and in this lecture (which you really should watch and listen to in its entirety, it's very good), he does come right out and say the bleedin' obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I'm concerned with is how you develop. I know that you all think about it perpetually that you come from one single cell of a fertilized egg. I don't want to get involved in religion but that is not a human being. I've spoken to these eggs many times and they make it quite clear ... they are not a human being.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, that should help. When you go reaching for an authority in development, a professor at a small liberal arts college isn&amp;#39;t the sine qua non of the field (well, unless maybe you&amp;#39;re talking about Scott Gilbert…), but you really can&amp;#39;t pull rank higher than Lewis Wolpert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_fertilized_egg_is_not_a_hu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/q5qBEuN3d8g" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237298580489"><id gr:original-id="http://membracid.wordpress.com/?p=3171">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ebab61ab1dbc789d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entomology"/><category term="Insects"/><category term="Malaria"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="mosquitoes"/><category term="hope"/><category term="hype"/><category term="laser"/><category term="media"/><title type="html">Laser Mosquito Zapper?</title><published>2009-03-17T12:32:08Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T12:32:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/03/17/laser-mosquito-zapper/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://membracid.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmm. I am extremely skeptical about the success of this project.  &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123680870885500701.html"&gt;From WSJ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quarter-century ago, American rocket scientists proposed the “Star Wars” defense system to knock Soviet missiles from the skies with laser beams. Some of the same scientists are now aiming their lasers at another airborne threat: the mosquito.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a lab in this Seattle suburb, researchers in long white coats recently stood watching a small glass box of bugs. Every few seconds, a contraption 100 feet away shot a beam that hit the buzzing mosquitoes, one by one, with a spot of red light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The insects survived this particular test, which used a non-lethal laser. But if these researchers have their way, the Cold War missile-defense strategy will be reborn as a WMD: Weapon of Mosquito Destruction…….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We like to think back then we made some contribution to the ending of the Cold War” with the Star Wars program, Dr. Kare says. “Now we’re just trying to make a dent in a war that’s actually gone on a lot longer and claimed a lot more lives.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The scientists envision their technology might one day be used to draw a laser barrier around a house or village that could kill or blind the bugs. Or, laser-equipped drone aircraft could track bugs by radar, sweeping the sky with death-dealing photons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has been picked up and run all over.  The scientists named in it do seem to be legit, and &lt;a href="http://www.intellectualventures.com/default.aspx"&gt;Intellectual Ventures, LLC&lt;/a&gt; is a real company.&lt;strong&gt; But…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really seems problematic. Especially since all that was shown was a &lt;strong&gt;video&lt;/strong&gt; of a mosquito bursting into flame.  Was it real? Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the scientists named in this story seem to be entomologists, although it does say &lt;em&gt;“Dr. Wood, Dr. Kare and another Star Wars scientist teamed with an entomologist with a Ph.D in mosquito behavior and other experts.”&lt;/em&gt; Anyone know who that ento is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists interviewed say they plan to put lasers in villages in Africa to protect them from malarial mosquitoes. (Presumably they will also invent a sustainable power supply to run it.)  Some stories also mention hand-held personal versions.  The current (non-killing) version in the demo requires a desktop computer to run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would this be completely freakin’ awesome if it’s real?&lt;br&gt;
Yes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Good luck to them, and I hope it works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think this will be about as successful as the first Star Wars system. And I think the primary purchase of this news story is to drum up capital for Intellectual Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;

It included cell culture, biochemical assays, molecular biology, and experiments using mouse tumor models. However, one of the reasons that I got both an MD and a PhD was so that I could ultimately test ideas for new treatments on patients and, if I'm good enough and lucky enough, ultimately improve the care for cancer patients. If there's one thing, though, that I've learned in my nearly nine years in academic surgery, it's that far fewer patients end up enrolled on clinical trials than are eligible to participate in them. Every meeting regarding clinical trial accrual I've ever attended, or so it seems, concentrates on how disappointing accrual has been or how accrual has been flat or even declining.  That was especially true at my first job post-training, although it is less true at my current job, mainly because the clinical trial office there is superior to that at my old job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was with great interest that I saw this article in the &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-clinical-trails14-2009mar14,0,5126834.story"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; that acknowledged a problem that those of us in academic medicine have known about for years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A year ago, U.S. researchers launched what they deemed a high-priority study to determine if women with an often-fatal type of breast cancer could live longer by taking a specific combination of drugs. If the study found that to be true, the average rate of survival -- four years -- could be significantly extended.

&lt;p&gt;A worthy question to address? It would seem so. But the answer may be a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. arm of the international trial got underway nine months behind those in other countries. And researchers now expect to enroll only 350 U.S. patients of the original 3,500 sought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before drugs and therapies to save lives or reduce suffering can reach the market, they must be tested to ensure they're safe and effective. But the reluctance of Americans to participate in clinical trials has been a serious drag on medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/clinical_trials_where_the_rubber_hits_th.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/clinical_trials_where_the_rubber_hits_th.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/QalFHSiItrk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237298414582"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-1149090635431308892">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2172ea27922723f5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Canada" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Science Policy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">NSERC President Praises Gary Goodyear</title><published>2009-03-17T13:36:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T13:59:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/nserc-president-praises-gary-goodyear.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/1149090635431308892/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=1149090635431308892" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Gary Goodyear is Canada&amp;#39;s Minister of State (Science and Technology).

&lt;p&gt;In case you missed the Slate article from March 10 entitled &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2213353/?GT1=38001"&gt;Elf Detection 101 - How to find the hidden folk of Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, I have done you the favor of hot-linking to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is not much more to be added to this piece, although reading the link to the original Vanity Fair article was rather sad and depressing, given the economic realities of 2009. In a strange way, I almost feel like giving the people of Iceland a pass on their cultural belief in elves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I think about how ghosts and UFO’s are engrained in US culture, how Chupicabre is at the fingertips of Mexican culture, how dowsing is prominent in Germany, and how astrological blood-typing is ensconced in Japanese culture. To all of the people of their respective countries, they take these matters to heart as much, if not more, that the Iclandic people embrace their beleif in their huldufolk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrational beliefs have infiltrated our people’s perceptions of reality since the first tribes of homosapiens gathered. It is long past time to break one of humanity’s oldest bad habits - belief in nonsense, no matter where it occurs and what magical form it might take.&lt;/p&gt;

Like most any topic we find in the Bible from abortion to war, there will be inconsistencies and contradictory emphases within its pages, since the books compiled into the Bible were written by different people at different periods in time, and even edited along the way with inserted comments by pseudonymous authors up until the canon for each testament was declared closed. So we can expect to find inconsistencies within the Bible when it comes to the proper treatment of animals as well. And this is what we find. Andrew Linzey and Tom Regan are probably today’s most important Christian voices in support of a new respectful animal theology, having written a number of books on the topic. They admit that “what is clear, and what can be asserted confidently…is that…there are alternative, initially plausible and yet mutually inconsistent ways of interpreting the holy scriptures, some of which supports humanistic interpretations of the values nature holds, others not.” [Animals and Christianity: A Book of Readings (New York: Crossroad Pub., Co., 1988), p. xii-xiii). Indeed, that is par for the course. &lt;span&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what follows I’ll admit there are passages that speak warmly of animals and of our human obligation to treat them well. These pericopes exist. There are not many of them. We do find a few of them in the pages of the so-called holy scriptures. But we need to keep them in perspective by placing them within the larger context of the whole of holy writ. We need to understand the over-all thrust of what the canonical writings say about human beings, their relationship to their God, and toward animals. We need to place those texts into that whole context. There are always minority voices in any political party or religious grouping. So we shouldn’t be surprised to find minority voices concerning the treatment of animals in the Biblical texts and in the church down through the centuries, and we do. But that’s what they are. Keep this in mind. They are minority voices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians today are resurrecting these minority voices by placing an emphasis on them as if they were “plain as day” to the people of old. They’re not. We need to ask ourselves what the people in the biblical era would have thought about the treatment of animals in their day, not ours. Given the new paradigm that Darwinian evolutionary biology provides us for thinking about this issue, Christians are reinterpreting the main thrust of the Biblical passages to fit this new paradigm in light of these minority voices. They are doing this because we now realize that all animals are considered interconnected with each other in an ecosystem favorable for the rise of human beings where we are all dependent on each other. Given Darwinian evolutionary biology we now see an obligation to keep species from becoming extinct, as far as is possible. We must now care about all animals on the planet to help maintain this favorable ecosystem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We must place this new Christian emphasis on the minority animal advocacy voices found in the Bible into this larger context. The same thing has happened with regard to anti-Semitism, feminism, slavery, war, capital punishment, homosexuality and the treatment of children. John Shelby Spong, an Episcopal Bishop no less, has documented some of these kinds of Biblical texts and how they were used by the Christian believers down through the centuries in his book, The Sins of Scripture: Exposing the Bible’s Texts of Hate to Reveal the God of Love (New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2005). As history has moved on so also has our sense of morality. With this newer heightened sense of morality, Christians have been forced time after time after time to look for these minority voices in the texts of the Bible and in the theologians of the past. But doing this won’t exonerate the Bible from the majority voices that are to be blamed for the horrendous treatment of animals down through the ages.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So my challenge as we look at these texts is twofold. My first challenge is to ask what best explains the fact that Christians must continually seek out these minority voices in the past to defend what they believe? On the one hand is my thesis that the Bible was predominately written and compiled by anthropocentric barbaric men of the past who saw their relationship to the universe and their world in a self-centered patriarchal manner. They saw themselves as patriarchs ruling over nature, over other nations, over their families, over their slaves and over their animals. Just as women and slaves and children were regarded pretty much as chattel (property), so also were their animals. They predominately had an instrumental regard (versus intrinsic regard) for their property. This so-called property, all of it, was to help these ancient men in a hostile world throughout their lives, and so the care of their property was indeed real, but for the most part they cared for it mainly because by caring for it they had a better life. Again, there were exceptions, minority voices. But this is what we find in the majority of the pages in the Bible itself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By contrast is the Christian thesis that God revealed the essential truth about himself, the world, how to regard other nations, their families, their slaves and their animals. This thesis will be tested in this present chapter. If God revealed the essential truth about everything then how can the Christian explain the passages in the Bible which clearly don’t support such a thesis? I will maintain they cannot satisfactorily do this, especially in light of the new paradigm of Darwinian biology and the new awareness of the need for the rights of animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I don’t think my first challenge can be adequately met, my second one follows on its heels. Why didn’t God reveal the truth about the intrinsic worth of everything from the environment, to other races of people, to women and to animals from the very start? With regard to the sufferings of animals, why didn’t God tell believers in his book that animals felt pain and that they deserve to be treated with respect with dignity? Why didn’t God dictate several laws to the Israelites against animal cruelty? If God exists and has any foresight at all, and if it’s true that God knows human beings are “wicked,” then why didn’t he do this? If he had done so there would be no biblical justification for any kind of animal cruelty. Lacking this justification his faithful followers wouldn’t do it, or at least, they wouldn’t openly do so with a clear conscience. And such practices wouldn’t have gained any official church blessing. My explanation for this lack of divine guidance is because there is no divine being to be found in the Judeo-Christian religion. It is a man made religion, period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So let’s look at the Biblical texts according to how they have been understood prior to the rise of Darwinian evolutionary biology, the rise of Biblical Criticism and our heightened sense of civilized morality found in democratic loving societies. The reason for doing this is because it would become uncharacteristic of a perfectly good God to wait until the 18th century for these texts to be understood properly. For he would’ve known believers could not understand what he really wanted them to think and to do. And he would be found misleading believers that is was okay to be cruel to animals up until such time that they understood the minority voices found in his so-called word. For Christians to object that it might have been necessary for God to reveal the truth in this manner will be the subject of a later chapter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation and the Dominion Mandate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Genesis chapter one there are six successive creative days represented. The first three days prepare the earth for the populations that will inhabit it in the last three days. Mankind is created last. After creating the world God declares it all “good.” Good for what purpose? Good for whom? Of humans alone is it said we are made in God’s “image” and to humans alone was given what has been called the “Dominion Mandate” over the earth to rule and subdue it. We are to multiply and fill the earth, like some of the other created things, but we are also told to “subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:28)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is quite clear from reading this text that mankind was the apex of creation, the crown jewel, or the pinnacle of creation. Evangelical Ronald B. Allen sums this up in these words: "The biblical view starts with the assertion that the eternal God has created man, the most significant of all his created works." “Man is not only God’s creation, but the pinnacle of his creative effort…man is distinct, the high point of God’s creative work, the apex of his handicraft. The progression of the created things in Genesis 1 is climatic; all of God’s created work culminated in his fashioning of man.” ["Man, Doctrine of" Baker Encyclopedia of the Bible. H. D. McDonald, another evangelical, concurs when he wrote:  “The impression that the Genesis account gives is that man was the special focus of God's creative purpose…All the previous acts of God are presented more in the nature of a continuous series…Then God said, ‘Let us make man.’ Then--when? When the cosmic order was finished, when the earth was ready to sustain man. Thus while man stands before God in a relationship of created dependence, he has also the status of a unique and special personhood in relation to God." ["Man, Doctrine of." Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]. Other scholars concur: "The Genesis account of creation accords to man a supreme place in the cosmos." ["Man," New Bible Dictionary]; "...the creation of humanity is surely accented as the climactic achievement of God’s creative activity." [The Anchor Bible Dictionary (1:1166)].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is argued that other passages say otherwise. Some have argued that along with Psalms 8; Psalms 144:3, and the ending of Job that man is insignificant. But insignificant compared to what? Human beings are insignificant compared to God alone, but this says nothing against the idea that human beings are the apex of his creation. It’s entirely consistent for man to be the reason for creation and at the same time for God to be so above mankind that the Psalmist can wonder why God even bothers with us at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world was created for human beings. It was a “good” world, for them. And then God tells them what they are to do with the rest of creation; they are to subdue it and have dominion over it, something reiterated in Genesis 9:1-3 and Psalm 8. When we look at the Hebrew words for “subdue” and “dominion” we see just what God wanted from us. The Hebrew word for subdue is כָּבַשׁ and it’s a very harsh word which literally means “to trample on.” According to an authoritative Lexicon it means to “tread down, beat or make a path, subdue; 1. bring into bondage, 2. (late) subdue, force. [Brown, F., Driver, S. R., &amp;amp; Briggs, C. A. (2000). Enhanced Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon].  We see this word used in Zechariah 9:15 of Israel trampling on the weapons of her enemies. In Jeremiah 34:11 it’s used of slave owners taking back released slaves and subduing them again. The word “subjugate” would be an appropriate word for what this word means, and ding this demanded force. The same word is used by a king Ahasuerus who was angered at what he considered Haman’s attempted sexual assault (”subduing”) of Queen Esther, in Esther 7:8. It’s also the derivative word for the word “footstool.” What God said was for mankind to make the rest of creation a footstool for his own purposes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word “dominion” doesn’t fare any better. It has as similar meaning to the word subdue except that it also includes the idea of chastisement. This is no benign way to rule over nature. It meant to “master” over someone, especially when he refused to be subdued, or after conquering him. It’s used of King Solomon’s overseers who forced his laborers to build the Temple in I Kings 9:23. It’s used in Isaiah 14:2 describing the time when the Israelites defeated her oppressors and subdued. According to Biblical Scholar John C. L. Gibson, to “dominate” or “lord it over” would be what is meant. These two words, according to him, were “autocratic, imperialist verbs.” [Genesis, (Philadelphia: Westminister Press, 1981), p. 80]. One of these words was enough to convey the harshness of this man-given lordship, but when both words were used together the impression is of a dictatorial and domineering rule over nature, subject only to God’s rule over man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roderick Nash, a history and environmental studies professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, sums it up in these words: “The image is that of a conqueror placing his foot on the neck of a defeated enemy, exerting absolute domination. Both Hebrew words are also used to identify the process of enslavement. It follows that the Christian tradition could understand Genesis 1:28 as a divine commandment to conquer every part of nature and make it humankind’s slave.” [The Rights of Nature: A History of Environmental Ethics (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), p. 90].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1967 professor Lynn White Jr. laid the blame for our present ecological crisis upon Christian understandings of the Biblical desacralization of nature in an essay titled “The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis.” [Science 155: 1203-1207]. Of the Genesis creation account White argued that Christians believe “God planned all of this explicitly for man's benefit and rule: no item in the physical creation had any purpose save to serve man's purposes.” And he charged that: “Especially in its Western form, Christianity is the most anthropocentric religion the world has seen.” He wrote: “Our science and technology have grown out of Christian attitudes toward man's relation to nature…Despite Copernicus, all the cosmos rotates around our little globe. Despite Darwin, we are not, in our hearts, part of the natural process. We are superior to nature, contemptuous of it, willing to use it for our slightest whim.” Peter Singer’s book Animal Liberation, viewed as the “Bible” of the animal liberation movement, soon followed on the heels of this essay which supported his claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Episcopalian Bishop John Shelby Spong agrees by claiming the Genesis 1:26-28 text “set the stage for seeing the earth as the enemy of human beings.” [Sins of the Scripture, p. 49]. As such the Christian attitude that was derived from it is “anti-earth.” [Ibid., p. 55]. Spong articulates the Darwinian problem of evil for us in these words: “Human beings were not created in the image of some external deity; we developed out of the evolutionary soup as part of the fabric of life itself. DNA evidence today demonstrates that we are kin not only to apes, but to cabbages. We are part of an emerging life force sharing a common environment with every other living thing. No creature can dominate the world, as those called Homo sapiens have sought to do, because all life is radically interdependent.” [Ibid, p. 65].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several Christian scholars have objected to this interpretation of the Genesis creation text. John C. L. Gibson argues that “what professor White is describing, though a very real Christianity, is a debased and adulterated Christianity.” Gibson claims that “these verses in Genesis could not possibly have been taken by their first hearers to suggest that ‘man’ could do what he liked with God’s creation.” Accordingly, “‘Man’ is God’s representative on earth, his ambassador, and possesses no intrinsic rights or privileges beyond those conferred on him by his divine master, to whom moreover he has to render account.” [Genesis, p. 79-81]. Gordon Wenham, the Senior Lecturer in Religious Studies at the College of St. Paul and St. Mary in Cheltenham, England, concurs. He claims that although man rules over the world, he “rules the world on God’s behalf,” and as such in this text “mankind is here commissioned to rule nature as a benevolent king, acting as God’s representative over them and therefore treating them in the same way as God who created them. This is of course no license for the unbridled exploitation of nature.” [Genesis 1-15, p. 33]. Richard Bauckmann, professor of New Testament Studies at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland, documented several responses to Lynn White’s thesis. His claim is that these responses “can fairly be said to have refuted it over and again.” He even wrote his own chapter length response to it. [God and the Crisis of Freedom: Biblical and Contemporary Perspectives (Philadelphia: Westminster John Knox Press, 2002), p. 131. See his chapter 7, “Human Authority in Creation.”].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find it puzzling that these Christian scholars dispute what seems quite evident from the text itself, even if it can reasonably be said other factors were involved. While we must grant that the dominion mandate cannot mean humans can do anything we want to nature, including animals, the words used are extremely harsh ones when compared to our sensibilities toward animals today. How can someone “trample upon” a slave or a sheep beneficently? What does that even mean? It’s an oxymoron. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These Christian scholars claim our God given dominion mandate over the world should be compared and contrasted with how God rules over the world. We are not God. Instead we are God’s viceroys. So we don’t have the same rights that God has to create “evil” or “calamity” (Isaiah 45:7), nor do we have the same rights to kill at will because we didn’t create life in the first place (Job 1:21). We are caretakers who have been given a stewardship, they claim. But even if our role is to be described as they argue, Marti Kheel, a visiting scholar at the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California, argues: “Whether as dominators or as caretakers, human still occupy the hierarchical position of managers of the rest of the natural world. I found the idea of a God who, through divine act of nepotism, selects a ‘chosen species’ to manage the rest of the natural world deeply disturbing, and at odds with my feelings of kinship with the rest of nature.” [Nature Ethics: An Ecofeminist Perspective (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield, 2007), p. 21]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from these kinds of things, it’s said our rule must be based upon a loving, kind God. Implicit for them is the benign, loving, beneficent God of Anselm’s 11th century perfect being theology after centuries of theological gerrymandering. Having come to believe that God is perfect in love these Christian scholars would want us to think of the biblical God’s lordship in the same manner, as characterized by a loving beneficent king. Hence, man’s rule must have the same moral care in his lordship over nature. But this is emphatically not what we find in the Bible of God’s rule. Yes, there are voices describing God as love and/or caring for his creatures. But there are also many voices showing that God’s rule over us is very harsh, which is reflective an ancient brutal world. It was a very difficult world the ancients lived in where they must struggle to survive against early death and painful diseases from which they had no cures. Starvation was sometimes a few weeks away if they failed to successfully kill their prey. Wars took place almost every year in the springtime (I Chronicles 20:1). Kings were often brutal. Famines and droughts could devastate them. It was a hostile world they lived in. They must subdue it and make it obey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people in Biblical times conceived of God based upon this brutal world and the brutal rulers they have known. This God can be cruel. He can be kind. He is cruel with those who do not submit to his rule and obey his every command. He can be kind with those who do. This God can slam the world with a flood for disobedience, require Abraham to sacrifice his only son, pulverize the Egyptian nation with devastating plagues, send snakes to kill 3000 people for their disobedience, and be pleased when babies are dashed against the rocks (Psalms 137:9). He can send a drought or famine or plague of locusts or even another nation to kill every man women, child and animal for being disobedient. This God also threatens us with eternal punishment if we don’t think the evidence to believe in him is convincing. This God is described as a God of War, a Jealous God, and an Avenging God. This would be the divine model we find as the model for man’s given lordship over the earth. Be kind to subjects who are in obedience. But be very harsh toward those subjects who are disobedient. Trample on them. Break them down. It was a patriarchal world. Man was to dominate over the world just as God ruled. And so it couldn’t have been pretty world to live in as women, slaves, children and animals in this world. If a fig tree produced fruit, for instance, bless it, but if it didn’t, then curse it as Jesus did (Matthew 21:18-19).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I’m wrong about this Genesis text and if Richard Bauckmann is correct to say that despite what seems evident in the Bible the responses to my position “can fairly be said to have refuted it over and again,” which I deny, then Christian scholars still have a major problem. For then the problem is no longer an exegetical one but a historical one. The problem becomes not what the Bible says as interpreted by these modern Christian scholars, who base their exegesis on Anselm’s view of God in light of the new Darwinian evolutionary paradigm, but why God allowed this biblical text to be used by Jews and Christians to abuse the environment and abuse animals. This relates to my second challenge mentioned earlier. Why didn’t God reveal the truth about the intrinsic worth of everything from the environment to other races of people, to women and to animals from the very start? It’s far from clear in this text that he did. He could’ve been much clearer, easily, even if these modern Christian scholars are correct in their exegesis based on hindsight. So the fact that God wasn’t clear is an indictment of a perfectly good God who should’ve known how human beings would interpret these verses. As the CEO of any company knows, if there is any miscommunication about the goals of that company, the fault is his or hers. If the company does wrong because it misunderstood the CEO’s directives, then it’s his or her fault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biblically speaking we do not clearly see God’s special providential care for animals in the Creation story with its dominion mandate, nor as we will see in a later chapter, do we see it based on God’s judgment upon the world because of the sin of man. It’s just not to be found in these early chapters in the Bible, the ones that speak of the beginnings of God’s creative work in the world, the ones that set the stage for interpreting the rest of the biblical texts regarding the treatment of animals and of nature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old Testament Passages Both Good and Bad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Old Testament there are good passages on behalf of animals as well as passages disrespectful and hurtful to animals. Believing that God is perfectly good means that believers must try to explain why he commanded the abuse of animals. We would expect that any society would produce something good to say on behalf of animals, especially one that collected her writings together into a canon for over a millennium. And so we have some minority voices can be found. After God destroyed all flesh in the Flood he then subsequently promised to all living creatures, man and beast, not to do this again (Genesis 9:8-17), providing the rainbow as a sign of this covenant (as if THAT was the first time a rainbow was ever seen before!). Some comfort that; given God’s post-flood mandate for humans to hunt animals down and kill them for food. The Sabbath day was a rest for both man and beast (Exodus 23:12; Deuteronomy 5:14). The Israelites were told that if they saw their “brother’s ass or his ox fallen down by the way,” they were not to withhold their help from them, but rather to “help him to lift them up again.” (Deuteronomy 22:4). We also read: “If you chance to come upon a bird’s nest, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs and the mother sitting upon the young or upon the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young; you shall let the mother go, but the young you may take to yourself; that it may go well with you, and that you may live long.”(Deuteronomy 22:6-7). The ox was not to plough with the ass (Deuteronomy 22:10), nor were the Israelites to muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain (Deuteronomy 25:4). In Psalm 36:6 we’re told God saves a beast as well as a man. In Psalm 147:9 we’re told that God gives the beasts their food, and in Psalm 148:7-10 they praise him. In Proverbs 12:10 we read: “A righteous man has regard for the life of his beast, but the mercy of the wicked is cruel.” (See note) And in Jonah 4:11 God is concerned for both the Ninevites and their beasts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE. If someone wants to hang the care for animals on this lone passage in the Bible from the book of Proverbs then we should be sure to understand something about the genre of that book and with it wisdom literature as a whole. According to Gordon D. Fee and Douglas Stuart, the book of Proverbs contains “prudential wisdom—that is, rules and regulations people can use to help themselves live responsible, successful lives.” If a person wants to be successful then he or she should follow its advice, they claim. [See their book, How to Read the Bible For All its Worth (Grand Rapids; Zondervan, 1982), pp. 195-203.] Read with this over-all context of the book in mind, Proverbs 12:10 may merely be saying that if a man wants to be successful he will have regard for the life of his beast, for a righteous man was a successful man and a successful man was a righteous man, usually. This is why we find in the story of Job, as another book in the wisdom literature, a man having great difficulty defending his righteousness before his critics even though disaster has struck him not just once but twice.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expressed in these verses is some minimal concern for animals. However, one can question the reason why Israelites cared for their animals, given the harshness we find in the dominion mandate and the earliest parts of Genesis. Surely it wasn’t just that they cared for the intrinsic worth and value of animals qua animals. It was because they needed them. Animals were part of their domain, their property, and if found in the wild they were hunted and eaten. Caring for them, just like caring for their wives and children and slaves, was important to Israelite men. For by doing so it was better off for them, their patriarchal headship, and their lordship over their households. Animals would have had merely instrumental value, not intrinsic value. If a man became emotionally attached to an animal to give it special care, which no doubt was done, that was well and good. But it would do little to stop him from butchering it for a future meal much like how farmers do today, or in sacrificing it to God. The Israelites were given permission to eat the ox, the sheep, the goat, the hart, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope, sheep, birds and fish, what are known as “clean” animals. (Deuteronomy 14:4-20).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of animal sacrifices, the Bible strongly suggests this was done quite a bit by everyone, especially at festivals and dedication ceremonies, all sanctioned and commanded by God. According to the Bible there were priests who came from the tribe of Levite who were to offer up sacrifices to God for everything from thanksgiving, to expiation for sins for the individual, to expiation for sins for the whole nation on the Day of Atonement. When Solomon’s slave laborers finished the Temple we read where “the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the Lord. King Solomon offered as a sacrifice twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep.” This was surely an exaggeration if it happened at all (see Jeremiah 7:22-23), but it’s stated nonetheless (II Chronicles 7:5).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, from our perspective this was a completely unnecessary waste of animal life, and a brutal way to kill them. Even if we admit that animal sacrifices were to prefigure the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross to atone for our sins, and even if we set aside the insurmountable intellectual problems in understanding how Jesus’ death does anything to atone for our sins, Old Testament sacrifices, according to Christian theology, did nothing to atone for anyone’s sins…nothing. In the canonical book of Hebrews we read that it was “impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins,” that all of these sacrifices could “never take away sins.” They couldn’t have, otherwise Jesus would never had to die on the cross as a sacrifice “for our sins” it’s argued (see Hebrews 10:1-18). These innumerable animals were brutally butchered for no reason at all…none. Their throats were slit and the blood was drained on the altar where they were subsequently skinned and quartered into pieces and then burnt with the smoke of their flesh rising up to God who was considered to reside up in the sky (i.e., “heaven”), as a sweet smelling aroma (Exodus 29:18, 25; Leviticus 3:16; 23:18, etc). Depending on the kind of sacrifice offered some of the meat went to the priests and/or the person making the sacrificial offering. [For more on the biblical depictions of this sacrificial system see Roland de Vaux’s classic work, Ancient Israel: Religious Institutions Vol 2 (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company1965), pp. 415-456]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Prophetic Tradition.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conspicuously lacking in the Old Testament are any prophetic denunciations of animal cruelty, since it’s regularly claimed that the biblical prophetic tradition expresses the moral core of Judaism and Christianity. [One can see this expressed in my former professor Daniel Maguire’s book, The Moral Core of Judaism and Christianity: Reclaiming the Revolution (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993]. When arguing against the so-called New Atheists like Richard Dawkins, John F. Haught, the former Chair and professor in the department of theology at Georgetown University, in Washington D.C., faulted them for not understanding this. Describing the moral core of the prophetic tradition with its emphasis on justice as “God’s preferential option for the poor and disadvantaged,” he wrote: “To maintain that we can understand modern and contemporary social justice, civil rights, and liberation movements without any reference to Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, Jesus, and other biblical prophets makes Dawkins’s treatment of morality and faith almost unworthy of comment.” [God and the New Atheists: A Critical Response to Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), p. 68]. But there is nothing in these Old Testament prophets decrying any injustice done to animals. And as we shall see shortly, Jesus’s words and actions fare no better. If the prophets represented God’s concern for the disadvantaged and lowly then apparently God was not concerned for them. If these prophets truly represented the moral core of Judaism and Christianity then it doesn’t include any concern for animals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a vision for the future in the book of Isaiah (11:6-9; 65:17-25), which can easily be disputed given the biblical fact that all God’s creatures were not originally vegetarians. Isaiah 11:6-9 says: “The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall feed; their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The sucking child shall play over the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the adder’s den. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.” Isaiah 65:25 says: “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About these passages, Paul Copan in his book, “That’s Just Your Interpretation” (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 2001), p. 229, footnote # 34), rightly points out that Christians “must be cautious about literalizing a poetic and highly symbolic text.” Right that. In Isaiah 65:20 it also says that, “No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days, for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.” If taken literally, Isaiah’s vision for the future still involves death, hardly a description of the supposed original paradise in the Garden of Eden and certainly not that envisioned by the final state of man in heaven. Concerning this verse in its context, Copan argues: “Surely the text does not urge literalism here! It uses understatement to stress the longevity of life during the Messiah’s reign.” Distinguished New Testament scholar and professor of Divinity at Cambridge University, C.F.D. Moule, was referring to Isaiah 65 when he wrote: “No one with a grain of sense believes that the passage…is intended literally, as though the digestive system of a carnivore were going to be transformed into that of a herbivore. What blasphemous injury would be done to great poetry and true mythology by laying such solemnly prosaic hands upon it!” [Man and Nature in the New Testament (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1964), p. 11.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Copan quotes from John Oswalt’s commentary on Isaiah 11:7 where we find the point of the passage is that “the fears associated with insecurity, danger, and evil will be removed.” [Isaiah 1-39, New International Commentary of the Old Testament (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1986), p. 283.]. These passages do not express literal truth even from a biblical perspective. And they are not to be considered prophetic unless it can be shown they were something more than a mere wish for the future. Something yearned for is not a prediction. Anyone can hope for a peaceful paradisiacal future. As such, anyone could write similar poetic things as these. Unless there are explicit dates set for such a prediction to be fulfilled that can be either confirmed or denied such a vision of the future is a mere wish for a blissful future. Even given this hope for the future, the child will not literally play over the hole of a poisonous asp, and neither will the lion nor the ox eat straw. Copan rightly tells us that “the emphasis in these allegedly vegetarian texts is not the nature of the lion’s diet but his domestication, his being tamed so that he is no longer a threat. To eat straw like an ox is to be tamed and not to be a danger.” [Emphasis his]. If, however, the authors of these passages in Isaiah really thought they were describing a literal return to the paradise in the Garden of Eden, then they got it wrong. There was animal predation before the fall as we’ve shown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prophets did speak against the waywardness of God’s people and their tendency to offer a false or insincere formalized worship, along with a condemnation of their unrighteous and unjust ways. They condemned any and all animal sacrifices and formalized worship that did not spring from clean and sincere hearts. The prophetic voice in Psalm 50 typifies this (even though it’s a Psalm). There we read:  “I am God, your God. I do not reprove you for your sacrifices; your burnt offerings are continually before me. I will accept no bull from your house, nor he-goat from your folds. For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. I know all the birds of the air, and all that moves in the field is mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world and all that is in it is mine. Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and pay your vows to the Most High; and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.” What is going on here? According to The Bible Knowledge Commentary : An Exposition of the Scriptures (Wheaton, IL: Victor Books, 1983-1985, Volume 1, page 831), as just one source among many: “God did not reprove them…for their meticulous keeping of the letter of the Law in offering the prescribed sacrifices. But Israel failed to realize that God did not need their bulls or goats (v. 9; cf. v. 13), for He is the Lord of all Creation. He already owns every animal and knows every bird. He instituted the sacrifices not because He needed the animals but because the people desperately needed Him. He is not like the gods of the pagans who supposedly thrived on food sacrifices. The Lord does not depend on man’s worship for survival” (Emphasis mine). This is hardly a text supportive of God’s care for animals. What God wanted from his people is also expressed in Micah 6:6-8. The important thing for God wasn’t their sacrifices, but “to do justice, and to love kindness and to walk humbly” with him as their God. This does not mean God didn’t also demand their sacrifices. He did. He just wanted these sacrifices to come from a pure and sincere worshipful heart. To say God did not demand their sacrifices pits these prophets against the Mosaic law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also read in Isaiah 1:11-17: “‘What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?’ says the Lord; ‘I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of he-goats. When you come to appear before me, who requires of you this trampling of my courts? Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath and the calling of assemblies— I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them. When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.’” Again, there is no care expressed for animals here either, just a condemnation of the injustice of those who made “vain” sacrifices to their God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We even read in Amos (6:4-6) where God is seemingly displeased with the eating of meat by the people in the southern kingdom of Judah: “Woe to those who lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat lambs from the flock, and calves from the midst of the stall; who sing idle songs to the sound of the harp, and like David invent for themselves instruments of music; who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the finest oils, but are not grieved over the ruin of Joseph!” But Amos’s God is confronting his people with a totally unexpected reversal of what the people expected when the so-called “Day of the Lord” comes. They believed God desired sacrifices, and they were right as we’ve seen. We don’t see anywhere in context where God denies this. Instead, God would rather that they do justice and righteousness (v. 24), not to the neglect of their sacrifices, but along with them. They didn’t heed the prophet’s warnings of judgment. They instead indulged themselves in a decadent hedonism. Their sole concern seemed to be for their own gluttonous lifestyle rather than grieve over what had happened to the northern kingdom of Israel who were slaughtered by the Babylonians They showed no concern with their own impending “Day of the Lord” when they will meet with a similar fate. Therefore, Amos says that God says their gluttonous drunken and luxurious lifestyles with come to an end. The sound of their musical revelry will be silenced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert N. Wennberg, Christian professor of philosophy at Westmont College, Santa Barbara, California, sums up what I’m claiming in these words: “To be sure, prophetic condemnation of animal sacrifices occurred from time to time, but the prophetic objection was not directed against animal sacrifices per se; rather, it was an objection to sacrificial offerings in a context devoid of genuine repentance, devoid of compassion for the needy, devoid of a true commitment to justice. It was any ritual divorced from true spirituality, not only animal sacrifice, that was the object of prophetic condemnation.” [God, Humans, and Animals (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003), p. 296].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When God’s judgment does come on people, their animals suffer along with them for their sins. This can be seen first and foremost when we read the story of God sending the ten plagues upon the Egyptians to free the Israelite slaves at the hands of Moses, the supreme prophet of the Old Testament. Water is turned into “blood” and all the fish in the rivers and streams subsequently die. Frogs were made to cover the land and then all but those remaining in the river Nile were destroyed by God. Gnats laid waste to the land, we read. The Egyptian livestock were all killed with a severe pestilence in the fourth plague; all of their horses, their donkeys, their camels, and their flocks of goats and sheep (but then where did they get horses to pull their chariots to chase the Israelites into the Red Sea?). We also see God sending a fifth plague of painful boils (the same kind we read Job was afflicted with), and then a sixth plague of a storm of fire and hail on both the Egyptians and their beasts. (Note: How many times can the Egyptian livestock be punished after they were already killed in the fourth plague!). Then God ends with a scorched earth policy where an eighth plague of locusts devour any and every green plant or tree which might have been left after the storm of hail. The ninth plague of darkness puts a finishing touch on what God had done to the land indicating there was nothing left for the Egyptians. Here we see a wanton divine disregard for animal and plant life (along with human life since the tenth plague was the death of their first-born sons). All of this devastation was done, not because any of the Egyptian’s animals did anything wrong. It was because of the sins of the Egyptians, particularly those of the Pharaoh who refused to free the Israelites. (See Exodus 7-9).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise when a plague of locusts came and devoured the land of God’s own people the prophet Joel (1:18-20) speaks these words: “How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed because there is no pasture for them; even the flocks of sheep are dismayed. Unto thee, O LORD, I cry. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has burned all the trees of the field. Even the wild beasts cry to thee because the water brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.” Surely this is a prophetic metaphor aimed at his people who had fallen under God’s judgment. Again we read in The Bible Knowledge Commentary: An Exposition of the Scriptures (Wheaton, IL: Victor Books, 1983-1985, Volume 1, page 1415): “The people were all too aware (before their very eyes) that their food supply, and with it all reason to rejoice, had disappeared (v. 16). Drought had apparently set in as well, for the seeds had shriveled….With no harvest available, the storehouses and granaries had been left to deteriorate. The domesticated animals (cattle. . . . herds . . . flocks of sheep) were suffering from starvation.” As such, God was punishing nature and with it animals for the sins of man. Again, this is not a text supportive of the care of animals. On the contrary, God punishes animals for the sins of man. (In Hosea 2:18-20 we see a reversal where God promises a covenantal contract with animals, as was done in Noah’s day above, precisely because of the righteousness of human beings).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Testament Passages—Jesus and Animals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the New Testament the treatment of animals seen there fares no better. In fact, it’s claimed that it’s worse. Robert Wennberg acknowledges that the New Testament is not “quite the resource for moral concern for animals that the Old Testament is. This has prompted some to view Judaism as a better friend to animals than Christianity.” [in God, Humans, and Animals (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003), p. 291]. Given what we’ve just seen in the Old Testament this doesn’t look good. Peter Singer charged that while the Old Testament “did at least show flickers of concern for their sufferings,” the New Testament is “completely lacking in any injunction against cruelty to animals, or any recommendation to consider their interests.” [Animal Liberation, p. 191]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is some concern shown in the New testament nonetheless. In the Gospels we read where God feeds the birds of the air (Matthew 6:26; Luke 12:24, 27) and cares for the smallest of sparrows (Luke 12:6-7). But after each of these sayings we subsequently read Jesus saying that human beings are more important to God than they: “Are you not of more value than they?”; and “Of how much more value are you than the birds!”; and “Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Bauckham tries to remedy this understanding of the New Testament texts in a couple of important chapters dealing with Jesus teachings about animals and how he treated them. [Animals on the Agenda, pp. 33-60]. Of the just cited passages he claims: “Only those who recognize birds as their fellow-creatures can appreciate Jesus’ point…it is not an argument which sets humans on a different plane of being from animals. On the contrary, it sets humans within the community of God’s creatures, all of whom are provided for” by God. [Ibid, p. 41]. When it comes to the word “valuable” in these texts where it’s said humans are of much “more value” than these particular animals, Bauckham admits the best interpretation of that word (διαφέρω) is to say humans are “superior” to animals, which is a “hierarchical superiority.” But he comes up with a false analogy to suggest this hierarchical superiority can be compared to a king who is superior to his subjects. There is nothing here to suggest this, nothing. A king is a human being who rules over other human beings. [Ibid, p. 45-46]. And while Bauckham may be correct to suggest these animals have some intrinsic worth to God as the creator and caretaker of them, it doesn’t follow that they have intrinsic value to human beings. Bauckham even admits there were several Old Testament laws where animals were to be regarded as property (see Exodus 21:28-35; Leviticus 24:17-21).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus is also represented as teaching he could heal on the Sabbath by using examples of animals who could be rescued on the Sabbath. Matthew 12:11-12 is typical where Jesus said to his critics, “What man of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out? Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the sabbath.” (See also Luke 14:5; 13:15-16). Such acts were acts of compassion, Bauckham argues, “intended to prevent animal suffering.” [Ibid, pp. 37-38]. Since acts of compassion to help animals are lawful on the Sabbath, so also are acts of compassion toward human being are also lawful, he argues. Of course, here is that same Greek word again, expressing the phrase that humans are of much “more value” (διαφέρω) than these animals. It’s not that animals have no value at all to God or to man, but the kind of value is different for God than for man, as I’ve suggested. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, is this any different than the parable of the man who leaves his flock of a ninety-nine sheep in the open pasture to find the one which was lost, who then rejoices when he does? (Luke 15:4-6) What will he eventually do with his sheep? He will eventually sell it to be killed for a meal or kill it and eat himself. The same thing would go for any sheep that a man rescues from a pit on the Sabbath. The question of what work could be done on the Sabbath day was a legal one, which was disputed in Jesus’ day. Jesus (Mark 12:24-27; John 5:16-18; 7:23), like Paul after him (Acts 17:22-31; 23:6), reportedly used arguments based on what his critics accepted in order to argue his case. Paul did this when in the midst of the Sadducees (the conservatives who believed there was no resurrection of the dead), and the Pharisees (the liberals of their day who did), when he said, “with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial,” which immediately “divided the assembly” until the dissention became “violent.” Jesus was doing the same thing with regard to his “healing” people on the Sabbath. He was using something his critics agreed on to make the point that it was also permissible to heal on the Sabbath. Does this actually mean he cared for sheep? Who knows? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bauckham argues that rescuing a sheep from a pit “cannot be understood as motivated by a concern to preserve the animals as property,” because they were not in any life threatening danger. Would the sheep be in danger of dying if left for a day in a pit? Who knows? Would it suffer harm if left there? Yes. Does this entail a compassion for the animals? Maybe, but it’s not a forgone conclusion given what we know from the majority voices found in the Old Testament itself about the value of animals. If Jesus was indeed expressing some compassion for the individual animal itself, then such an understanding comes from the minority voices in the Old Testament, which I already acknowledged. But surely the desire to keep the sheep from being further harmed could also be understood as a desire to limit any additional loss to the owner of the sheep if not immediately rescued and treated by the owner.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another story in the life of Jesus he encountered a man with a Legion of demons who feared Jesus would cast them out without providing them another host. [The commonly known Latin word “Legion” referred to a Roman army regiment of about 6,000 soldiers.] So the demons begged him to cast them into a herd of swine, which Jesus did. Upon Jesus’ command they “came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.” (Mark 5; Matthew 8:24-34; Luke 8:26-39). It was a common myth that demons needed a host to inhabit, and it was also a common myth that if they couldn’t find a different host after leaving, or being exorcized out of one, they would try to return to the one they left (Mark 9:25; Matthew 12:43-45). Richard Bauckham tells us that upon being cast into the pigs the reason why the pigs were destroyed by the demons is because this “manifests the inherent tendency of the demonic to destroy whatever it possesses (cf. Mark 5:5; 9:22).” [Animals on the Agenda, p. 47]. Bauckham believes these demons could not be sent back into the “abyss” as they requested (Luke 8:31), because until the final end of history evil can only be “deflected and diminished but not abolished,” based on a passage (Matthew 13:24-30) that has nothing to do with these particular demons and what Jesus could or could not do with them as the supposed “Son of God.” So Bauckham merely admits the supposed completely sinless Jesus “permits a lesser evil” here. He says that “the destruction of the pigs is preferable to the destruction of a human personality,” [Ibid., p. 48] as if there were no other alternative options for Jesus who as God’s “Son” was supposedly omnipotent with “all authority over heaven and earth” (Matthew 28:18). I see no reason at all why Jesus, if he is who Bauckham believes he is, couldn’t have sent them back into the “abyss,” as they requested, especially since these demons would have some idea what was possible for him to do. Or, Jesus could have imprisoned these demons in a cave in the mountains, send them into the evil money changers who’s sins may have deserved it, sent them into a murderer condemned to die, or a number of other alternatives. He could even have sent them into the pigs and then kept the demons from drowning them. As it stands this shows a wanton disregard of the “sinless” Jesus toward swine, animals that the Old Testament already declared unclean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few things are sure about Jesus. He was certainly not a vegetarian. We read that in contrast to John the Baptist who came “neither eating nor drinking,” Jesus came “eating and drinking” (Matthew 11:18-19). He would especially eat meat when invited into the homes of some wealthy people (Mark 2:15; Luke 7:36; 11:37; 14:1; and 19:5). We read where Jesus assisted his disciples to catch fish (Luke 5:11), multiplied fish along with some bread for the multitudes to eat (Mark 6:38-43), and it’s even reported after he supposedly resurrected that he prepared a meal of fish for his disciples (John 21:1-4) and even ate fish (Luke 24:42-43). He ate a lamb for the Passover meal every year, certainly at his last supper (Matthew 26:17-20), which had been sacrificed that same day in the Temple. As a good Jew it is almost certain he participated in sacrificing animals to God, which took place during the yearly festivals he attended in Jerusalem (John 2:13; 7:1-10; 10:22-23).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also know Jesus neglected animals when describing the greatest commandments (Mark 12:28-32; Matthew 22.34-40; Luke 10.25-28). He said all the law and prophets could be summed up in two commandments. The first greatest commandment is that we are to love God above all with everything within us. The second greatest commandment was to love our neighbor as ourselves. Jesus said: “There is no other commandment greater than these.” That’s what he said, and he said nothing about caring for animals, or the environment itself as even a distant third, which is what a perfectly good person should have said, if he was perfectly good. To say that loving God includes loving nature and animals doesn’t follow, otherwise Jesus would not have had to mention that we should also love our neighbors as we do ourselves, since if by loving God we should also love our neighbor then the second commandment was superfluous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus is also heard to commission his disciples with a new mandate at the end of the Gospel of Matthew when he commands them to “make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28:16-20). No expressed concern for nature or animals expressed here! The drama of the New Testament is one for the hearts and minds of people whom Jesus died for to atone for their sins. Salvation of men’s souls was of the utmost importance lest they be cast into eternal fire. It was a cosmic battle with the forces of Satan and his evil hosts. It’s this passion for the souls of men that drove the Apostle Paul to suffer much as a missionary for Jesus (II Corinthians 11:23-33). He was after all, not on a mission to alleviate the sufferings of animals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Jesus at the Judgment Day depicted in Matthew 25:31-46, we will be judged by our deeds. That is, if our faith has led us to feeding the poor, being kind to strangers, caring for the sick, clothing the naked, visiting the prisoner, then we will be welcomed into God’s presence in the kingdom. Nothing is said here about caring for animals, nor in James 1:27 where the practice of true religion is “to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.” And nothing is said in the final chapter of the book of Revelation that animals will be in the new Heavenly Jerusalem either. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Testament Passages—Peter, Paul and John the Revelator.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a major shift in the eating habits of Christians in the New Testament. The Jews had already distinguished between the animals they could eat (clean) from the animals they could not eat (unclean). But with a vision of Peter this all changed. In Acts 10:9-16 we read about it. A sheet came down from heaven and in it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. A voice told Peter to rise and eat but Peter refused. Then a voice told him: “What God has cleansed, you must not call common.” This vision in a “trance” was thought by Peter to be a divine instruction that uncircumcised Gentiles who believed would be accepted by God: “Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality, but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.” This same sentiment was written back into the words of Jesus in Mark 7:19. Unlike in the Old Testament all animals were considered fair game for hunting, herding, raising and eating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In I Corinthians 9:9-10 the Apostle Paul wrote in defense of him needing to be given financial help for his ministry by allegorically interpreting an Old Testament passage (Deuteronomy 25:4): “For it is written in the law of Moses, ‘You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain.’ Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of a share in the crop.” The problem here was penned adequately by Robert Wennberg, who said Paul “argues that because we could not suppose that God is concerned with oxen, some alternative meaning must be assigned to this passage….and if God is not concerned with oxen, then by implication God is not concerned with any other animal either.” [God, Humans, and Animals, p. 298]. In reply a Christian interpreter could claim this doesn’t mean Paul’s implication follows, but I don’t see why not, for what could it mean to say that while God was not concerned with oxen other animals were? That hardly makes sense. What’s the difference in moral status between oxen and other animals? Other Christian interpreters may claim Paul was not denying the literal truth of Deuteronomy. He was only describing a deeper truth in addition to the literal truth, but that is quite a stretch. The text does not suggest this as a possibility. Conservative Biblical scholar F.F. Bruce simply bites the bullet here by rejecting attempts to soften the blow of Paul’s words by saying that while Paul’s argument clashes with a modern concern for animals, “he must be allowed to mean what he says.” [New Century Bible: First and Second Corinthians (London: Oliphants, 1971, pp. 84-85].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John the revelator in the book of Revelation, who was probably not John the Apostle, used many different animals in telling his apocalyptic vision for end times. Ninety three verses contain references to lions, bears, dogs, cattle, birds, eagles, a Lamb, serpents, scorpions, locusts, horses, a dragon, and a beast. There is a lot of carnage taking place, mostly by these animals to human beings. They are used by God to inflict pain and suffering. Reading through the book we get the very real impression that the animal world is a hostile word for the most part. Locusts and scorpions torment men, while birds feed on their flesh and the flesh of horses. There is a dragon and a beast (numbering 666) which are at war with believers. The one exception, of course is the Lamb, who represents Jesus who conquers over this hostile animal kingdom and rescues believers. But in the heavenly city when all is said and done we read that the wicked, who are represented as “unclean,” will not be there (Revelation 21:27), and that outside are “the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices lying.” (Revelation 22:15) Using “dogs” to represent wicked people who will be eternally condemned to the lake of fire is surely a disgusting image unbecoming of a caring attitude toward them, even if dogs at that time were scavengers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only expressly positive thing about the New Testament with regard to animals is that because Christians viewed Jesus’ death on the cross as the final sacrifice they no longer had any reason to participate in the Jewish animal sacrificial worship (See the book of Hebrews). This would mean that animal sacrifice was abolished as unnecessary for them. How long it took Christians to actually understand this is not clearly known. We know the Apostle Paul went up to the Temple to offer animal sacrifices when he visited Jerusalem after his third and final missionary journey. In order to help silence his critics the Jerusalem church elders told Paul to show them he still lived “in observance of the law.” Then we read in Acts 21:24-26 that Paul took four men with him “and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for every one of them.” The church had not yet ceased offering animal sacrifices. Presumably Christians came to understand what they did about Jesus’ sacrifice later, after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans around 70 C.E. The Jews themselves ceased offering animals sacrifices after that time as well, so even though Christians ceased offering up animal sacrifices they probably didn’t do so any sooner than the Jews themselves. Even if they did, it would best be understood as an unintended consequence of a developing Christian theology. It was not something that they ceased doing because of any care they might have had for animals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Final Note.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After reviewing a few of the Biblical passages concerning the treatment of animals in the Bible, Christian philosopher Robert Wennberg candidly speaks about what Christians must do to defend holy writ from this appalling lack of concern found in the Bible about animals. He suggests that the defenders of the Bible who are seeking a Biblical basis for a “dramatic revisioning” of Christian attitudes toward animals “are no worse off, possibly better off, than those who in an earlier century turned to Scripture in order to condemn slavery.” [God, Humans, and Animals, pp. 299-302]. He openly admits that “Scripture may seem to have been more of an impediment to the Christian community’s finally making a decisive break with slavery than it was a help,” which I find a major understatement. According to him “there seems to be considerable textual ammunition for the southern white preacher in the 1850’s to rebut attacks on slavery by Christian abolitionists,” but that eventually the abolitionists won the debate. These Christian abolitionist apologists were not “principally seeking to decide whether slavery is right or wrong,” though. They already knew it was wrong and sought a Biblical justification for it, he admits. What necessitated these attempts, he honestly confessed “was the independent conviction that slavery is wrong.” Hence, just as in the case of slavery where the goal of explaining these specific texts “is typically an activity that occurs after we have come to see slavery to be an evil, not before,” so also he challenges the whole Christian community to “come to terms with all of Scripture,” with the goal of arriving at a “thorough and defensible theological vision of animals and their place in the moral universe.” [Ibid., p. 308].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such a goal as Wennberg proposes is called special pleading, pure and simple. The conclusion has already been reached. Now find the reasons for accepting it in the texts of the Bible. As I’ve argued in this chapter the Biblical texts do not support Wennberg’s animal concern. The truly intellectually honest thing to do, in my opinion, would be to seek to understand what the Bible actually teaches rather than force it to fit inside the grid of anti-slavery, pro-feminism, or animal advocacy concerns. Only after being candidly honest with the texts themselves will he be able to be intellectually honest when thinking about God and the Bible. My claim is that we do not see much of a concern at all for animals in the Bible. It truly is anthropocentric to the core. And as such it’s not indicative at all of what a perfectly good God would reveal to us. If God was truly concerned for the welfare of animals he would’ve said, “Thou shalt not mistreat, abuse or kill animals,” and said it as often as he needed to without giving any conflicting advice. Then God’s people could not justify the ill treatment of them down through the centuries. Then there would be nothing to reform, since there wouldn’t be such wanton abuse, organized abuse, of them in his world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-782806335360188444?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

If you get a automated note saying your comment is spam, don’t worry! I’ll make sure it gets in the list.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve done a BABlog giveaway, so it’s way overdue. And this time I have another &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; cool (in the geeky sense) book to give away to one BABloggee: &lt;em&gt;The Saucer Fleet&lt;/em&gt;, by Jack Hagerty and Jon Rogers (Jack is the author of the also way-cool &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/27/ba-giveaway-number-5/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spaceship Handbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is so incredibly cool: it’s all about flying saucers in movies, including War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, This Island Earth, The Day The Earth Stood Still, and many more. It’s lavishly illustrated, phenomenally detailed, and is simply totally awesome. It also has a forward by some astronomer who loves old science fiction movies. Oh wait: it’s &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. And there’s more: Jack will autograph the book to the winner, too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you like flying saucer stuff? &lt;em&gt;You want this book.&lt;/em&gt; Don’t believe me? Then listen to &lt;a href="http://www.sfwriter.com/2009/02/saucer-fleet.html"&gt;scifi author Robert Sawyer&lt;/a&gt;, or the Hive Overmind blog &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/sciencenotfiction/2009/02/10/the-saucer-fleet/"&gt;Science Not Fiction&lt;/a&gt;. If you like saucer movies, this book &lt;em&gt;rocks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you win it? Actually, it’s pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you have to do is leave a comment on this post. Just post something in the comments below, like &amp;quot;I’m a geek and I want this book!&amp;quot; It doesn’t matter what you post as long as you post something. On Friday, March 20 at noon Mountain time (UTC - 6), I will generate a random number, and the person who leaves that number comment wins the book. I’ll send the winner an email notifying them of their good fortune, and you’ll have until Monday at noon MT to get back to me. I’ll pick another commenter if I don’t hear back by then. That person will have until noon the next day to get back to me, and so one, until a winner is chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some rules for you. READ THESE. Violate them and you’re toast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Leave a comment &lt;strong&gt;ONLY ONCE&lt;/strong&gt;. I trust you folks, but I feel I must make this warning: No matter how tempting it is to followup on someone else’s comment, &lt;em&gt;don’t do it&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone caught doing that (or cheating in any way) not only won’t win the book, but your comment will simply be deleted. Be ye fairly warned, says I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Make sure that you enter a valid email address in the form when you leave your comment. If you don’t, you won’t win, since email is how I will contact the winner. I won’t try to figure out your address; if there’s no valid email, I’ll simply pick another winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Anyone is eligible. However, to be fair, if you’re an actual friend of mine IRL then please don’t leave a comment. I’ll leave it up to your own judgment if you fall in that category or not. I just wouldn’t feel right sending the book to a friend when the contest is open to anyone. Luckily, I have so few friends the odds are low anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004909" title=""&gt;The Spatial and Temporal Construction of Confidence in the Visual Scene&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human subjects can report many items of a cluttered field a few hundred milliseconds after stimulus presentation. This memory decays rapidly and after a second only 3 or 4 items can be stored in working memory. Here we compared the dynamics of objective performance with a measure of subjective report and we observed that 1) Objective performance beyond explicit subjective reports (blindsight) was significantly more pronounced within a short temporal interval and within specific locations of the visual field which were robust across sessions 2) High confidence errors (false beliefs) were largely confined to a small spatial window neighboring the cue. The size of this window did not change in time 3) Subjective confidence showed a moderate but consistent decrease with time, independent of all other experimental factors. Our study allowed us to asses quantitatively the temporal and spatial access to an objective response and to subjective reports.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004869" title=""&gt;Distinct Regions of Right Temporo-Parietal Junction Are Selective for Theory of Mind and Exogenous Attention&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, a cortical region in the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) is recruited when participants read stories about people's thoughts ('Theory of Mind'). Both fMRI and lesion studies suggest that a region near the RTPJ is associated with attentional reorienting in response to an unexpected stimulus. Do Theory of Mind and attentional reorienting recruit a single population of neurons, or are there two neighboring but distinct neural populations in the RTPJ? One recent study compared these activations, and found evidence consistent with a single common region. However, the apparent overlap may have been due to the low resolution of the previous technique. We tested this hypothesis using a high-resolution protocol, within-subjects analyses, and more powerful statistical methods. Strict conjunction analyses revealed that the area of overlap was small and on the periphery of each activation. In addition, a bootstrap analysis identified a reliable 6-10 mm spatial displacement between the peak activations of the two tasks; the same magnitude and direction of displacement was observed in within-subjects comparisons. In all, these results suggest that there are neighboring but distinct regions within the RTPJ implicated in Theory of Mind and orienting attention.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004867" title=""&gt;Offline Memory Reprocessing: Involvement of the Brain's Default Network in Spontaneous Thought Processes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Spontaneous thought processes (STPs), also called daydreaming or mind-wandering, occur ubiquitously in daily life. However, the functional significance of STPs remains largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we first identified an STPs-network whose activity was positively correlated with the subjects' tendency of having STPs during a task-free state. The STPs-network was then found to be strongly associated with the default network, which has previously been established as being active during the task-free state. Interestingly, we found that offline reprocessing of previously memorized information further increased the activity of the STPs-network regions, although during a state with less STPs. In addition, we found that the STPs-network kept a dynamic balance between functional integration and functional separation among its component regions to execute offline memory reprocessing in STPs. These findings strengthen a view that offline memory reprocessing and STPs share the brain's default network, and thus implicate that offline memory reprocessing may be a predetermined function of STPs. This supports the perspective that memory can be consolidated and modified during STPs, and thus gives rise to a dynamic behavior dependent on both previous external and internal experiences.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harris Interactive conducted a telephone survey for the &lt;a href="http://www.calacademy.org/http://www.calacademy.org/"&gt;California Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. The full results are not yet available (at least I could not find them anywhere), but here are some highlights in the press release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 53% of adults know how long it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun.&lt;br&gt;
Only 59% of adults know that the earliest humans and dinosaurs did not live at the same time.&lt;br&gt;
Only 47% of adults can roughly approximate the percent of the Earth’s surface that is covered with water.&lt;br&gt;
Only 21% of adults answered all three questions correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is pretty horrific, but in line with prior surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discuss science education occasionally on this blog. There is a strong consensus that the US is doing a poor job of science education, but not as much of one when it comes to what would be an effective solution. These surveys make me feel, however, that my discussions of how to get from mediocre to high quality science education may be largely irrelevant, because we’re not even up to mediocre yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I recently discussed the difference between depth of science education vs breadth, and concluded that we need a thoughtful blend of both. I am not sure how relevant this is, however, to people who do not even know that it takes a year for the earth to go around the sun - who could not even pick “1 year” out of a multiple choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “teaching facts vs teaching theories” discussion also frequently comes up among those who wish to optimize science education. Again, I feel a thoughtful combination of both is optimal, but what about people who have learned neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surveys such as this suggest is that we need to fix some basic problems with education itself, not just science education specifically. I am not suggesting that we do not also simultaneously take steps to improve science education at the high end. These are complementary goals - we need to increase the basic level of scientific literacy in society, as well as produce more science nerds to fill high-end jobs and research positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, there is a disconnect between the public’s respect for science and their understanding of it. According to the survey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 4 in 5 adults think science education is “absolutely essential” or “very important” to the U.S. healthcare system (86%), the U.S. global reputation (79%), and the U.S. economy (77%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this says to me is that people want the benefits of science, but many think that science is something that other (more nerdy) people do.  But they don’t have to make any effort to understand themselves even the most basic knowledge of the natural world. These are the &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8785701997189530908"&gt;Sherri Shepherds&lt;/a&gt; of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a metaquestion raised by this survey is how good these surveys are themselves. What do they really tell us? If anything they overestimate scientific literacy because they are multiple choice - so some of the percentage correct were due to lucky guessing. Also, they don’t really test scientific understanding, just random bits of scientific trivia. There probably is some correlation between knowing basic science facts and being interested in and understanding science, but these are not the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to see a survey that asks more probing questions about how science is supposed to work. For example, how many people know what a double-blind study is, or could answer why double-blinding is important in clinical trials?  What percentage of the US could give a cogent definition of science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These surveys don’t tell us what percentage of the population has a working scientific knowledge - where they can use logic, knowledge of the process of science, and a fund of basic factual knowledge to think clearly and critically about new scientific claims.  Shouldn’t that be at least one goal of science education?&lt;/p&gt;

They ran excellent programs like Nova and Masterpiece Theatre and I felt I could count on finding good programming when I tuned into my local PBS channel. No more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was bad enough when they started featuring Deepak Chopra, self-help programs, and “create your own reality” New Age philosophy, but at least it was obvious what those programs were about. What is really frightening is that now they are running programs for fringe medical claims and they are allowing viewers to believe that they are hearing cutting edge science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurologist Robert Burton has written excellent articles for salon.com pointing out the questionable science presented by doctors &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/mind_reader/2008/05/12/daniel_amen/index.html"&gt;Daniel Amen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/mind_reader/2009/03/12/mark_hyman/index.html"&gt;Mark Hyman&lt;/a&gt; in their PBS programs. Please click on the links and read what he wrote. These programs are being shown during fundraising drives as if they were examples of the best PBS has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people (myself included) protested to our local stations and to the PBS ombudsman. The ombudsman basically said those are not PBS programs and the local stations choose whether to run them. PBS doesn’t take any responsibility for their content – but how are viewers to know that? There is no disclaimer, and the PBS logo has sometimes appeared on the screen during these programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBS is providing airtime to fringe practitioners for what amounts to infomercials. They are lending their cachet to ideas that are not accepted by mainstream science, and they are not giving their viewers any clue that these ideas are not generally accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One commenter on the salon.com website said, “I worked at a PBS station in Tampa for several years and I can tell you the reason they run that crap - it’s because it pays the bills. Unlike every other show on the station (like Nova and American Experience) the station gets a check when the show airs instead of having to pay to air it.” If this is true, it is reprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If PBS really wanted to support good science, it would not air these infomercials. If it insists on airing them, it should at least provide a disclaimer and make it clear that the programs are not endorsed by PBS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burton says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently PBS’s mission is to raise money by exploiting viewers’ gullibility at the expense of trustworthy programming. If so, it has achieved its goal — and undermined the central reason for having educational TV in the first place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame on you, PBS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to join the letter writing campaign, you can write your local station, citing Dr. Burton’s articles, and contact &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/ombudsman/"&gt;the PBS ombudsman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Chelation is one of the numerous biomedical treatments that parents of autistic children have turned to, in the hopes of "treating" their child. Numerous concerns have been raised about the &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/dr-bock-on-chelation-safety/"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; of chelation; last year, an &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/chelation-study-put-on-hold/"&gt;NIMH study&lt;/a&gt; was called off for this very reason.  The March 13th &lt;a href="http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=10003567"&gt;News Channel 5&lt;/a&gt; raises concerns about chelation after the death last year of 6-year-old Anna Starr, who had epilepsy. An autopsy stated that Anna's death was "natural" and caused by a seizure disorder. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, nearly a year later, investigators served a search warrant on what used to be the &lt;a href="http://www.proactivemed.org/"&gt;Center For Proactive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, a clinic on music row [in Nashville]. The warrant raises questions about the role alternative therapies played in Anna's death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators were looking for evidence of child abuse and criminally negligent homicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the search warrant, Anna received chelation therapy, an alternative treatment for epilepsy, just days before she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Anna's parents, Fred and Sarah Starr, who are both doctors, claimed that Anna's 2 1/2 year old brother "no longer had autism because of a series of alternative therapies"; 2 1/2 is an age when children tend to be diagnosed with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 23, 2005, &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/parents-of-boy-who-died-after-chelation-sue-doctor-and-apothecure/"&gt;Abubakar Tariq Nadama&lt;/a&gt; died after receiving treatment in the office of Pennsylvania Dr. Roy Kerry.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld a district court ruling, saying the law is constitutional because it expressly allows for any silent use of the period, either religious or nonreligious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2003 law allows children to “reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activities” for one minute at the beginning of each school day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-align:center;display:block"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/texas-mandates-the-silencing-of-students/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/mlv7Bp-L2MM/2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course no informed individual can honestly claim that it is an important part of a child’s education and a beneficial use of our tax dollars to give the students quiet time. In fact, I would very much like to hear why so many people were SOOOOOOOOO passionate in fighting for mandatory “shut your mouth” time (more so than for better textbooks or for better resources), because they can’t give a reason as this is just a thinly veiled excuse to give the children of Christian parents preferential treatment. In fact, it’s so thinly veiled that prayer is even mentioned in the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/local/southeast_texas_schools_approve_of__moment_of_silence__law_03-16-2009.html"&gt;Here’s an article that supports the new law&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the one minute wedged between the pledge to Texas and American flags and the school day, Christine Michael prays to God for safety and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To be watched over throughout the day and the week to be protected, not just for me, but for everyone,” said Michael, an 18-year-old senior at West Brook High School and outspoken Christian (which, incidentally, is also the pronunciation of his name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With or without the state-mandated minute of silence, Michael said he would still pray each morning, but the dedicated quiet time gives him a moment to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s not that I’ve been told to do that or someone has asked me to do it,” he said. “It’s just what I feel I should do.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if this student would be praying with or without the law why was the law forcing everyone else to let her focus necessary??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/court_affirms_texas_schools_mo.html"&gt;Oh, and here’s the kicker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circuit Judge Edith Brown Clement noted the lawmaker who sponsored the moment of silence bill expressed a desire to add prayer to Texas’ existing statute after the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals found a similar law in Virginia was constitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SON OF A BITCH!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope Texas students decide to practice their mime or juggling lessons in front of the students of Christian parents, especially if they’re terrible jugglers and stand beside those other students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people have flocked to a Roman Catholic church on the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion after believers said they saw the “face of Christ” in the pleats of a church cushion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antoinette, an 82-year-old parishioner, said the face was a “divine phenomenon” as tears welled up her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This church is a holy site,” added Lise-May, another worshipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! That is phenomenally delusional. I mean, come on! It’s obviously the divine image of John Lennon.&lt;/p&gt;

The talk was a slightly more technical version of the public lecture - Modern Cosmology and the Building Blocks of the Universe - that I have given in many different places over the last few years, and at this point I’m quite comfortable with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am more nervous giving talks to amateur astronomers than to any other group. This is because, for a cosmologist, I know remarkably little about astronomy. It isn’t that I’m a complete ignoramus, but just that my knowledge is relatively rudimentary, and amounts to less than the content of an undergraduate astronomy degree, although I do know some extra things about a few advanced topics. My training is in mathematics and physics, and I’ve basically picked up the astronomy I know through necessity either because of research topics or teaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I bravely soldiered on, and the DVAA crowd proved to be quite delightful. My talk begins with a brief tour of the major pillars of the big bang theory - the Hubble expansion law, the microwave background radiation, and the abundances of the light elements - then proceeds with a summary of open questions. This is then followed by a discussion of the challenges these pose for fundamental physics, and some of the possible solutions and how they may be tested in upcoming experiments. In particular, I focus on candidates for dark matter, and their possible origin in beyond the standard model physics at the TeV scale, on models of baryogenesis, and on the logical possibilities for the origin of cosmic acceleration - the cosmological constant, dynamical dark energy and modified gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is a cursory treatment, since a detailed discussion isn’t really what people expect from a public lecture. And there are huge numbers of topics I’d love to touch on but just don’t have time for, like inflation, and topological defects, and extra dimensions, and … You get the picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when you’re speaking to an audience like this one, people tend to already have questions about all kinds of things that you didn’t explicitly mention in the talk. And not just any questions, but subtle and technical ones. So afterwards I spent a while discussing the status of tests of the inflationary paradigm, the anthropic principle and its implementation through eternal inflation in the string theory landscape, the problem of measure in the multiverse, and other related topics. Not your usual collection of post-public lecture questions, and a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mark Liberman recently &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1227"&gt;wrote in Language Log&lt;/a&gt; that, for everyone except linguists and a few exceptionally old-fashioned intellectuals, what "passive voice" now means is "construction that is vague as to agency". Disturbingly, a short &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2009/03/23/090323ta_talk_franklin"&gt;piece by Nancy Franklin&lt;/a&gt; in the March 23, 2009, issue of The New Yorker seems to bear that out.  It is a discussion of Bernard Madoff's allocution, his formal court statement acknowledging guilt:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;Two sentences later, Madoff said, &amp;quot;When I began the Ponzi scheme, I believed it would end shortly and I would be able to extricate myself and my clients from the scheme.&amp;quot; As he read this, he betrayed no sense of how absurd it was to use the passive voice in regard to his scheme, as if it were a spell of bad weather that had descended on him. Still, he had faith-he &amp;quot;believed&amp;quot;!-that it would soon be over. Yes, &amp;quot;soon.&amp;quot; In most of the rest of the statement, one not only heard the aggrieved passive voice but felt the hand of a lawyer:  &amp;quot;To the best of my recollection, my fraud began in the early nineteen-nineties.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;If there is an example of the passive voice in Madoff's quoted statements, it has escaped my attention.  Unlike the blog Liberman cites, The New Yorker reportedly has professionally edited text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The &amp;quot;passive voice&amp;quot; spotted in the first Madoff quote is apparently the phrase &amp;quot;it would end shortly&amp;quot;, which is technically an active-voice intransitive, but one where (as Franklin observes) Madoff is evading the fact that the scheme could end if and only if he himself took steps to end it — or, on the most charitable interpretation, if his investment strategy miraculously began to work as he falsely claimed it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's an interesting twist towards the end of the paragraph. In recording the mutation of the term "passive voice", I've been focusing on the way that the word &lt;em&gt;passive&lt;/em&gt; has gradually lost its technical grammatical meaning, and taken on a sense crystallizing around notions of passive as "unassertive", "lacking in force", "failing to take responsibility for what happens", "submissive". But Franklin's reference to "the aggrieved passive voice" made me realize that the word &lt;em&gt;voice&lt;/em&gt; has undergone a similar change in popular usage, losing its technical grammatical meaning in favor of the ordinary-language sense "mode or style of expression".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to know what the historical trajectory of these changes has been. Presumably the grammatical meaning of "passive voice" became unstable in popular usage when grammatical analysis stopped being taught. I believe that with respect to English, this started happening early in the 20th century, though perhaps people continued to pick up some grammatical terminology for a while longer in learning foreign languages, until grammatical analysis was no longer taught in that context either. The knowledge probably lingered longest in Latin courses, but increasingly smaller portions of the population were involved. Despite the lack of any basis for understanding its meaning, I conjecture that the term "passive voice" continued in popular use due to the many stylistic injunctions to avoid it, so that a complex of more-or-less incoherent ideas were evoked to characterize what it is that writers are supposed to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002398.html"&gt;Eleanor Gould Packard&lt;/a&gt;, the New Yorker's "Grammarian" for 54 years, would have written in the margins of Franklin's submission. According to David Remnick's &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/02/28/050228ta_talk_remnick"&gt;obituary for her&lt;/a&gt;, "she could find a solecism in a Stop sign", and "once found what she believed were four grammatical errors in a three-word sentence".  But I haven't been able to find any information about whether or not she knew what "passive voice" meant.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237251293336"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/the_blog_and_the_book.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/06d8bbfa87a4d6ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Blog and... the Book!</title><published>2009-03-17T00:32:54Z</published><updated>2009-03-17T00:32:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/699Nr-Eepf4/the_blog_and_the_book.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/the_blog_and_the_book.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; I'd like to apologize for the slowness of the blog. Fortunately,
there's a very good reason: I've got a book contract! "Good Math" will
be published by "The Pragmatic Programmers" press. The exact
publication date isn't set yet, but my schedule plans for a complete
draft of the book by summer. (And I used the scheduling rules proposed by one
of my favorite managers. He said that when a programmer gives you an estimate
of how long something should take, multiply it by two and increase the unit. So
if they say it'll take a day, assume two weeks. If they say a week, assume
two months. In my experience, it's actually a really good predictor.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Anyway... For the last couple of weeks, I've been setting up a new
computer to use for writing the book (gotta keep my Google work and my
private work separate!), finishing the first three chapters, and trying to get
comfortable with the PP markup system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While I'm working on the book, I'm going to be posting drafts of
some sections as posts on the blog. As a result, you'll see some
re-runs of older posts in a slightly different format. There will also
be some brand new material in the book format. The book draft
posts will be clearly marked, and for those, even more than usual, I'd
appreciate feedback and corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Of course, I&amp;#39;ll also be posting non-book related stuff. For example, I hope to
have a new data structures post ready this evening. As a result of my work on
the book, I&amp;#39;m back on a Haskell binge, and I&amp;#39;m working up a post about a
fascinating functional data structure called a finger-tree./p&amp;gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the Beginning...&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetics has had an awesome impact on our understanding of basic processes like circadian rhythms, which were mysterious before the incredibly successful marriage between genetics and recombinant DNA technology about 30 years ago. Subsequent to the pioneering work of Konopka and Benzer [1], genetic screens and DNA sequencing in multiple systems (including but not limited to humans, mice, Drosophila, Neurospora, plants, and cyanobacteria) identified many circadian genes as well as their protein sequences. Coupled with PCR methods to bootstrap from one system to another (e.g., [2,3]), this strategy also revealed that many clock proteins are shared between systems. For example, mammals and Drosophila use orthologs to construct their clocks [4-6]. Fly proteins include the PAS domain-containing transcription factor heterodimer Clock-Cycle (CLK-CYC [orthologs in mammals: CLK-BMAL1]) and the negative regulator Period (PER [orthologs in mammals: PER1, PER2]). These relationships indicate that a similar, basic clock mechanism was present in a common ancestor, before the separation of insects and mammals more than 500 million years ago. Some argue that the relationship of basic clock mechanism and proteins extends to Neurospora [7,8], which would push back the common ancestor date even further. (I am assuming that horizontal gene transfer is not responsible for the commonalities between systems.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, however, no evidence that this relationship extends across the animal-bacterial kingdom divide; i.e., the key circadian proteins of mammals appear completely unrelated to the key circadian proteins of cyanobacteria. Although negative evidence must be interpreted with great caution ("absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"), there is no relationship evident between the circadian proteins of cyanobacteria and those of mammals [4,9]. As this is not the case for many other classes of proteins, the strong suggestion is that circadian rhythms have arisen at least twice, once in an ancestor of present-day cyanobacteria and then again in an ancestor of animals. (More than two evolutionary origins are also possible, as the different set of plant circadian proteins may indicate a third independent origin; although see below.) As some early version of cyanobacteria are generally credited with the rise of oxygen about 2.4 billion years ago, and multicellular eukaryotes did not appear for another 1.5 billion years or so [10], the evolution of cyanobacterial rhythms was probably well before that of eukaryotic rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Importance of Biochemistry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multiple-origin view of circadian clock origins has implications for how animal clocks keep time; i.e., what are their mechanisms or "quartz crystals"? In other words, progress in one system may have no impact on understanding a second. Relevant also is the fact that genetics is a poor way to define mechanism, in contrast to its irrefutable value in identifying key genes and proteins. These sequences are seductive, as a link between a circadian gene and a transcription factor can be interpreted to indicate an intimate relationship between transcription and timekeeping (e.g., [11]). However, only biochemistry can rigorously define mechanism, and nowhere is the distinction with genetics better illustrated than in the breathtaking reconstruction of a cyanobacterial clock in vitro [12].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000066" title=""&gt;Exploring the 'Global Workspace' of Consciousness&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As an explanatory principle in biology, vitalism has long been in decline, as one discovery after another revealed that mechanisms provide convincing explanations--hearts are pumps, genes are code--for all manner of life's phenomena. But even through the 20th century, the mind has been vitalism's last redoubt, because there has been no simple, satisfactory, mechanistic explanation of the most puzzling aspect of the mind: the nature of conscious awareness. For many years, even asking questions about the inner workings of this mental black box was taboo among some groups of scientists.

&lt;p&gt;But that has all changed. A flood of new discoveries in every area of neuroscience has led to competing models of consciousness, and most importantly, testable hypotheses. A new study by Raphael Gaillard, Lionel Naccache, and colleagues provides support for one such model by showing that conscious, but not nonconscious, visual information is rapidly and widely distributed across the brain, provoking the synchronized brain activity that is the hallmark of conscious processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000051" title=""&gt;Media Portrayals of Suicide&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a cohort study in this month's PLoS Medicine, Nav Kapur (University of Manchester, United Kingdom) and colleagues report that young men (24 years and under) who had left the UK Armed Forces were at higher risk of suicide than either young men in the general population or those still in active service [1]. The risk appeared to be greatest in the first two years after discharge, in those with a short length of service, and in those of lower rank. There was a low rate of contact with mental health specialists in the year before death--just 14% for those under 20 years and 20% for those under 24 years. This study has identified a vulnerable group and highlights the need for targeted intervention to save lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_biolo_36.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/WQ-2DyJKxv8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237250382026"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/latex_fan_you_can_now_use_your.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/628a10d3f2e9f52e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="PLoS"/><title type="html">LaTeX fan?

(It's ranked #32 in &lt;em&gt;Christianity Today's &lt;/em&gt;list of "Top 50 Books That Have Shaped Evangelicals.") On March 7, Wilkerson posted an &lt;a href="http://www.worldchallenge.org/coverletter/an_urgent_message"&gt;"urgent message"&lt;/a&gt;. It began:&lt;span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;AN EARTH-SHATTERING CALAMITY IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. IT IS GOING TO BE SO FRIGHTENING, WE ARE ALL GOING TO TREMBLE — EVEN THE GODLIEST AMONG US. For ten years I have been warning about a thousand fires coming to New York City. It will engulf the whole megaplex, including areas of New Jersey and Connecticut. Major cities all across America will experience riots and blazing fires — such as we saw in Watts, Los Angeles, years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will be riots and fires in cities worldwide. There will be looting — including Times Square, New York City. What we are experiencing now is not a recession, not even a depression. We are under God's wrath.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Then at the end he wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Note: I do not know when these things will come to pass, but I know it is not far off. I have unburdened my soul to you. Do with the message as you choose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wait just a minute! Why pick on major cities here? Why not some small towns instead? And doesn't this already describe certain streets in NYC anyway? Besides, why are preachers like him so interested in a doom and gloom message? Is it that they are secretly upset at Americans and want them to suffer and die? Is it to raise money? Is there some correlation with a rise in gifts when the message is one of doom and gloom?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how can we hold Wilkerson's face to the floor on this prediction? Is it too vague to do so? The subtitle says that "An Earth-Shattering Calamity Is About To Happen." Earth shattering? I'm sure we would all recognize this if it happened, right? Is the time limit for the prediction too vague? Why is this an "urgent" message if the events are not to happen for another year? What does the word "urgent" in "urgent message" mean? And if it does not happen in Wilkerson's lifetime will the Christian community rise up as one and denouce him as a false prophet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ha, ha. I know the answers. This would be sad if it weren't so damn funny. As far as I know if we just laugh hard enough at him we may find Wilkerson and some members of his church secretly trying to start these fires and looting themselves just to get the ball rolling!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-1138112995198532252?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The article analyzes a number of key issues related to autistic adults with any range of abilities and disabilities, including, among an number of other critical items, autism's history relative to older generations of adults, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating researchers' attempts to get at the core issues that determine the quality of life for adults with autism is the disorder's short history. Autism-like disorders were described for the first time, in the United States and Austria, only two generations ago, and the defining characteristics are still rapidly evolving today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent past, children with severe autistic symptoms likely faced years of institutionalization. They were diagnosed with mental illness, most commonly childhood schizophrenia or infantile psychosis, reflecting the prevailing theory that autism-related disorders in children represented the early onset of adult psychosis. Not until the 1970s did autism begin to emerge as its own disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;issues with housing and support, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shortage of employment and housing assistance, and other services, hinders what otherwise might be a relatively high level of independence – not only improving the quality of life for individuals with ASDs and their families, but also saving the costs of providing a lifetime of public services to adults who want to become productive members of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"catch-22's" like having to choose between employment and support, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One man participating in the study, who lived in a hostel, expressed a desire to live more independently; however, though he was skilled in his profession as a charcoal burner, he couldn’t afford to move elsewhere. Another man, this one working in a graveyard, faced the difficult choice of giving up his job to move into assisted-living housing or keeping the job he preferred and continuing to live at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the need for better training in self-advocacy and self-determination,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most important of all, we need to reach the adults with autism themselves and ask: What are your goals? Which supports are helpful (and which are not)? Where do you want to live? How can society make you feel more at home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2004 UK study is quoted as saying, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[D]edicated services for adults with autism would not seem to have kept pace with the growth in specialist educational provision for children. A focus on access to more extensive and appropriate supported living and employment schemes could help to ensure much greater progress in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems that face adults on the spectrum today are starting to be clearly defined.  The next step will be to figure out some solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237242746958"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ode_to_family">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8802b681c011c28b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Ode to Family</title><published>2009-03-16T22:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T22:28:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ode_to_family" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3361338492/" title="On the bus, going to Mycenae by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3361338492_d552a1debc_m.jpg" height="180" alt="On the bus, going to Mycenae" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Boy, am I feeling lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking of &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/fashion/05grandparents-1.html?ref=style"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; in last week's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/fashion/05grandparents-1.html?ref=style"&gt;New York TImes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/fashion/05grandparents-1.html?ref=style"&gt;When Grandma Can't Be Bothered&lt;/a&gt;. That title says it all----not every grandmother is ready to be like Marian Robinson (the First Grandmother?) and give up her job and everything and move in to take care oft he grandkids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, Robinson is moving into some pretty nice digs and there's a full roster of staff to assist in vacuuming, grocery shopping, and the like. Still I've long nodded on reading about Robinson taking care of her granddaughters, rather than a nanny (nothing against nannies, necessarily!). My own parents---known to Charlie by their Cantonese names, Gong Gong and Po Po----are Important People #3 and #4, after Jim and me (Dad and Mom, you can vie for who gets the #3 spot). My parents live in California but have always come to see us at least four or five times a year, and we always spend the winter holidays in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, my mom and dad are pretty much Charlie's main/only babysitters, though things have changed. Charlie was long ago taller than my mom and he's catching up rapidly on my dad. They showed up in St. Louis where Charlie was born as soon as they could find a flight. When we took Charlie out of school in the fall of 2005 as there was not appropriate placement for him, my mom flew right out and lived with us --- sharing the same room as Charlie, in fact --- until Charlie went back to a new school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who else glad agreed to come to New Jersey in the waning of winter for two weeks to help Jim take care of Charlie while I've been away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we don't have a whole village raising Charlie but we have a good-sized family (including a long-lost relative of mine who's originally from Jersey City)---and just wanted to say thanks for joining us and helping us on this long journey. I know I'm able to be here (in Olympia today, site of the ancient Olympic Games in honor of the god Zeus) thanks to good family ties and, especially, our &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;tight team of three&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237237433365"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/16/how-do-we-know-he-didnt-invent-the-thing/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/05b7353588453743</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">“How do we know he didn’t invent the thing?”</title><published>2009-03-16T21:01:14Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T21:01:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/16/how-do-we-know-he-didnt-invent-the-thing/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312180838.htm"&gt;Science Daily is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that a team led by Artem Oganov (Stony Brook University) and Yanming Ma (Jilin University in China) have discovered something pretty cool: at pressures of about 3 million atmospheres, sodium becomes transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, at room temperature and pressure, sodium is an opaque, whitish metal. At higher pressure, over a million times the Earth’s atmospheric pressure, it turns black. And at 1.9 million atmospheres it starts to becomes transparent at red wavelengths. Although it hasn’t been directly shown, the scientists expect at 3 million atmospheres it will becomes as transparent as glass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason this is so interesting is that, for one, it wasn’t predicted until recently. No one knew what would happen to sodium under such pressures. I read the explanation of what’s going on at the link above, and as I understand it metals are opaque because they have electrons that are free to flow around the atoms in the metal. Electrons are very good at absorbing light, so metals are opaque (as well as good conductors due to the free electrons). At very high pressures, the electrons get locked up in spaces between the atoms and cannot move. This allows light to pass through the material (and I assume makes them insulators as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting aspect of this is that pressures like this are common deep inside planets. How heat gets transferred out from the cores of planets depends in part on how well light can pass through the materials, so anything that furthers our knowledge of this will help understand how planets work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium is not a material that, by itself, can be used in construction and so on, like, say, aluminum. But how far are we &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_aluminum#Star_Trek"&gt;from proving Scotty right&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237234549073"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/perverse_incentives.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa3d868910cdb956</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Economics"/><title type="html">Perverse Incentives</title><published>2009-03-16T18:36:05Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T18:36:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/aoHdFsXfFRs/perverse_incentives.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/perverse_incentives.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; A lot of people, reading the reporting on the current financial
disaster, have been writing me to ask what people mean when they talk
about incentives. The traders, the bankers, the fund managers, and all
of the other folks involved in this giant cluster-fuck aren't
stupid. So naturaly, the question keeps coming up, why would they go
along with it? And the answer that we keep hearing is something along
the lines of "perverse incentives".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The basic idea is that the way that the people in the industry got paid,

At 07:14 UT it’ll pass about 800 meters (about half a mile) from the ISS, much closer than &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/breaking-small-but-finite-chance-iss-to-be-hit-by-debris/"&gt;last week’s 5 km (3 miles) miss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is close enough that NASA is considering firing onboard jets to maneuver the ISS away from the debris. They’ll decide that by 20:00 (UT) tonight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shuttle is on its way to the ISS but won’t be there until tomorrow, long after the danger has passed. Come to think of it, the best time to be threatened by debris is when the Shuttle is almost there. However, it’s not like the Shuttle can do much; the physics of orbital mechanics makes a daring rescue very unlikely. I doubt they have enough fuel on board to accelerate to the ISS, decelerate to match velocities, and do the deorbit burn to get back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the best scenario is to avoid collision (the same is true for asteroid impacts). They’re tracking this, so we’ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic of Lyme disease has come up &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/whitecoatunderground/2009/03/does_lyme_disease_make_you_sho.php"&gt;recently in the press&lt;/a&gt;, and as the weather improves, cases in the northeastern U.S. should start to increase soon.  Just as a reminder, so-called “chronic” Lyme disease is not Lyme disease at all.  Lyme disease can have early and late manifestations, none of which correspond to the vague, protean symptoms labeled as “chronic” by some.  The disease is often diagnosed without resort to objective evidence, such as reliable, positive lab tests.  But let’s look at the blog post in question and see what’s there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds as if the writer of this piece has dealt with some terrible suffering, but the explanation she has reached for it is rather odd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came by my own ringside seat at these festivities courtesy of a tick bite incurred, probably on a hiking trail somewhere in the Sierra, in the late summer of 1984. I don’t remember the bite. I never saw the tell-tale bulls-eye rash (I’m a country kid — I got bit all the time by one noxious thing or another) that one of the warring camps insists must be present for a Lyme diagnosis to be accurate. But I do know that I went to bed one day in October of that year, and was never the same afterward — and that I’ve been struggling with devastating bouts of exhaustion, body pain, and &lt;strong&gt;brain fog&lt;/strong&gt; ever since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative sets up a chain of events, then looks for cause.  The chain is “went for a hike” then “felt bad since”.  As we know, it is tempting to employ &lt;em&gt;post hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/em&gt; thinking here,  but is it correct to do so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several problems with this compelling and well-written narrative.  First is the tick bite that wasn’t.  In medicine, we don’t assume an event has happened unless there is evidence for it.  If you have clear evidence for a tick-borne disease but don’t remember a tick bite, then logic would dictate you simply had a bite but were unaware of it.  If you hang your diagnosis on a tick bite, but don’t recall the bite, then your reasoning is circular and nonsensical.  “I have Lyme disease because I had a tick bite, and I know I got bit because of have Lyme disease” is a problematic statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then is the misunderstanding of medical knowledge.  Doctors do not insist on the presence of the erythema migrans rash in order to diagnose Lyme disease.  It is a useful clue, but it’s presence is not required.  The writer’s terrible understanding of medicine and biology truly blossoms later in the story.  (By the way, “brain fog” is a common phrase in the literature of “alternative” diagnoses.  There is no consistent definition, and it is not clear what the phrase represents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, various doctors pinned assorted diagnoses on these symptoms, all of which promised exactly &lt;strong&gt;zero hope for a cure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t until a year ago this past week — nearly 24 years and a dozen or so doctors after my first collapse — that I finally got a firm diagnosis of Lyme disease. Last August, after returning home from the convention in Denver, I started the difficult and demanding high-dose multi-layered antibiotic treatment. &lt;strong&gt;The average case of chronic Lyme takes two to five years of treatment to cure&lt;/strong&gt;. At this late date, though, the odds are only about 70% that I’ll ever be able to shake it. Still, six months in, my joints work again. I can exercise and travel without having to pay it back with weeks in bed. And my mind grows sharper by the day. &lt;strong&gt;The drugs are working &lt;/strong&gt;– and every day I’m better is a day of grace I never thought I’d see.(&lt;em&gt;All emphasis mine. –PalMD&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting bits here.  First is the “zero hope for a cure.”  No one likes having there hope taken away. When we tell a patient that we don’t know what’s wrong with them this can be very unsettling.  Of course, even when we don’t have a precise diagnosis, we can still tell patients we will do everything we can to help them feel better. But some people want to hear an exact diagnosis and a clear plan for a cure—this isn’t always possible.  One approach to this uncertainty is to work closely with the patient to help ameliorate their symptoms.  Another is to lie to them.  I find the latter choice to be the easier one, but also the immoral and ultimately unhelpful choice.  Now, let’s see how quickly the writer can fail biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment takes so long because Lyme is the most cunningly persistent bacterium known to science. In its native state, it’s a spirochete — a cousin to syphilis. But if you hit it with penicillin, it will convert in a matter of minutes into an intracellular form that’s more like a mycoplasma, which will only respond to a macrolide antibiotic like azithromiycin or Biaxin. Or, just for fun, it will roll up into a hard cyst form that can hide, dormant, in the macrophages of cells, and then emerge to re-infect the host years on down the road. This well-armored third form responds — only very reluctantly — to Flagyl and a couple of the TB drugs. Curing the disease means taking large doses of several classes of antibiotics together for months at a time — either orally, or through an IV — so the germ will have nowhere to hide. And all the while, we also need to be carefully watching for and mitigating the drugs’ own very real consequences to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what it means that &lt;em&gt;Borrelia&lt;/em&gt; is “the most cunningly persistent bacterium known to science.”  I mean, I have opinions I suppose.  &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tb&lt;/em&gt; is a clever fellow, as is syphilis.  I’m not sure what makes &lt;em&gt;Borrelia&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; anything.  A micro-organism can be the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; prevalent, or the smallest or largest, but it can’t be the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; cunning.  “Persistent” is an interesting one.  I’m not sure what makes her think it’s particularly persistent.  Tuberculosis is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; persistent, as are many of the human herpes viruses.  As to the different supposed phases of the bacterium, it is not an obligate intracellular organism, and it is in fact not clear if it even can perisist within cells.  As far as antibiotic sensitivity, I am not aware that this changes, although some antibiotics are better at different stages of disease.  What is very clear from randomized controlled trials is that: 1) the somatic symptoms described by those with “chronic Lyme disease” are no more frequent in people who have had Lyme disease than in matched controls; 2) randomized controlled trials have failed to show any efficacy to prolonged antibiotic treatment in those who are described as having “chronic Lyme disease”.  The only source I could find that describes this particular “life cycle” of the spirochete is in the quack journal &lt;em&gt;Medical Hypotheses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, the ticks that deliver Lyme usually deliver other diseases, too: babesiosis (a form of malaria), ehrlichiosis, mycoplasma, and others that also must be found and treated for a full cure to happen. Though these are nominally “deer ticks,” entomologists have found Lyme-bearing ticks on birds, dogs, rodents, horses, and many other animals. &lt;a href="http://www.pitchengine.com/onthemarcmedia/chimp-attack-a-result-of-lyme-disease/5046/"&gt;Last week’s chimp attack&lt;/a&gt; is also being blamed on a form of Lyme psychosis. It’s probably true that veterinarians have a better handle on this disease than the doctors who treat humans do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh.  I don’t think she’s ever taken a biology course.  Babesiosis is not a form or malaria.  Also, I don’t doubt that veterinarians have a handle on animal diseases—I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; doubt that they have a better handle on human disease.  It’s just not their thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m loathe to continue the line-by-line analysis of the piece, as I don’t want to lose you here, so stick with me as I wrap this up.  The article continues the pattern of conclusion—&amp;gt;evidence.  Whatever the author may wish, we cannot do science by forming conclusions and then twisting the facts to fit these conclusions. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once some strains of Lyme get dispersed and embedded in the body’s tissues, the standard treatment won’t touch them. Worse: the standard Lyme tests won’t, either, so the results will likely come back negative. The shady politics of how the approved Lyme tests were developed would take a whole separate post to explain; but suffice to say that they’re only 70% accurate on their best day, which would make them patently unacceptable as a diagnostic tool were it any other disease. Far more accurate and sensitive tests are available, but insurance companies won’t cover the $400 fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These alternative Lyme tests are usually not covered because the are inaccurate.  The chronic Lyme advocates have sought out shaky labs that will give them the results that they desire, rather than the ones with most accurately reveal the biologic facts.  This leads directly into the Connecticut debacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/05/connecticut_attorney_general_p.php"&gt;the Connecticut attorney general actually harassed the Infectious Disease Society of America&lt;/a&gt; over their official treatment recommendations for Lyme disease.  In a classic, but strangely backward Pharma shill gambit, the ISDA was accused of being in cahoots with various forces to deny proper treatment to people with Lyme disease.  Part of the idiocy is that it is the chronic Lyme advocates who make millions administering expensive and disproved treatments.  The ISDA guidelines are both evidence based and cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular piece, posted on a popular blog, is a horrible piece of medical writing, but a perfect example of what can go wrong when a reporter doesn’t understand science.   The diagnosis and treatment of disease is supposed to be based on science, not on wish-fulfillment.  It’s difficult to have unexplained symptoms, but giving them a false label and subjecting oneself to fake treatments helps no one except the person receiving the check.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a short list of our contestants this week, a few of the obnoxious people who are lurking about in the comments right now. We're going to get rid of some of them, one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barb&lt;br&gt;
Alan Clarke&lt;br&gt;
Facilis&lt;br&gt;
John Kwok&lt;br&gt;
Pete Rooke&lt;br&gt;
RogerS&lt;br&gt;
Simon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets to vote them off the blog — just leave a comment with the name of the competitor you like least, and I&amp;#39;ll tally them up on Wednesday morning, and the winner gets evicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! There's more! We have to have an &lt;i&gt;immunity challenge&lt;/i&gt;, don't we? Our 7 intrepid dingleberries have an opportunity to save themselves by meeting an appropriate challenge by 1:00pm Central time tomorrow. After 1:00, I'll ask the readers here to vote on who best and adequately met the challenge (and you'll all be fair and honest about it, I hope), and that winner will be exempt from eviction this round. Sounds fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the challenge. In a comment that isn't longer than about 200 words, that is grammatically correct and logically coherent, and that does not cite the Bible or other religious authorities (and does not rely on tales about who you went to high school with, or tortured analogies involving necrophiliac pedophilic milkmen), explain how evolutionary biologists resolve the trivial conundrum represented by the common question, &lt;b&gt;"If evolution is true, why are there still monkeys?"&lt;/b&gt; Remember, answer as a biologist or intelligent layman would, not like Pat Robertson or Ken Ham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go! Voting will continue until Wednesday morning, our contestants have until 1:00pm Central on Tuesday to meet the immunity challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/survivor_pharyngula_day_one.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/KsOLcf1ro-k" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237228316701"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/death_is_not_an_option_where_t.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92195c27bd7751f1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><title type="html">Death is not an option: where to put the micro-manager from Hell.</title><published>2009-03-16T16:50:16Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T16:50:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/TPyJWDv0zlw/death_is_not_an_option_where_t.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/death_is_not_an_option_where_t.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm couching the question in terms of the academic milieu, but I suspect people in other types of organizations face a similar kind of choice. &lt;/p&gt;

He &lt;a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;amp;pageId=91655"&gt;dreamed that he was president&lt;/a&gt;. It would be our nightmare; after going on and on about the usual far right anti-tax tripe and militaristic fantasies, he gets to education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a man who intended to be a teacher myself, I issued an ultimatum to the teachers' unions: They would return to basic math, including arithmetic, and basic English (the mandated official language), and basic science &lt;i&gt;devoid of unproven theories like evolution&lt;/i&gt;, sticking instead to factual evidence and not discounting "intelligent design" as the more scientific basis for life and existence. All history books would again detail the reasons America was founded, and tell the stories of our Founding Fathers and national heroes - not latter day revisions. Teachers' pay and advancement would depend on the test scores and comprehension of their students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes. Delusional incompetence on display!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then he ends his goofy reminiscence of a trivial dream with this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I woke up tingling with excitement - only to find I'd been dreaming. But I can't get it out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;i&gt;dream&lt;/i&gt;, Pat. I know you loons have a tough time sorting out reality from fantasy, but it's nothing to be excited about.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coooool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/spitzer/multimedia/spitzer-20090316.html"&gt;This is NGC 6240&lt;/a&gt;, what used to be two galaxies but are in the process of becoming one. We see colliding galaxies all over the sky, but what makes this one special is the timing and its location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collisions take hundreds of millions of years, starting from the first tentative approach to the complete merging of the two. But the different steps of the process take different amounts of time. The initial approach takes a long time, for example, so we see lots of those. The actual physical merging also takes many millions of years, so we commonly see that as well. But while the outer parts of the galaxy are interacting, so are the cores. The time between the outer parts settling down and the inner parts doing their thing can be fairly short. NGC 6240 is right now at the moment in its life where the two galaxies have started to merge, but the cores of the two are still distinct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the farther away we look, the more volume of the Universe we see, so the more galaxies we see. In the distant Universe we do see galaxies in this stage, but they are so far away that details are unclear. NGC 6240 is only 400 million light years away, which is a ridiculously long way in human terms, but close enough in cosmic scales that Hubble and Spitzer can see those details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outer parts of the galaxy are still messy, churned up by the violence of the collision. Huge gas and dust clouds have collided, which triggers an immense burst of star formation. Newborn stars create a lot of dust — giant organic molecules that are very efficient at absorbing the visible light Hubble detects. However, warm dust emits infrared light, and Spitzer can see that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the Hubble image we see the stars and gas tossed all over the place, and the chaotic dust (in red) detected by Spitzer. Combined, the two images tell a tale of what a pair of galaxies is like just before their cores start to merge, a snapshot in an instant of a catastrophic event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… and in a few million years, the fireworks will &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; begin. All big galaxies have a supermassive black hole in their hearts, and the two bruisers in this pair will start to work their magic as well. The cores will combine, and the gravitational wake of the two black holes interacting will make the previous merging process seem like a gentle breeze. The gas and dust in the center of the merging monsters will become incredibly turbulent, mixed violently and suddenly, creating a vast wave of star formation. A huge amount of energy will blast out of the core, and get absorbed by the dust there. It will convert that high energy radiation into infrared, pouring out the invisible light, and NGC 6240 may become a ULIRG, an ultra luminous infrared galaxy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will pose no threat to us at its vast distance, but we’ll have a great view of this step in a galactic merger as well. Too bad we have to wait several million years for it. So for now we’ll just have to be satisfied with catching this merger in the act. There’s still plenty to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237224343814"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/monday_autism_news_potpourri_6">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5867080f00a804e7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Monday Autism News Potpourri</title><published>2009-03-16T17:23:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T17:23:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/monday_autism_news_potpourri_6" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/2/1598680_e98273af6d_m.jpg" alt="a bowl of potpourri from above" style="float:right;margin:10px"&gt;1.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2009/03/05/9406"&gt;The Uganda seminar&lt;/a&gt; featuring &lt;a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2009/02/24/9098"&gt;three American anti-gay activists&lt;/a&gt; is starting to attract international attention. The International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, along with Sexual Minorities Uganda, has issued a press release denouncing the appearance of &lt;a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/tag/scott-lively"&gt;Nazi revisionist and Watchmen On the Walls co-founder Scott Lively&lt;/a&gt;, Exodus International board member&lt;a href="http://exodus.to/content/view/31/115/"&gt; Don Schmierer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.gaytostraight.org/RefTherapists.asp"&gt;Caleb Lee Brundidge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2006/07/24/37"&gt;Richard Cohen’s&lt;/a&gt; International Healing Foundation at a conference to be held this weekend in Kampala.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_11921999"&gt;
This morning the San Jose Mercury News reports that "anti-gay hate crimes" have increased dramatically.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexual behavior is 
&lt;p&gt;
Hate crime cases involving anti-gay sentiment shot up in Santa Clara County last year, a striking increase that a leading prosecutor attributes to controversy over Proposition 8, the voter-approved ban on gay marriage.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Anti-gay incidents accounted for more than half of hate-crime cases last year — 56 percent — a big jump from only 15 percent in 2007. There were 14 anti-gay cases out of 25 hate-crime cases in 2008, compared with only 3 out of 20 in 2007.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"My belief from having done this work for many years is that surges in types of hate incidents are linked to the headlines and controversies of the day,'' said Deputy District Attorney Jay Boyarsky, who is assigned to monitor hate crimes. "Marriage equality and Proposition 8 have been in the news, and we have seen an increase in gay-bashing.''
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The Southern Poverty Law Center lists three groups in California as being specifically anti-gay hate groups:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Traditional Values Coalition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abiding Truth Ministries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chalcedon Foundation&lt;/li&gt;

Frustration ensues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to John McWhorter (in &lt;em&gt;Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue: The Untold History of English&lt;/em&gt; (2008)) on "singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;", a topic we've returned to many times on Language Log. The short version is that in certain (not all) contexts, singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; is entirely standard and has been so for a very long time. Yet many people believe, passionately, that it is always wrong, because it offends "logic".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McWhorter works up to this topic by way of two celebrated non-rules, proscribing sentence-final prepositions and proscribing split infinitives. And then (p. 66):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… the notion that this usage is &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; holds on so hard that even linguists have to submit to their publishers&amp;#39; copy editors&amp;#39; insistence on expunging it, which answers the question we often get as to why we do not use constructions like this in our own writing if we are so okay with them. My own books are full of resorts to &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt;, which I find sexist, occasional dutiful &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt;s, which strike me as injecting a stray note of PC irrelevance into what I am discussing, or &lt;em&gt;he or she&lt;/em&gt;, which I find clumsy and clinical–for the simple reason that I was required to knuckle under. At best I can wangle an exception and get in a singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; once or twice a book. (I must note that the copy editor for this book, upon reading this section, actually allowed me to use singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; throughout the book. Here's to &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; in awed gratitude!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; is a little joke, of course, but in fact it's a case where singular &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; is somewhat awkward (since John presumably knows the sex of the editor).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237219254634"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=5335">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d197e0d26e0e5ab9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="books" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="stock" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">What Do Socks and Stocks Have in Common?</title><published>2009-03-16T15:43:36Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T15:43:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/what-do-socks-and-stocks-have-in-common/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/what-do-socks-and-stocks-have-in-common/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/what-do-socks-and-stocks-have-in-common/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">When the stock market plummets, where does the value of your holdings actually go?

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;But… "incentivized"?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage&lt;/em&gt; (1994) says of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;amp;pg=PA534&amp;amp;vq=incentivize&amp;amp;dq=Merriam-webster%27s+dictionary+of+English+Usage&amp;amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;amp;cad=0"&gt;incentivize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that "This is perhaps the most recent of the infamous verbs that end in &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt;", noting that the members of a usage panel in 1985 "rejected it almost unanimously with varying degrees of disgust and horror".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why are coinages in &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; such an enduring source of disgust and horror?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, Jacques Barzun argued that &lt;em&gt;containerize&lt;/em&gt; was "unnecessary jargon", since the verb &lt;em&gt;box&lt;/em&gt; was already available. In 1976,  Edwin Newman objected strongly to&lt;em&gt; prioritize, personalize, traumatize,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;hospitalize&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;A Civil Tongue&lt;/em&gt;,  in a section entitled "Them there ize"). In 1870, Richard Grant White said that &lt;em&gt;jeopardize&lt;/em&gt; was &amp;quot;a foolish and intolerable word&amp;quot; — he recommended in its place the verb &lt;em&gt;jeopard&lt;/em&gt;. And skipping back over a few centuries of documented revulsion, we find the OED leading off its entry for &lt;em&gt;-ize &lt;/em&gt;with this citation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1591&lt;/strong&gt; NASHE &lt;em&gt;Introd. Sidney&amp;#39;s Astr. &amp;amp; Stella&lt;/em&gt; in P. Penilesse (Shaks. Soc.) p. xxx, Reprehenders, that complain of my boystrous compound wordes, and ending my Italionate coyned verbes all in ize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Q-MNAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;pg=RA1-PR8&amp;amp;vq=reprehenders&amp;amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;amp;cad=0"&gt;context of this phrase&lt;/a&gt; is amusing enough to quote at greater length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The ploddinger sort of unlearned Zoilists about London exclaim that it is a puft-up stile, and full of prophane eloquence: others object unto me the multitude of my boystrous compound wordes, and the often coyning of Italionate verbes, which end all in &lt;em&gt;ize&lt;/em&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;mummianize, tympanize, tirannize&lt;/em&gt;. To the first array of my clumperton antagonists this I answer — that my stile is no otherwise puft up, then any mans should be which writes with any spirite; and whom would not such a devine subject put a high ravishte spirite into? For the prophaneness of my eloquence, so they may terme the eloquence of Sainct Austin, Jerome, Chrysostome, prophane, since none of them but takes unto him faire more liberty of tropes, figures, and metaphors, and alleadging heathen examples and histories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;To the second rancke of reprehenders, that complain of my boystrous compound wordes, and ending my Italionate coyned verbes all in &lt;em&gt;ize&lt;/em&gt;, thus I reply: that no winde that blowes strong but is boystrous, no speech or wordes, or any power of force to confute or persuade, but must be swelling and boystrous. For the compounding of my wordes, therein I imitate rich men, who, having gathered store of white single money together, convert a number of those small little scutes into great peeces of gold, such as double pistols and Portugues. Our English tongue, of all languages, most swarmeth with the single money of monasillables, which are the onely scandal of it. Bookes written in them, and no other, seeme like shop-keepers boxes, that contain nothing else save halfe-pence, three farthings and two-pences. Therefore, what did me I, but having a huge heape of those worthlesse shreds of small English in my &lt;em&gt;pia mater&lt;/em&gt;'s purse, had them to the compounders immediately, and exchanged them foure into one, and others into more, according to the Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Come, my maisters, enure your mouths to it, and never trust me, but when you have tride the commodity of carrying much in a small roome, you will, like the apothecaries, use more compounds than simples, and graft wordes as men do their trees, to make them more fruitfull. My ubraided Italionate verbes are the least crime of a thousand, since they are growne in generall request with every good poet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Besides, they carrie farre more state with them then any other, and are not halfe so harsh in their desinence as the old hobling English verbes ending in r: they express more than any other verbes whatsoever, and that substantives would be quite barraine of verbs, but for that ending. This word &lt;em&gt;mummianized&lt;/em&gt;, in the beginning of my first Epistle, is shrewdly called into question, for no other reason, that I can conceive, but that his true derivative, which is &lt;em&gt;mummy&lt;/em&gt;, is somewhat obscure also: to phisitions and their confectioners it is as familiar as &lt;em&gt;mumchance&lt;/em&gt; among pages, being nothing else but mans flesh long buried and broyled in the burning sands of Arabia. Hereupon I have taken up this phrase of Jerusalems &lt;em&gt;mummianized&lt;/em&gt; earth manured with mans flesh. Express who can the same substance so briefly in any other word but that. A man may murder any thing if hee list in the mouthing, and grinde it to powder extempore betwixt a huge paire of jawes, but let a quest of calme censors goe upon it betwixt the houres of sixe and seaven in the morning, and they will, in their grave wisdome, subscribe to it as tollerable and significant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neologisms in &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; have been springing up in English like mushrooms for five hundred years. Some of them catch on, while others don&amp;#39;t — among the three that Nashe cites, &lt;em&gt;tyrannize&lt;/em&gt; is in common use today, while &lt;em&gt;tympanize&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mummianize&lt;/em&gt; are not. The general pattern seems to be that some people react very negatively to a certain class of &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; coinages, for a generation or so, and then those that have endured lose their taint. I doubt that David would react to &lt;em&gt;tyrannize&lt;/em&gt;, and probably not to &lt;em&gt;hospitalize&lt;/em&gt;. But for now, &lt;em&gt;incentivize&lt;/em&gt; is still stigmatized. (The efforts of Edwin Newman and others also probably have played a role in sensitizing people to certain coinages; also, I have the impression that words coined in business or advertising, like &lt;em&gt;incentivize&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;accessorize&lt;/em&gt;, are much more likely to annoy people, in contrast to words from science, like &lt;em&gt;randomize&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;pressurize&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting thing about the &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; stigma is that it seems to apply only to words based on common nouns (and in some cases, adjectives), not those derived from names. Thus as far as I know, there has never been any objection to &lt;em&gt;galvanize, mesmerize, bowdlerize, mercerize, chaptalize&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;vulcanize&lt;/em&gt;; or for that matter to &lt;em&gt;hellenize, romanize, americanize&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also apparently a special license for scientific words — thus &lt;em&gt;randomize&lt;/em&gt;, dating from 1926, and &lt;em&gt;pressurize&lt;/em&gt;, dating from 1940, never seems to have been a source of disgust and horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But otherwise, a strong initial revulsion to  &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; coinages based on common nouns has apparently been in effect for nearly half a millennium.  With respect to each particular coinage, the reaction eventually fades if the word sticks around.  Judging by &lt;em&gt;hospitalize&lt;/em&gt; (first spotted in 1901) and &lt;em&gt;traumatize&lt;/em&gt; (first spotted in 1903), which Edwin Newman railed against in 1976 but which seem to be generally accepted today, it can take up to a century for &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; coinages in the general vocabulary to make it out of quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm puzzled by the durability and specificity of this set of prescriptive reactions. Is it just a random development, like the attitudes about stranded  prepositions, with each generation inheriting from its parents what was originally a completely gratuitous prejudice?  Or is there a genuine source of cultural tension in the morpheme &lt;em&gt;-ize&lt;/em&gt; and the way it's used to form (some) new words?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237217210396"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/shermer_at_the_creation_museum.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/005a541ea300ef1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Shermer at the Creation Museum</title><published>2009-03-16T15:27:13Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T15:27:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/PTte91aqHrw/shermer_at_the_creation_museum.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/shermer_at_the_creation_museum.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Feel in need of a purgative? Watch this video of Michael Shermer interviewing a creation "scientist" at the Creation Museum. I could only make it halfway through before closing it in disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/a_CLIGJW6Ic%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh. Georgia Purdom is a blind weasel: for example, she berates Christian evolutionists for "interpreting" the bible instead of reading it literally, and then says, &lt;span&gt;"We know from scripture that the earth is no more than 6000 years old:&lt;/span&gt;. The bible says nothing of the kind. That is a product of peculiar interpretations of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when Shermer presses her on what kinds of experiments she would do to test her assertions, she says, &lt;span&gt;"We wouldn't do that because we know there's no point in doing that, because the Bible has the answer."&lt;/span&gt; There's no science there; that's a plain admission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/shermer_at_the_creation_museum.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/PTte91aqHrw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237215895834"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=5257">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6138055193f52dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="twitter" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">@Twitter</title><published>2009-03-16T14:54:24Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T14:54:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/twitter/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/twitter/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/twitter/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">| We tweet!

There are only Christianities, local ones, which operate in local settings. Need I remind you how many branches there are around the world? &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I've said, I left my faith behind when I could no longer believe the Bible. It was a process that began with the recognition that the stories in Genesis 1-11 were nothing more nor less than mythic folktales. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My faith was an evangelical Christian faith, one that believes what the Bible says. So when I could no longer believe the Bible I could no longer believe. It was that simple to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The interesting thing about this is that liberal and Catholic Christians will hear my story and pretty much scoff at me, since their faith is not based upon the historical accuracy of the Bible. I find that strange, very strange. But they don't. They claim that if I started out with the correct faith to begin with I wouldn't have left the fold later when my faith in the Bible was shattered. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is an interesting argument, one I completely reject, since I don't understand why I should believe the community of believers when the stories they preach are not founded on the historical truth. But I raise the issue here.&lt;strong&gt; Is the relationship of the Bible to the Christian faith, indispensable?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an atheist I'm not in the business of settling "in-house" arguments between Christians, and this is one of those type of arguments, one of many. Although, I do think the conservatives have this right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-7668661443530079219?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of museum silliness with thanks to Dear Reader Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, my dear &lt;a href="http://www.historiska.se/"&gt;Museum of National Antiquities&lt;/a&gt; has not escaped the weird influence of post-modernist museology. In its excellent on-line catalogue, which I cannot recommend highly enough, we find &lt;a href="http://mis.historiska.se/mis/sok/fid.asp?fid=570651"&gt;object number -100:559&lt;/a&gt;: an ice cream stick, dating from the '00s. Its context is unusually unclear in the on-line info, but it appears to have been donated during an outreach project where kids were invited to give the museum stuff and speculate about how people in the future will one day interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think curating, photographing and cataloguing things like this is a good use of public funds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And Fredrik, please don't bother writing an angry comment this time. Maybe you should start a blog instead.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 17 March:&lt;/b&gt; And here's a &lt;a href="http://mis.historiska.se/mis/sok/fid.asp?fid=570645"&gt;bus time table&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://mis.historiska.se/mis/sok/fid.asp?fid=570646"&gt;plastic water bottle&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://mis.historiska.se/mis/sok/fid.asp?fid=570648"&gt;dud lottery ticket&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://mis.historiska.se/mis/sok/fid.asp?fid=570634"&gt;drinking straw&lt;/a&gt; and a crumpled &lt;a href="http://mis.historiska.se/mis/sok/fid.asp?fid=570606"&gt;shop receipt&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;As digital repository librarian at the UW-Madison Library, all Dorothea Salo's computer knowledge is self-taught, leading to a "rough and ready" approach to making things work. Steve Lawson, humanities librarian, Colorado College, Colorado Springs, says that Salo's "exhortation to just 'beat things with rocks until they work' has been a source of much inspiration for me."

&lt;p&gt;That same relentlessness extends to Salo's pet cause, open access. "Dorothea is the Cassandra of open access," says Laura Crossett, branch manager, Park County Library System, Meeteetse, WY, "the one speaking powerful, critical truths that most people would rather not hear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example Salo's seminal and widely cited fall 2008 article for Library Trends, "Innkeeper at the Roach Motel" (roachmotel.notlong.com). "I became the 'Innkeeper at the Roach Motel,'" explains Salo, "when I used the phrase roach motel to explain to a faculty member that the repository didn't have document versioning; documents went in, but they didn't come out to be reworked." The article builds on topics Salo often visits at her blog, Caveat Lector ("let the reader beware"), where she's similarly become known for pulling no punches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Open access starts at home," says Salo, who sees the profession as "disastrously timid about supporting experimentation and the business models we think preferable, speaking truth to power, even just modeling the behaviors we want faculty to adopt." Issuing a call to arms, she warns, "We can't just wring our hands about the serials crisis any longer. If we want results, we need to put our market power and our praxis where our mouth is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/cassandra_of_open_access.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Y_5CGHkhmbw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237206134664"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_625.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/385469a80440b224</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">My picks from ScienceDaily</title><published>2009-03-16T12:40:31Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T12:40:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/knGxevWin90/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_625.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_625.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_625.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/my_picks_from_sciencedaily_625.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/knGxevWin90" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237205503568"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=496">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/679631d4e1f9ad30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Hyperbaric Oxygen for Autism</title><published>2009-03-16T12:00:35Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T12:00:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=496" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/9/21/abstract"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt; looks at the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in autism. The study is the first double-blind placebo controlled study of such therapy in autism and found a significant improvement in those children in the treatment group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the treatment is very controversial and remains so, even after this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves placing patients in a chamber with pressure increased above atmospheric pressure with an enriched oxygen content.  It has many legitimate medical applications, such as treating certain kinds of infection, but also has become popular among some as an unscientific treatment. It is offered by practitioners and chambers are even sometimes purchased by private individuals for their own family’s use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that some claims for hyperbaric oxygen go way past the evidence, or exist in the utter absence of evidence. This includes autism - there are no compelling studies showing any benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy in autism. The few studies that do exist are uncontrolled, which means they are mostly worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This current study is at least a double-blind controlled trial. But it still has significant weaknesses. The primary weakness, in my opinion, is that the parents of the children being studied were allowed in the chamber with their children. The two groups in the study either received 24% oxygen in 1.3 atmospheres, or 21% oxygen in 1.03 atmospheres. It’s probable that many of the parents knew if they were getting increased pressure or not, and this therefore could have unblinded the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tight blinding is critical for these type of studies because the assessment of the effect on the autistic children is highly subjective. For example, the assessment includes how much eye contact the children make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is also on the small side, with 62 children total. However, the clinical effects were very robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have pointed out that the study leader, Daniel Rossignol, has a potential conflict of interest in that he offers hyperbaric oxygen therapy in his practice. He therefore stands to gain personally if its effectiveness is proven. While such conflicts are important to expose, I think they are trumped by a well-enough controlled study. The whole point of a well-designed study is to eliminate the effects of bias. But given that this study was poorly blinded, and bias was present, it certainly diminishes its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees, even Rossignol, that this study will not end the controversy over hyperbaric oxygen in autism. It needs to be replicated. This is generically true of any new treatment - the first few smallish studies are never enough to establish its effectiveness. The strength of clinical trials rests primarily in replication. Only when various researchers with different biases come to the same conclusion from well-designed studies can we confidently come to a conclusion. The history of medicine is littered with treatments that initially seemed promising but just did not pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another weakness of the study is that it was short term, only four weeks. It therefore did not test if the effect of hyperbaric treatment survives much beyond the treatment itself. Even if the effect in this study is real, it may represent only a temporary symptomatic benefit - not altering the course of autism itself. Therefore longer followup studies are needed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not impossible that hyperbaric oxygen may have some benefit in some children with autism. Although there is no established mechanism at this time, and proposed mechanisms (like the notion that hyperbaric O2 decreases inflammation) are largely speculative. But a physiological effect is not implausible. The treatment is also fairly safe. Therefore it is reasonable to study it further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest risk of the treatment now is that it is expensive - costing 150-900 dollars per treatment or 14-17 thousand dollars for a chamber. It also diverts energy and emotions away from possibly more productive treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, this is one treatment where I think high quality research may have an actual impact. If it works, of course, than more people can benefit from it. If high quality studies show it does not work I think there are families who will save themselves from the expense of an ineffective treatment. It will likely not go away completely, but would be significantly marginalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing is clear - any future studies should be very tightly controlled, or they will be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;

Author: James McWilliams&lt;br&gt;
Bug Rating:&lt;img title="cicada3.png" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/cicada3.png?w=119&amp;amp;h=25" alt="cicada3.png" width="119" height="25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a VERY long time reading, and then re-reading this book. I really struggled with it, because some very unflattering things were said about entomologists that I learned to revere as pioneers in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did my reaction to the book come from the exposure of the smelly clay feet of my fore-entomologists? Or was it the actual content of the book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I concluded it was both. Some of the reason I wasn’t keen on the book initially, despite my love of things historical and entomological, was that some early entomologists are portrayed in a less than flattering light. Of course, it’s hardly news that many early entomologists weren’t perfect, so I kept reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what is said in this book is very true, and insightful. Probably the key thing to take from it is the concept of “&lt;strong&gt;path dependence&lt;/strong&gt;“–that early decisions about the ways in which agriculture was pursued in the US created a path that made certain other decisions (monoculture and increased use of pesticides, for example) inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the book is this:&lt;br&gt;
If you argue that certain early decisions (monoculture, clearing the prairie, etc.) make later choices and decisions &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;inevitable&lt;/span&gt;, casting entomologists as villains working for “politically corrupt” regulatory agencies or greedy corporations becomes problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author presents early individual experimentation by local farmers as the best way for sustainable insect control–yet also acknowledges that only a formal, concerted effort at the federal level can deal with many pests, and that lack of that formal control led to failures in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book seems to contradict itself in this way consistently, at the same time that it is a valuable account of the development of early entomology in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of early insect control is one that should make anyone’s hair stand on end. Here’s just a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; list of things used on food crops to control insects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Whale oil soap * Carbolic Acid  *  Arsenic (Paris green)  *  HCL gas * Kerosene   * Lead   * Lime (London Purple)  *  Copper Sulfate * Sulfur  *  Coal oil  *  Acetoarsenic   *  Cyanide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author does an excellent job of describing the historic spread of several devastating insect pests–Colorado potato beetle, San Jose Scale, and plum curculio, among others–and how the development of trains and other transport systems helped move pests around, exacerbating control problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McWilliams traces the way in which early Americans tried to control their environment at the same time they pursued economic goals that led them to undermine their ability to ever achieve that control.  They cleared land, stopped growing a mix of crops in favor of monoculture, and introduced species.  Americans fundamentally altered the dynamics of insect populations with their landscape changes–and thus, strategies of insect control also had to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McWilliams seems to wants to promote biocontrol and local production as alternatives for our modern chemical lifestyle, but he has trouble reconciling his romanticism of early farmers with the later hard choices they (and early entomologists) were forced into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few entomologists come off particularly badly in the book.  L.O. Howard practically seems like he should be twirling a villain’s moustache. He is described as having a “revisionist agenda”:   &lt;em&gt;“The mosquito… revealed Howard’s ingenious ability to strategically and temporarily focus the Bureau of Entomology from agriculture to public health, a reorientation that favored chemical insecticides.” p.119&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was during Howard’s lifetime that the mystery of insects as disease vectors for some horrific diseases known was revealed. Changing focus to public health was therefore a fairly logical switch.   It was also during his tenure that entomologists became part of the military in WWI. The urgency of war meant that most efficient, fastest methods had to be used:  insecticides.  Cultural/biological controls took too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was Howard a wanker? Sure. But that doesn’t mean he was also part of a sinister chemical plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapters covering the rise of chemical insecticides and chemical companies, McWilliams provides the most unsatisfactory coverage. For example, on p. 156:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“As objections to the use of insecticides became more strident, a well-oiled publicity machine lurched into motion to counteract the post-”poison apple scare” denunciations of chemical dependence.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who’s machine, exactly? It’s unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial Food, Drug, Cosmetic act of 1938 contained a fatal flaw.  It allowed FDA to establish “safe” levels of insecticide residue, and to seize/destroy tainted crops. However, did NOT give them ability to investigate links between health and insecticides.  From this problematic beginning, it was easy for chemical companies to run amok.  However, eventually, that changed, in part thanks to the heroic work of Rachel Carson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the later sections of this book have a hurried quality that isn’t the same as the earlier chapters. It’s marked by secondary sources, unlike some of the lovely materials from Colonial farmers that are quoted extensively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his epilogue chapter, McWilliams makes this startling observation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“the expense of winning approval from regulatory agencies (no matter how politically corrupt) are generally welcome developments in the insect wars.”   p. 221. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um. Corrupt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a hugely sweeping statement. And while I will certainly not deny that the Bush Administration tampered mightily with science, the vast majority of federal entomologists and other scientists would not consider themselves corrupt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, further undermining his credibility, McWilliams repeats the false information that early mosquito expert Dyar named an insect &lt;em&gt;corpulentis&lt;/em&gt; after Smith, an early mosquito bio-control person, and that Smith named his next species &lt;em&gt;dyaria&lt;/em&gt;. (p. 127). &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/insects-bigamy-and-history/"&gt;That is a false story, which I have covered here.&lt;/a&gt; It also points to the problem of using secondary sources, which I would not expect from a historian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary:  Very interesting work on farming and entomology pre-1920s; after that, unsatisfactory,  incompletely sourced, and not internally consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

Australians are my kinda folks: loud, blunt, funny, and they have those silly accents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect that shocked me, though, was how popular homeopathy is there. We went into a pharmacy so I could get decongestants (this entire planet irritates my sinuses), and the homeopathic garbage was everywhere. &lt;a href="http://www.mysteryinvestigators.com/"&gt;Richard Saunders&lt;/a&gt;, my host (and arguably Oz’s most famous skeptic), told me that the homeopaths spend a lot of money to get their stuff into pharmacies there, including paying for attractive displays to make their diluted water more eye-catching. There was &lt;em&gt;an entire wall&lt;/em&gt; devoted to homeopathic placebos in one place we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard and &lt;a href="http://skeptics.com.au/"&gt;the Australian Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; have taken it on themselves to fight this sort of flim-flam. &lt;a href="http://skeptics.com.au/media/0903pharmacists.pdf"&gt;They created a one-page PDF ad&lt;/a&gt; taking the pharmacies to task for it. Richard created &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3354220205/"&gt;a JPG version&lt;/a&gt; which I uploaded to my Flickr page as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rosenblumtv.com/?p=2942" title=""&gt;Michael Rosenblum&lt;/a&gt; appears to feel the same way about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two years ago, we began a very interesting experiment with a major cable provider.

&lt;p&gt;We built and ran (and continue to run) a hyper-local TV station which is probably the most cost-effective in the country. It's a model for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, after two years, we are going to start our second one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we sat down to do the budgets, the first thing we cut out was the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an office for the first station, but realized after a year, no one went there. There was no need for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our video journalists work from the field, cut on their own laptops, and set their own schedules. Coming into an office every day would only eat into their reporting time and serve no purpose. Not to mention the vast cost of a physical office - the building, the desks, the carpet, the lights.  All unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we set out to design our second station, we eliminated the building and the office entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I raised this concept recently at a media conference held at CUNY in New York, chaired by Jeff Jarvis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many journalists on my panel were upset at the concept.  "You need a newsroom" they opined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I don't think you do....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he goes on about NBC having an unnecessary (and expensive) building and Facebook not having one and &lt;a href="http://blog.k1v1n.com/2009/03/waste-in-administering-science.html" title=""&gt;Kevin Gamble&lt;/a&gt; adds that perhaps NSF does not need a building any more as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought there actually was a Facebook building in Palo Alto, is there? Perhaps just an office within a building. But when Robert Scoble visits Facebook and blogs about it, I don't think he has a beer with the guys at a bar - he visits a discrete space, something with floors and doors and furniture. Otherwise, I support the sentiment 100%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/no_you_dont_need_a_physical_ne.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/41ZlsvvEbiE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237201429115"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/global_warming_is_the_science.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d5424ba3d509bf60</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Earth"/><title type="html">Global Warming: Is the Science Settled Enough for Policy?</title><published>2009-03-16T10:02:31Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T10:02:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/t88YXHlm4YA/global_warming_is_the_science.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/global_warming_is_the_science.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/WXaruC4vJCU%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26color1%3D0x234900%26color2%3D0x4e9e00%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=445&amp;amp;height=364" width="445" height="364"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;July 24, 2008 presentation by Stephen Schneider for the Stanford University Office of Science Outreach's Summer Science Lecture Series.

&lt;p&gt;Professor Schneider discusses the local, regional, and international actions that are already beginning to address global warming and describe other actions that could be taken, if there were political will to substantially reduce the magnitude of the risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) From &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/jr/052705a.html"&gt;Swift,&lt;/a&gt; May 27th, 2005. James Randi’s blog on the &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/"&gt;JREF.&lt;/a&gt; The following is an excerpt from an explanation of how Lifewave patches work.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“..More specifically what happens is that the human magnetic field passes through the patches, and this field causes the organic array inside of the patches to begin to vibrate (like an antenna). This is how the resonant energy transfer affects the frequency modulation in the human energy field”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pardon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to update this post as I find more nuggets on the internet. I assure you readers, this will be fun and just a little bit scary…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: if you come across some Lifewave gold, email or message me. I’ll happily add it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you recall, about a month ago British reporter &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com"&gt;Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt; published an exposé, a &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/solved/solved.htm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tour de force&lt;/em&gt; of investigative journalism&lt;/a&gt; that led him to discover that Andre Wakefield had not only had incredibly blatant &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;undisclosed conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt; (his having been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/surprise_surprise_andrew_wakefield_was_p.php"&gt;in the pocket of trial lawyers&lt;/a&gt; suing vaccine manufacturers and his forgetting to mention the little fact that he had been developing a competing version of a measles vaccine that he had been hoping to market) when he published his infamous 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper linking MMR to regressive autism and enterocolitis, but that he had in fact committed &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php"&gt;scientific fraud and falsified data&lt;/a&gt;. Although it took longer than I thought, the counterattack was forthcoming, first with David Kirby playing &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/keith_olbermann_played_for_a_fool.php"&gt;Keith Olbermann for a fool&lt;/a&gt; by using Olbermann's hatred for Rupert Murdoch to convince him that somehow Brian Deer had an undisclosed and irreconcilable conflict of interest. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/brian_deer_responds_to_keith_olbermann.php"&gt;He did not&lt;/a&gt;. Next up was the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/we_support_dr_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;We Support Dr. Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;" petition, which was as blatant of example of cultish behavior as I've ever seen. Most recently, the counterattack involved some seriously burning stupid laid down by that tag-team of antivaccine propaganda, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, twisting and distorting an old Vaccine Court case to make it sound as though the U.S. Government had conceded that MMR can cause autism. So what's left?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, a different tag-team attacking Brian Deer, of course! Behold, David Kirby serving once again in his role as Andrew Wakefield's mouthpiece in both the antivaccine crank blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/uk-autism-doctor-launches-formal-complaint-against-london-sunday-times-reporter.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt; and that repository of antivaccine pseudoscience &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/uk-autism-doctor-launches_b_174711.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; by trumpeting Wakefield's "&lt;a href="http://www.thoughtfulhouse.org/pr/complaint-against-brian-deer.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt;" to the UK's Press Complaints Commission (PCC) about Brian Deer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely have I seen two pieces of writing so utterly toxic and destructive to my irony meter.

The JREF is quite an amazing organization in many ways - including, of course, that the organization's founder is, in fact, Amazing. One of the ways you may not have experienced, though, is the sense of close-knit fellowship found onboard the JREF hosted cruises, called The Amaz!ng Adventures. The Amaz!ng Adventures are different from &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;The Amaz!ng Meeting&lt;/a&gt; in that the group is so much smaller, so much closer, and you never have an incident where you didn't actually say anything beyond "Hello" to someone you swore you'd hang out with (Sorry again, Loon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/amazing-meeting/215.html"&gt;Chasing El Chupacabra&lt;/a&gt; was the fourth cruise of the skeptical variety, and featured talks on the psychic industry, Mexican UFOs, and El Chupacabra (the Mexican goatsucker, who we were apparently chasing - though why anyone would actively follow a coyote with mange is a tad beyond me).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237195303325"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/culture-war-pharmacists-as-moral-arbiters-2009-edition.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/21aeee9bac3c3aef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cultural Criticism"/><title type="html">Culture War: Pharmacists as Moral Arbiters -- 2009 edition</title><published>2009-03-16T08:34:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T08:34:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/culture-war-pharmacists-as-moral-arbiters-2009-edition.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote about pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2005/12/culture_war_pha.html"&gt;back in 2005&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2007/03/terra_sigillata.html"&gt;again in 2007&lt;/a&gt;.  In 2005, The Head Nurse wrote &lt;a href="http://head-nurse.blogspot.com/2005/12/psa-of-sorts.html"&gt;What To Do If A Pharmacist Refuses to Fill a Prescription&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, it was about pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions having to do with sexuality (birth control, emergency birth control, and a medication that controls genital herpes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time it is a pharmacist refusing to fill a prescription for pain control medications. The story starts at Terra Sigillata, with  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/03/up_from_the_comments_pharmacis.php"&gt;Pharmacist objection to legitimate MS Contin prescription&lt;/a&gt;.  The short story:  A woman who has terminal cancer has a valid prescription for an opiate medication, MS Contin.  The pharmacy at Walgreen&amp;#39;s refuses to fill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/03/up_from_the_comments_pharmacis.php"&gt;Abel Pharmboy asks:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So we have a cancer patient in pain, in a rural area, unable to obtain opioid analgesics.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am very sensitive to the fatigue of my pharmacist and physician colleagues with all the tricks used by professional narc seekers. This attorney does not seem to be one of them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Should this pharmacist have had the right to refuse the prescription?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

How do you in practice differentiate between legitimate narcotic use and illicit seekers whose pills keep falling down the toilet?

leigh at the path forward is a &lt;a href="http://lalaleigha.wordpress.com/about/"&gt;graduate student in pharmacology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lalaleigha.wordpress.com/2009/03/14/opiates-and-pain/"&gt;wrote about opiates and pain control:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;i’m highly irritated with this supposed moral position that opiates should not be used in pain treatment. (really- where the hell does this opinion even come from?! that’s what opiates DO!) i think people shouldn’t inflict their lack of knowledge upon others. i’m going to talk a little bit (looking back, i talk about more than just a little bit!) about opiates and how they work in pain transmission mechanisms, so that my readers will be educated if they should ever happen upon such an ignorant assertion based upon no facts and only personal judgment. opiates are very well known effective pain-modulating agents. their known issues with tolerance, dependence, and possible addiction, and their fairly easy availablility on the street give them a general bad name. this can be deserved or not, depending on the application.

I am writing a substantive law review article on these issues; legal, moral, ethical, and medical. I truly believe we need a new epistemology regarding the roles of the professionals and opioids.

However, it goes beyond that in that we here at SBM believe that science- and evidence-based medicine is the best medicine. It’s more than the best medicine, though; it’s the best strategy for medicine to improve therapy for our patients. We frequently contrast science-based medicine with various forms of “complementary and alternative medicine,” specifically pointing out that SBM changes its practices as new science and new evidence mandates it while CAM tends to rely on ancient, &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/vitalism.html"&gt;vitalistic&lt;/a&gt;, pre-scientific or pre-modern scientific beliefs about how disease occurs as the basis for its therapies. Although it may be painfully slow and frustrating at times and even though there may be major stumbles along the way, the overall course of SBM over the last century has in general been to produce ever more effective therapies and to discard therapies that are either ineffective or whose risk-benefit ratios are insufficiently favorable. The one single most important thing behind the advancement of medicine is good science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why I really, really hate scientific fraud, and I’m really, really upset, perhaps even more so than &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=406"&gt;Dr. Atwood&lt;/a&gt;, over the discovery last week of what is arguably one of the most massive scientific frauds in medical history. It doesn’t matter that Dr. Atwood is an anaesthesiologist and I am not, meaning that the specific scientific fraud unearthed, which was perpetrated by an anesthesiologist studying multimodal anesthesia, as reported in &lt;a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?ses=ogst&amp;amp;section_id=3&amp;amp;show=dept&amp;amp;article_id=12634"&gt;Anesthesiology News&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123672510903888207.html"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/health/research/11pain.html?_r=1"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. I am a surgeon, and the relief of surgical pain in my patients is an important part of my practice. If the scientific basis of what my colleagues in anesthesiology do before, during, and after my operations is called into doubt, I have to wonder if I am giving my patients the best surgical care. Aside from that, there is the intellectual outrage I feel as a result of seeing science and patients betrayed in such a systematic and blatant manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for this sense of betrayal is that science as it is practiced today (and, in fact, as it has always been practiced) relies on a fair measure of trust. One part of the reason that science relies on a certain degree of trust is that the culture of science values openness, hypothesis testing, and vigorous debate. The general assumption is that most scientists are honest. Another part of the reason is that it is not possible for other scientists and peer reviewers to oversee the experiments and data collection of other scientists. There has to be some level of trust that scientists reporting their results aren’t making data up out of whole cloth. It’s true that we as scientists know that our colleagues (and, indeed ourselves) usually do try to present our data in the most favorable light possible in order to support our hypotheses, but we also know that we’d better find the mistakes and weaknesses in our experimental design and data analysis before we publish, because if we do not very likely our colleagues will, especially if we are working in a “hot” area where there is a lot of competition. Of course, we are also all human, and none of us is immune to the temptation to leave out our manuscripts and manuscripts that inconvenient bit of data that doesn’t fit with our hypothesis or to cherry pick the absolutely best-looking blots or graphs for use in our grant applications or scientific manuscripts. However, scientists also value their reputation among other scientists, and there’s no quicker way to seriously damage one’s reputation than to engage in dodgy behavior with data, and there’s no quicker way to destroy it utterly than to make up data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, opposing these forces favoring openness and honesty are the need to “publish or perish” in order to remain funded, to advance academically, and to become tenured, a pressure that can be particularly intense among basic scientists, who will fail to win tenure, lose their jobs, and very likely risk ending their academic careers if they cannot support their labs and support 50% or more of their salaries through grants. As an academic surgeon who has been fantastically fortunate enough to have landed two jobs where I spend at least as much time doing research as I do taking care of patients, I always remember that I’m in a much better position because, even if I failed utterly to renew all my grants and managed to burn through all my startup funds and whatever bridge funds my university provides, I’d be unlikely to be fired, as I could just go back to operating full time. True, it would be a huge career setback (although I would not be the first surgeon that this happened to; many give up trying to do both research and surgery because it is so hard). On the other hand, I’d even be likely to generate more income for my department by doing surgery than I could through research. Clinician-scientists are in general a drag on the finances of an academic department, their salaries and expenses partially subsidized by the clinical income of the high-producing surgeons in the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get to the &lt;a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?ses=ogst&amp;amp;section_id=3&amp;amp;show=dept&amp;amp;article_id=12634"&gt;specifics of the fraud in question&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what experts are calling one of the largest known cases of academic misconduct, a leading anesthesiology researcher has been accused of falsifying data and other fraud in potentially dozens of published studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott S. Reuben, MD, of Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., a pioneer in the area of multimodal analgesia, is said to have fabricated his results in at least 21, and perhaps many more, articles dating back to 1996. The confirmed articles were published in &lt;em&gt;Anesthesiology&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Anesthesia and Analgesia&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Anesthesia&lt;/em&gt; and other titles, which have retracted the papers or will soon do so, according to people familiar with the scandal (see list). The journals stressed that Dr. Reuben’s co-authors on those papers have not been accused of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to allegedly falsifying data, Dr. Reuben seems to have committed publishing forgery. Evan Ekman, MD, an orthopedic surgeon in Columbia, S.C., said his name appeared as a co-author on at least two of the retracted papers, despite his having had no hand in the manuscripts. “My names were forgeries on the documents,” Dr. Ekman told Anesthesiology News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reuben has been an extremely active and visible figure in multimodal analgesia, particularly as an advocate for its use in minimally invasive orthopedic and spine procedures. His research has provided support for several mainstays of current anesthetic practice, such as the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and neuropathic agents instead of opioids and preemptive analgesia. Dr. Reuben has also published and presented data suggesting that multimodal analgesia can significantly improve long-term outcomes for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to overstate how serious this revelation of scientific fraud is for the field of anesthesiology and medicine. Dr. Reuben was considered a pioneer in his field, and his work is not only widely cited, but serves as the basis for an amount of anesthesia practice that few academic anesthesiologists can lay claim to. Perhaps I would be best served to quote &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=406"&gt;Dr. Atwood&lt;/a&gt;, who as an anesthesiologist understands better than I just how influential Dr. Reuben was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case hit home in a couple of ways. Although SBM readers may think of me as one of the 10 or so most knowledgeable skeptics of pseudomedicine in the entire world, in my day job I am a practicing anesthesiologist in Massachusetts. A big problem in anesthesia and surgery is how to provide adequate pain relief for patients after especially painful operations, without having to use such high doses of narcotics that many, particularly the elderly, will become somnolent and have depressed respiratory drives. The issue thus involves both comfort and safety. Multimodal regimens such as those reported by Reuben seemed to offer one solution, and have become increasingly popular over the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the twenty-one papers now retracted represent a body of work that appeared on its surface to be quite impressive. Even knowing about the fraud, I find it impressive in another way–namely how Dr. Reuben could have maintained this fiction for so long, but more on that later.) In addition to Dr. Atwood’s, these &lt;a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?ses=ogst&amp;amp;section_id=3&amp;amp;show=dept&amp;amp;article_id=12634"&gt;two quotes&lt;/a&gt; will also give you an idea of just how influential Dr. Reuben was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of that is now in question, said Steven L. Shafer, MD, editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;Anesthesia and Analgesia&lt;/em&gt;, which retracted 10 of Dr. Reuben’s articles. “We are left with a large hole in our understanding of this field. There are substantial tendrils from this body of work that reach throughout the discipline of postoperative pain management,” Dr. Shafer said. “Those tendrils mean that almost every aspect will need to be carefully thought through. What do we still believe to be true? Do the conclusions hold up to scrutiny?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shafer said that although he still believes “philosophically” in multimodal analgesia, he can no longer be absolutely certain of its benefits without confirmation from future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shafer brings up another point, namely that multimodal anesthesia might actually be highly beneficial. After all, Dr. Reuben wasn’t the only researcher working on the topic. However, he was probably the preeminent voice advocating this form of anesthesia, which means that the entire scientific and evidentiary basis of multimodal anesthesia has now been called into question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacques Chelly, MD, PhD, MBA, director of the Division of Regional Anesthesia and Acute Interventional Perioperative Pain at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), said that the Reuben episode has left multimodal analgesia “in shambles concerning many of the drugs we use”–particularly celecoxib and pregabalin. “The big chunk of what people have based their protocol on is gone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that, even though it’s possible that multimodal anesthesia and analgesia might still be an effective modality, there is now considerable doubt about it. Dr. Reuben through his fraud has not only betrayed science, but betrayed his patients as well in one or both of the following two ways. If, for example, multimodal analgesia is no more effective than other methods, then his body of work based on falsified data over well over a decade has betrayed patients with pain, both chronic and acute, by persuading anesthesiologists to use a methodology that is no more effective than others and may be more risky. If, on the other hand, multimodal analgesia is indeed effective and Dr. Reuben just happened to “show” it by falsfying his data, then he has betrayed future patients, who now may not get the benefit of effective multimodal analgesia as anesthesiologists try to work out whether this modality works or not. Either way, it’s not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reuben’ scientific fraud is also highly unusual in another way. Usually, fraud involves a single paper or, at most, a handful of papers. Even &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=370"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, as far as can be discerned, only &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;fabricated data for one paper&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of Wakefield’s results derived from his utter incompetence as a scientist, which led to his unwillingness to worry about little things such as controls for his PCR or keeping stock plasmids (whose presence can result in false positives given just how sensitive PCR is) separate from samples being tested. Dr. Reuben’s fraud appears to eclipse even that of Andrew Wakefield, as hard as that is to believe. Indeed, I’ve never seen an example involving such a massive body of work so important to a field over so many years. It’s truly staggering. A PubMed search shows that Dr. Reuben has over 70 peer-reviewed papers. It’s hard not to wonder how many of his other publications are also based on fraudulent data, and, even if they aren’t fraudulent, Reuben’s other work will be forever tainted by them, regardless of whether the science was good or not. It’s not for nothing that Dr. Reuben has been likened to &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2082741"&gt;Jason Blair&lt;/a&gt; in journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see an example of fraud like this, I wonder: How could Dr. Reuben get away with, in essence, “making it up” for so long? If he were a lone scientist working alone in a laboratory, I could see how he might be clever enough to pull it off. However, these days science, and in particular biomedical science, is a highly collaborative endeavor. Gone are the days of single labs working on problems. These days, such publications, with one or a handful of authors, are increasingly rare, and if they’re rare for basic science they are virtually unheard of in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that clinical trials have become very complex. Many people are involved, from the clinical trials office, the scientific review board, the institutional review board, and all the clinicians who enroll patients on clinical trials. Also, they inevitably involve statisticians who analyze the data. Most clinical science journals these days will not even consider publishing the results of a clinical trial without a biostatistician listed among the authors, and the higher profile clinical journals include biostatisticians as peer reviewers for any manuscript reporting the results of a clinical trial. Then there is the question of all the other authors on Dr. Reuben’s papers. (As mentioned before, at least one of his co-authors over the years were included on the author list even though he had nothing to do with the studies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it has been emphasized that none of Dr. Reuben’s co-authors over the years have been accused of scientific fraud, I find it hard to believe that so many people over so many years failed to notice even a whiff of a problem. My guess is that some of them probably at least sensed that something was not entirely kosher but remained silent because they trusted Dr. Reuben and liked being co-authors on papers with him. It was good for their careers. Alternatively, they just signed on without taking much responsibility for the actual manuscript, something that’s far too easy and tempting to do far too much of the time. Again, unfortunately the number of published papers counts when a scientist or clinical investigator is evaluated.&lt;br&gt;
Indeed, if you’ve noticed a bit of a parallel, here, you won’t be alone. The way Dr. Reuben’s co-authors signed on to his papers reminds me of the way physicians have signed on to p&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=192"&gt;harmaceutical company-sponsored seeding trials&lt;/a&gt;. For example, in the case of the infamous ADVANTAGE Trial, the first author of the main publication resulting from the trial, Dr. Jeffrey R. Lisse, did not have a role in data collection. Even I haven’t been immune. In fact, I used to wonder if I should have managed to get myself on more papers, regardless of my level of involvement, because my publication record, quite frankly, is probably not as good as it should be at this stage in my career. The temptation is always there. But, looking at this incident, one thing I can say about my publication record is that there are some damned good papers there published in excellent journals, and that I either wrote or heavily participated in the writing of each and every one of them. Even so, it would be nice to have several extras. However, the Reuben affair has cautioned me that I will be very careful to make sure that I am involved in the data analysis and the writing of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I wonder in the case of such massive fraud, and, no doubt so do my readers, is how so many fraudulent papers from one author could get past peer reviewers. One reason is that peer reviewers can only look at the data presented in the manuscript. They are not usually equipped to identify fraudulent data unless it’s blatantly obvious. That’s not to say that peer reviewers don’t catch obvious fraud (they do, the most common examples I’ve heard of being autoradiographs cropped or Photoshopped in suspicious ways or duplicated from other publications in different contexts, or what have you), but there is a presumption of honesty in science. Reviewers don’t start with the presumption that the data themselves in a manuscript might be fraudulent. Rather, they are on the lookout for problems in experimental design, analysis and interpretation of the data, and drawing conclusions from that data. Moreover, they only look at one manuscript at a time. Rarely do they have time to read the references cited, and if they do read cited references usually they don’t have time to do more than to pick a couple and then skim them. If an author’s other manuscripts are all fraudulent, it’s unlikely the peer reviewer would detect it, as he or she in essence works in a vacuum for each manuscript reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this incident does reveal is that there are almost always indications. If there’s one thing about science, it’s often messy. Results rarely always turn out the way one expects or wants. If they did, then science would be pretty useless. Often the results that lead to new discoveries are the anomalous results, the unexpected result. Dr. Reuben’s work suffered from what is in retrospect a very suspicious degree of consistency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, when you look at Scott’s output over the last 15 years, he never had a negative study,” said one colleague, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “In fact, they were all very robust results–where others had failed to show much difference. I just don’t understand why anyone would do this or how anyone could pull this off for so long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see an outlier, an investigator whose results are always more robust than those of his colleagues, be wary. It may not be scientific fraud. It may not even be mistaken or evidence of a bit of “data cleaning,” if you know what I mean. But it should send up red flags. Indeed, to bring up another example, I recently saw Brian Deer give a talk at the University of Michigan about the revelations of Andrew Wakefield’s fraudulent research that launched the decade-long MMR scare. He started out by saying that, when something looks too good to be true, it usually is too good to be true and that such was the case with Andrew Wakefield’s 1998 &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper. Unfortunately, however, often suspicious consistency–looking “too good to be true”–is all too often only obvious in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest failure of the scientific community in this case is that Dr. Reuben’s fraud was not discovered by other scientists trying to replicate his work as a basis for extending it. Rather, what brought Dr. Reuben to the attention of his hospital were two abstracts that he submitted for presentation. A hospital bureaucrat charged with keeping the hospital’s human subjects research in compliance with federal and state law noticed that no record of approval for human &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/health/research/11pain.html"&gt;subjects research could be found&lt;/a&gt; for the work presented in these abstracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Reuben’s activities were spotted by Baystate after questions were raised about two study abstracts that he filed last spring, Ms. Albert said. The health system determined that he had not received approval to conduct human research, Ms. Albert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baystate investigators determined that Dr. Reuben had concocted data for 21 studies, and the health system asked the journals in which those studies were published to withdraw them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly, we in the academic medical community seriously dropped the ball on this case. As I’ve heard pointed out elsewhere, that Dr. Reuben’s fraud was finally detected was not a triumph of science policing its own. Rather, it was a triumph of administrative due diligence. Actually, I’m not so sure it was even that, given that it took Baystate over 12 years to detect his fraud. One wonders if Dr. Reuben didn’t start with outright fraud. Perhaps back in the 1990s, he succumbed to the temptation to “clean up” his data by leaving out patients, tweaking values, or otherwise realigning the data to match his hypothesis. Once he started down that path, it became easier to do it more and more until finally he started just “making stuff up” and publishing it as though he had done the studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most angers me about this case is the massive betrayal of trust. For SBM to fulfill its promise of improving medical care for patients, the science underlying it must be at the very minimum trustworthy and free of fraud. That is the absolute lowest bar, the very first requirement that is necessary (although not sufficient), of the science behind any treatment. Moreover, the public quite rightly expects that its scientists, at the very least, will be honest about their results. Too much depends on it, especially in medical science, where it is people’s health that is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, much of Dr. Reuben’s work was underwritten by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the the very nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs combinations of which he studied. There is no evidence that Pfizer, for instance, which underwrote some of Dr. Reuben’s more recent work, was complicit in the fraud; indeed, I rather suspect that Pfizer was just as snookered as anyone else. More than likely, Pfizer picked Dr. Reuben because of his earlier work, which supported the use of its products. Even so, one can’t help but wonder if, once underwritten by Pfizer, Dr. Reuben felt pressure to produce results that supported the use of Pfizer drugs. Be that as it may, what this link to a pharmaceutical company means for those of us who defend science- and evidence-based medicine is that every crank alt-med site and blog on the Internet is going to be harping on this incident as The Proof That Conventional Medicine Is Hopelessly Corrupt and their favorite woo is being kept down by The Big Bad Pharma Man. The uber-quack-friendly site &lt;a href="http://www.NaturalNews.com/025833.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;NaturalNews.com&lt;/a&gt; has already run with it. Not only has Reuben put a stain on scientific medicine that will be very hard to erase, if it’s even possible at all, but he has made our work at SBM harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even worse than that, Reuben’s wasted huge amounts of resources and left a huge mess for his colleagues to clean up. It will take years for the studies he’s done to be either redone or for other investigators to find out if the very concept of multimodal analgesia is even valid. He’s screwed every anesthesiologist who, based largely on his work, came to accept this therapeutic modality as the best for their patients, and he’s screwed those patients, too. (As an aside, he’s also screwed a friend of mine who is the Chief of Surgical Oncology at Baystate. The two never worked together, but Dr. Reuben’s fraud has tainted the institution and, by extension, my friend.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to end on such a downer though. As bad as the Reuben fraud is, I can’t help but contrast it to an other recently discovered incident of scientific fraud, namely that committed by a hero of the antivaccination movement, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=384"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;. One huge contrast that I note is that there is no one out there starting up a “We support Dr. Scott Reuben” movement, claiming that he was framed, that it’s all a big conspiracy to get him. Not so Andrew Wakefield, for whom there is a &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/02/23/will-patrick-holford-be-calling-upon-his-mailing-list-to-sign-the-new-andrew-wakefield-petition/"&gt;misinformation- and logical fallacy-filled&lt;/a&gt; website proclaiming that &lt;a href="http://www.wesupportandywakefield.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;We Support Dr. Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile the antivaccine blog &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;, which had given Wakefield its &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/age-of-autism-awards-2008-galileo-award-dr-andrew-wakefield.html"&gt;Galileo Award for 2008&lt;/a&gt;, has relentlessly tried to &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/02/brian-deer-history-repeating-itself-as-farce.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;defend Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; and slime &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com"&gt;Brian Deer&lt;/a&gt;, the reporter who uncovered his fraud. Indeed, chief antivaccine propagandist, David Kirby, the ex-journalist who now apparently blogs full time for AoA, even &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/keith-olbermann-todays-be_b_166103.html"&gt;bragged&lt;/a&gt; about having persuaded Keith Olbermann to feature Brian Deer in one of his “Worst Person in the World” segments, apparently having &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/keith_olbermann_played_for_a_fool.php"&gt;played Olbermann for a fool&lt;/a&gt; by using Olbermann’s hatred of Rupert Murdoch to convince Olbermann that Brian Deer had some sort of horrific conflict of interest that he &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/brian_deer_responds_to_keith_olbermann.php"&gt;did not, in fact, have&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the antivaccine movement, led by AoA, continues to beat the drum attacking Brian Deer and &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/brian-deers-boss-joins-board-of-mmr-manufacturer-glaxosmithkline.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;tenuous conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt; that do not in any way detract from &lt;a href="http://briandeer.com/solved/solved.htm"&gt;Deer’s reporting&lt;/a&gt; on Wakefield, which is extensive and spans nearly 10 years. If you want to see evidence of one of the very real differences between science-based medicine and pseudoscience- or faith-based medicine, all you have to do is to compare the difference between the reaction to revelations of Dr. Reuben’s fraud in the anesthesiology community to that of the “autism biomedical” and antivaccine community to Dr. Wakefield’s fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this excuses Dr. Reuben or the scientific establishment for not having detected his fraud for so long. Such a failing will hurt us and provide the pro-quackery forces with fodder to attack SBM for years. However, it is still instructive to note that, when a scientist is detected as a fraud, he is immediately discredited and, in essence, shunned by the scientific community. Dr. Reuben’s career as an academic physician is almost certainly over; he is likely to be kicked out of the community of science with extreme prejudice. In marked contrast, in the realm of pseudoscience, such as the antivaccine movement, when scientific fraud is detected by one of their “scientists” promoting the vaccine-autism link, the reaction is to circle the wagons, defend the scientist who committed the fraud, and blame the accusations on a huge conspiracy between big pharma, the government, and various other nefarious forces to “suppress” their hero’s work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that somehow reassuring about scientific medicine, even in the depth of such a research scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img title="Charlie &amp;amp; Jim riding bikes in 2002 by kristina chew" src="http://www.change.org/photos/wordpress_copies/charlienov02-033-300x225.jpg" height="225" alt="" width="300"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;How is Charlie?&lt;/em&gt; we are often asked by friends and colleagues who genuinely mean it. In the face of this bald query I tend to cite the travail of Charlie’s latest challenge since these fully consume our energies. Yet whenever asked that question I also visualize my son in his most Charlie moment as he truly is; projecting peaceful easy feelings his blessed way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much less often folks ask &lt;em&gt;what does Charlie do?&lt;/em&gt; He rides bikes, I reply; or more precisely, we ride bikes together. Friends with some experience of Charlie’s unique manner generally inquire: "you mean a bike for two?" No, he rides his own bike, I explain. "In parks or playgrounds?" Nah, mostly in the street and from there we’re off to the races: sampling the soundtracks ("people let me tell ya ‘bout my best friend") from our 16 mile day-trippers to and fro No. Jersey’s Queen City and other historic venues. If you witnessed Charlie atop the bike in those graced moments the last thing you’d do is identify him primarily by “deficit.” Lest I forget…I believe…Help thou my unbelief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our friends share the will to believe, even those who for good reasons of their own prefer to be spared the pain of regular witness. We all struggle to resist the deficit-mode angle of vision, but how can a kid like Charlie do as we report? This was no linear ascent to glory believe me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summer 2001 we dropped everything and returned from the Mississippi Valley to our native New Jersey in pursuit of an appropriate school placement. Charlie steered his first two-wheeler with training wheels that summer at age four; loving every breeze and squeal. Yet he was soon tipping over aplenty training wheels and all (I’d hear the nightmarish voice of Howard Cosell in my head: Down goes Charlie! Down goes Charlie!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then late August of that summer 2001 found us speaking with a New York City firefighter at surf’s edge on the Jersey Shore while his six year old son rolled with the waves. It all starts at age five, he assured us. The firefighter was the kind of wonderful person you just knew saw only Charlie not the condition: he inspired great hope; he was much on our mind throughout that terrible tragic autumn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly we found ourselves wading doggedly across the sites of our fears: in late spring 2003, with Charlie struggling gamely in a new classroom and we three adjusting to a new town we decided to ride circles around his school building &lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; training wheels. It took quite a bit of hand-over-Charlie sneakers to position his feet o’er the pedals: the footwork seemed as awkward and unnatural to him as the teaching did to me despite hundreds of hours spent gratefully over the years in the presence of his devoted behavior therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through arduous hours I brooded and moped while intermittently lauding Charlie’s spirit and determination. This was one occasion when dad’s ADHD brain made good use of itself. In &lt;a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/anchor/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385496094&amp;amp;view=rg"&gt;Traveling Mercies&lt;/a&gt; the wonderful spiritual writer and memoirist Anne Lamott recalled speaking with a former associate of the Dalai Lama, who informed her that some good old human distraction is a blessing when something really precious needs its sweet time to be born. At one point that afternoon I remember looking up and saying "hey Charlie’s going wrong way down one-way" before it hit me, the kid was off and running on his bike under his own steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad’s done! My inner slacker exults. Not so fast bucco: while Charlie boasted an exquisite sense of his distance from inanimate objects (like the car mirrors he smoothly glided past with millimeters to spare) his depth perception afforded little or no instinct for gauging the space between himself and objects hurtling his way, like say fully-loaded SUVs. The practical solution was to keep him to our Mr. Inside, the curbside (the mirror side) at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie succeeded in mastering the forward pedaling motion at the expense of backward brake-pedaling; a small price to pay but a challenge that prompted our adoption of the "bicycle rodeo technique" as our best shot at slowing/stopping his two-wheeler. For well over a year when it was time for Charlie’s bike to stop his left shoulder was clasped firmly by dad’s right hand. The rodeo lent a little extra frisson to our regular outings: we grew balanced; in sync; a team. We went on road, off road; he even went off-levee once and found himself hip-deep in the Rahway River covered by bicycle and calling for me in voice of profound conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By age eight Charlie was able to squeeze his newly installed handbrakes: more patient discrete trials ("squeeze brakes") in the selfsame school parking lot. Soon he was calling out "red stop sign" (and better yet stopping at the sight) and acquiring the grace and poise of a touring master. But then autismland weighed in with a less than gentle series of reminders that saw Charlie—among other antics—shuck his moving bike for a maraud in an unfamiliar yard in an unfamiliar town. On many occasions during that stretch he returned home so visibly distraught, as if to feel cheated by the fleeting joy of freedom in motion. Sometimes he showed no interest at all in his bike or the increasingly spontaneous-improvised rides we shared. I lived for them and was far from ready to willingly relinquish his spirited company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like the true New Jerseyan he’d become Charlie always came back. Ahead of us were mishaps resulting from clipped tires and a clipped mirror; a ride in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park that had us both in tears on reaching the Pacific (I won’t speak for the nature of his); his growing to outpace me on the windward stretches of rides down the Jersey Shore. Last summer with &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/remembering-bart-blogher-and-some-books/"&gt;Kristina away overnight&lt;/a&gt; we boldly resolved to share a ride to Charlie’s favorite stand-alone hamburger joint via some of the least bike-friendly roadways the Garden State has to offer. On our rocky arrival he glowered at me as if to say: you put us through this now expect me to play the little gentleman? We rode slowly back home only to return later under motor; burgers and fries awaiting us as befitting a couple of sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quiverfull women accept as many children as God gives them as a demonstration of their radical faith and obedience as well as a means to advance his kingdom: winning the country for Christ by having more children than their adversaries. This self-proclaimed “patriarchy” movement, which likely numbers in the tens of thousands but which is growing exponentially, bases its arguments on Psalm 127: “Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one’s youth. Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They shall not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.” Quiverfull women commonly give birth to families of eight, 10 and 12 children, or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/notaclowncar.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://friendlyatheist.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/notaclowncar.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="346"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This has got to be the greatest example of a religious forcing female submission that I’ve ever heard, worse than even Islam. Women are nothing but wombs to these sick assholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of the article in Slate Magazine about this movement, Kathryn Joyce, has also written a book about them on them:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807010707?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0807010707"&gt;Quiverfull: Inside the Christian Patriarchy Movement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is absurd. The news took an extraordinary story of a man who after 20 years found himself capable of walking again because of perfectly unremarkable reasons, and spun it into a fantastic tale of a man who miraculously recovered because of a spider bite. This is just shameless sensationalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Thursday morning (US Pacific Time), March 12, 2009, a piece of debris came close enough the International Space Station to require the astronauts to take refuge in the Soyez module, just in case there was a collision. In the end, the debris passed by without incident.

&lt;p&gt;I experienced this event almost entirely through twitter. This essay is to share my experience about how this is an example of ways in which somebody can follow news in a format completely different from conventional news reporting. This experience is, obviously, peculiar to me, in that only I follow my set of twitter users, and this is my personal reaction to it. However, I believe that this kind of process is starting to occur for many more people and it changes the way those people will use conventional news reporting...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Phil Plait: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/thoughts-on-breaking-news-and-twitter/" title=""&gt;Thoughts on breaking news and Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The near hit of the ISS and a piece of space debris was quite the sensation this morning. It's given me some things to think about.

&lt;p&gt;First, as DaveP points out, the mainstream news hardly even had time to put up a note about the potential collision until, in many cases, the whole thing was over. Yet on Twitter we were right on top of it. I have Tweetdeck (a Twitter reader) always open on my Mac desktop, so I constantly see the feed. I saw Nancy Atkinson tweeting about it, and immediately started looking around for news (going to NASA TV helped). I started tweeting about it myself, and sending people Nancy's way to get info too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, by a few minutes before the event itself, thousands of people on Twitter were already getting the blow-by-blow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard of Twitter, I thought it was useless. Then a gunman held two people hostage at Johnson Space Center, and I tweeted info as I heard it. People really liked that, so I started tweeting Shuttle launches and landings, and people liked that too. What I've discovered is that Twitter is an awesomely useful tool for rapid dissemination of information. And as we saw with the fireball, it sends out misinformation rapidly, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what to do about that, except to try to have the ear of people with lots of followers, and send them the correct info. The more folks who hear it, the more who will "retweet" it, and the faster we can step on rumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's one problem with Twitter. But there's another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twice now I've received complaints that during these events, I tweet too much. That's an interesting thing. We're talking breaking news, and Twitter, we've seen, is profoundly useful in those situations. As news comes in, it gets out. Under normal circumstances, I don't tweet that much, so that's what people expect. When an event happens, though, I will increase my frequency by a factor of five or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see where that might irritate someone who follows me. But what can be done? I want to make sure that I'm getting information out as I find it out, and that means lots of updates. I certainly don't want to tick anyone off, but what other choice is there? Ignore the news? That doesn't work either.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/journalism_on_twitter.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/GMOZkJEXx70" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237183281304"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/mammoths_in_history.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/026384d976e61da1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History of Science"/><title type="html">Mammoths in History</title><published>2009-03-16T04:56:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T04:56:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/JxWFTxt5jGY/mammoths_in_history.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/mammoths_in_history.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Archy continues to post snippets of his &lt;a href="http://johnmckay.blogspot.com/2009/03/fragments-of-my-research-viii.html" title=""&gt;research on the history of the discoveries and descriptions of mammoths&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...More than 2 million flights pass over the city every year, most traveling to and from the metropolitan area's three busiest airports: John F. Kennedy, Newark, and LaGuardia. And all that traffic squeezes through a network of aerial routes first laid out for the mail planes of the 1920s. Aircraft are tracked by antiquated, ground-based radar and guided by verbal instructions issued over simplex radios, technology that predates the pocket calculator. The system is extremely safe--no commercial flight has been in a midair collision over the US in 22 years--but, because the Federal Aviation Administration treats each plane as if it were a 2,000-foot-tall, 6- by 6-mile block lumbering through the troposphere, New York is running out of air. 

&lt;p&gt;This is a nightmare for New York travelers; delays affect about a third of the area's flights. The problem also ripples out to create a bigger logjam: Because so many aircraft pass through New York's airspace, three-quarters of all holdups nationwide can be traced back to that tangled swath of East Coast sky....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/key_to_eliminating_us_flight_d.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ynXrPfI8PY8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237169862531"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/why_gandalf_never_married.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6bc7c4d4098f1873</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Books"/><title type="html">Why Gandalf Never Married?</title><published>2009-03-16T03:09:27Z</published><updated>2009-03-16T03:09:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Kph1AJgoxWE/why_gandalf_never_married.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/why_gandalf_never_married.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ansible.co.uk/misc/tpspeech.html" title=""&gt;1985 talk by Terry Pratchett&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;....One may look in vain for similar widespread evidence of wizards. In addition to the double handful of doubtful practitioners mentioned above, half of whom are more readily identifiable as alchemists or windbags, all I could come up with was some vaguely masonic cults, like the Horseman's Word in East Anglia. Not much for Gandalf in there.

&lt;p&gt;Now you can take the view that of course this is the case, because if there is a dirty end of the stick then women will get it. Anything done by women is automatically downgraded. This is the view widely held -- well, widely held by my wife every since she started going to consciousness-raising group meetings -- who tells me it's ridiculous to speculate on the topic because the answer is so obvious. Magic, according to this theory, is something that only men can be really good at, and therefore any attempt by women to trespass on the sacred turf must be rigorously stamped out. Women are regarded by men as the second sex, and their magic is therefore automatically inferior. There's also a lot of stuff about man's natural fear of a woman with power; witches were poor women seeking one of the few routes to power open to them, and men fought back with torture, fire and ridicule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to know that this is all it really is. But the fact is that the consensus fantasy universe has picked up the idea and maintains it. I incline to a different view, if only to keep the argument going, that the whole thing is a lot more metaphorical than that. The sex of the magic practitioner doesn't really enter into it. The classical wizard, I suggest, represents the ideal of magic -- everything that we hope we would be, if we had the power. The classical witch, on the other hand, with her often malevolent interest in the small beer of human affairs, is everything we fear only too well that we would in fact become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, it won't win me a PhD. I suspect that via the insidious medium of picture books for children the wizards will continue to practice their high magic and the witches will perform their evil, bad-tempered spells. It's going to be a long time before there's room for equal rites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of these books was &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0981631304/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;n=283155&amp;amp;s=books"&gt;Christian No More: A Personal Journey of Leaving Christianity and How You Can Leave Too&lt;/a&gt; by Jeffrey Mark. This book is more than a memoir; while it does contain Mark’s story, it is also much, much more. You can read the table of contents and some of the content of the book on &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/A2AV2Z2UWDDK1P"&gt;Jeff’s Amazon blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the book description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for everyone: Atheists will find excellent arguments to help them defend their positions; Agnostics will appreciate the clarification it brings; Christians who are struggling will find this book a great help in breaking free from their shackles as they learn exactly why there’s no possible way Christianity is true and why they don’t have to worry ever again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible says that the world’s languages began with the Tower of Babel. Today we know better. But how could the Bible contain stories that aren’t true? Author Jeffrey Mark was a devout Christian throughout his life until, during his early 30s, he began studying the Bible more seriously than he ever had. And that’s when he made the disturbing realization that so many stories were simply untrue. For him, this realization started with the Tower of Babel. That in turn launched a series of events that eventually led him to abandon his long-held beliefs. Letting go of his beliefs resulted in pain, anger, and distrust towards everyone around him. But slowly he was able to rebuild his life and come to terms with the realities of the world and ultimately find happiness. If you’ve ever questioned your beliefs, Jeff’s story will inspire you. Travel with him through his journey as he explores the deeper truths behind the Bible while discovering science, logic and reason, and ultimately revealing Christianity for what it really is. This is a book that every Christian must read! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the fold is a guest post by author &lt;a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendID=266894197"&gt;Jeffrey Mark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Jeffrey Mark, and I’m the author of a book called Christian No More. I wanted to share with all of you a bit about my book and why I wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up a devout Christian. Although we weren’t a hardcore, hellfire &amp;amp; brimstone type family, we went to church every week, which was enough for me to grow up believing without a doubt that God and Jesus are real. My faith was so strong that when I heard people say things like, “It’s okay to sometimes doubt,” I knew that never applied to me, because I had no doubt whatsoever. And that was my feeling right up into my 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my late 20s, there were things that started bothering me. The Bible had many stories in the Old Testament that I knew couldn’t be real. For instance, we knew languages didn’t all originate with the Tower of Babel. And we knew that the world was far, far older than the Bible tells us. This prompted me to start reading the Bible in more detail, to seek out the full truth. With these heavy-duty studies, I found many things that didn’t sit right; and so I did what made sense: I knew the stories and verses had to be true, but at the same I knew they couldn’t be real; so in my mind, I adjusted them until they made sense and worked. I called this adjustment “interpretation”. But over the course of about three years, these interpretations became weaker and weaker. They weren’t holding up to scrutiny. And over time I finally realized the stories simply weren’t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, of course, created a major problem in my mind. How could there be stories in the Bible that weren’t real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determine, I continued my studies, but this time I included studies outside of the Bible. I explored as much science as I could. And over time I found I believed less and less of what Christianity teaches us, until that fateful day when I realized I was forced to decide whether I even believed Jesus existed. And that was the defining moment: After about five years of struggling, I realized he wasn’t real. And that, by definition, was the moment I was no longer a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the journey was incredibly painful and difficult. I felt a huge amount of anger at the church for terrorizing me with threats of Hell. And I had an enormous feeling of emptiness. And that’s when I resolved to write a book. As a professional writer, I decided to cover many topics: Why the Bible simply cannot be real; what the Church is doing to people (especially children) with threats of Hell; what the Bible really says about things like Hell (very little, in fact). And I also decided to spend a good amount of time explaining how science really works, and why it’s not about faith but rather solid data, tests, and the scientific method. And I spent a lengthy chapter dismantling the Bible itself, going deep into the verses, and exploring what is and isn’t in the Bible and why what’s there is based totally in myth, having been heavily influenced by other myths of ancient times–myths that Christians today reject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all came together well, and the book has been very well received. David Mills, author of Atheist Universe found the book fascinating and said it’s sure to become “iconic” in the freethought community. Guy P. Harrison, author of 50 Reasons People Give For Believing in a God, called the book an “intellectual broadside” to Christianity. I’m constantly getting emails from people of all different faiths saying how much they like the book. It has helped some people walk away from Christianity, and atheists are especially enjoying it, because it lets them go into the mind of a (former) Christian and see what makes such a mind tick — and, more importantly, how to help people walk away from the faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me personally, writing this book has been a major re-awakening. I now call myself a Skeptic, a word that in the past I considered a negative term. When I was a Christian, I felt “skeptic” meant somebody who continuously doubts everything, no matter how clear, and argues to no end, and refuses to see what’s obvious. But now I realize it’s a positive thing: I don’t just eat everything up without proof. And for many things, the proof is there. Other times, it’s not. And now skepticism has become a guiding principle in my life; it’s actually a useful skill, or talent, if you will. For example, when coworkers get an idea into their heads about the way a project should go, I approach ideas with healthy skepticism. Is this reworking of a project really going to work, or is it simply something that somebody dreamed up with no real evidence that it will work? Since becoming a skeptic, it’s as if my life is finally complete. I don’t latch onto ideas mindlessly; instead, I’m open-minded and I listen, but reject ideas that make no sense, and only embrace ideas that are clearly real. And now, after Christianity, my life is complete.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>writerdd</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237166130613"><id gr:original-id="http://lizditz.typepad.com/i_speak_of_dreams/2009/03/do-you-have-a-child-who-struggles-socially-read-this.html">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e09d44d0ffa10e63</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Learning Disabilities"/><title type="html">Do You Have A Child Who Struggles Socially?

This was interesting, because most of the people in the course are not biology majors but had done a good job learning about cloning, genetic engineering, and other topics during the semester.  (This was also a nice break from giving weekly presentations, I am sure).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, as part of the discussion we also read several papers about science in movies.  One of them by Kirby (2003) is about scientists as consultants for Hollywood productions.  As I was reading it, I thought to myself, "I would probably do it, but not for personal payment -- if they funded my research that would be ok".  Then, on the following page, I read:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the available evidence, science consultants are far more likely to accept research funds, or no compensation at all, rather than actual payment for their services. One of the reasons for this situation is the unwillingness of scientists to take money for what they consider a “public service.” Many of the consultants I researched felt it was their “duty” as a scientist to impart knowledge to an uneducated public, including filmmakers, and that it would have been “unethical” for them to take money for this activity. For example, two of the consultants for the 1922 gland-based horror film A Blind Bargain(1922) felt that it would be “disreputable” for “medical researchers” to accept payment for their services, and they even requested that their names not be included in publicity material (see Riley, 1988).Likewise, Donald Francis of Genentech, Inc., who is most famous for his work on an AIDS vaccine, refused financial payment for his work as technical adviser for the film Outbreak(1995), accepting as compensation “only that his 17-year-old son, Oli, be allowed to observe the filming” (see Ganahl, 1995: 1E). Francis’ example underscores the conflict that science consultants face. On the one hand, they believe that as scientists they should give scientific advice freely to anyone who seeks knowledge. On the other hand, they are providing a specialized service for filmmakers and believe they should receive compensation of some type. To resolve this tension, consultants have come up with other forms of compensation that do not involve direct financial payment. In this regard, consultants who accept research funds rather than salary or consultation fees perceive that this action does not compromise their “ethics,” because the money will not go into their pockets but will go toward the production of “new knowledge.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;Science is an intriguing culture, no question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;____________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirby, DA (2003).

Schramm, Ph.D., professor and Ruth Merns Chair of Biochemistry at Einstein and senior author of the paper, hypothesized that antibiotics that could reduce the infective functions of bacteria, but not kill them, would minimize the risk that resistance would later develop.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dr. Schramm's collaborators at Industrial Research Ltd. earlier reported transition state analogues of an enzyme that interferes with "quorum sensing" — the process by which bacteria communicate with each other by producing and detecting signaling molecules known as autoinducers. These autoinducers coordinate bacterial gene expression and regulate processes — including virulence — that benefit the microbial community. Previous studies had shown that bacterial strains defective in quorum sensing cause less-serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rather than killing &lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; 0157:H7, the researchers aimed to disrupt their ability to communicate via quorum sensing. Their target: A bacterial enzyme, MTAN, that is directly involved in synthesizing the autoinducers crucial to quorum sensing. Their plan: Design a substrate to which MTAN would bind much more tightly than to its natural substrate — so tightly, in fact, that the substrate analog permanently "locks up" MTAN and inhibits it from fueling quorum sensing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To design such a compound, the Schramm lab first formed a picture of an enzyme's transition state — the brief (one-tenth of one-trillionth of a second) period in which a substrate is converted to a different chemical at an enzyme's catalytic site. (Dr. Schramm has pioneered efforts to synthesize transition state analogs that lock up enzymes of interest. One of these compounds, Forodesine, blocks an enzyme that triggers T-cell malignancies and is currently in a phase IIb pivitol clinical study treating cutaneous T-cell leukemia.)&lt;/p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Chemical Biology&lt;/em&gt; study, Dr. Schramm and his colleagues tested three transition state analogs against the quorum sensing pathway. All three compounds were highly potent in disrupting quorum sensing in both &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; 0157:H7. To see whether the microbes would develop resistance, the researchers tested the analogs on 26 successive generations of both bacterial species.  The 26th generations were as sensitive to the antibiotics as the first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In our lab, we call these agents everlasting antibiotics," said Dr. Schramm. He notes that many other aggressive bacterial pathogens — &lt;em&gt;S. pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;N. meningitides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; — express MTAN and therefore would probably also be susceptible to these inhibitors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ok, here we go.  How big was the population size tested?  How much is 26 generations in bacterial timescales?  Let's think about this.  One person taking antibiotics would have &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;billions&lt;/span&gt; of bacteria in his/her gut.  A week on antibiotics is about 350 generations if you consider 30 minutes per.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How about the possibility of a new mutation or lateral transfer from some other species?  Yes, selection may result in resistance easily in bacteria if some individuals already carry a resistance gene, but I would &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;never &lt;/span&gt;bet against some mutation occurring down the line and leading to a reproductive advantage -- they don't have to survive while all others are killed for selection to occur and therefore for the new resistant trait to increase rapidly in proportion.  Natural selection is about relative reproduction, not necessarily survival alone.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-7426629402165142870?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/R1fvILlctV0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237157221933"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1239">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc649e23bb31bd6f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and the law"/><title type="html">On not writing anything</title><published>2009-03-15T22:08:32Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T22:08:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1239" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As anyone who blogs knows or soon learns, doing so makes you a whole lot more transparent than you might otherwise wish to be. In fact, writing anything like books, articles, or blogs makes you an attractive target for people who may not appreciate what you say. No clearer example can be found than the vetting process the government inflicts on nominees for high-level appointments, such as the US Supreme Court. It’s unfortunate that the persons who finally survive these processes are often are the ones who have written little or nothing about which they can be criticized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with putting anything in print is made very clear by Paul Barrett in his Harvard Magazine &lt;a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2009/03/judicial-interpretation"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of a new book by Lawrence Tribe,  &lt;em&gt;The Invisible Constitution. &lt;/em&gt;Barrett feels that Tribe’s candid views about the US Constitution automatically eliminate him as a possible nominee to the highest court in the land—primarily because he clearly elaborates his own positions  (reasonable, to me anyway) about the hot topic of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism"&gt;originalist&lt;/a&gt; theory of interpretation.    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s so bad about writing your legal theories? Nothing, except it opens the door for opponents to grill Tribe mercilessly about them  if he actually is ever nominated. All we need to do is recall other such hearings, starting about the time of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/Robert_Bork"&gt;Robert Bork’s&lt;/a&gt; unsuccessful experiences. These days it’s apparently safer to avoid explaining anything your own legal theories and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer home to linguistics, I’ve been puzzled by why many linguists who work in law cases don’t write much about their experiences of using linguistics to help resolve civil and criminal courtroom battles. But now I’m beginning to understand. One of the first experiences expert witness linguists face when they’re cross-examined by opposing lawyers is a barrage of challenges about anything they have ever committed to print. The idea is to impeach their testimony or prevent them from even taking the witness stand.  If the linguists have written anything that comes close to being controversial, wrong, or inconsistent, they can expect to have to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than being annoying, what’s so bad about that? Several things. For one, the field of linguistics is not static. What was acceptable and standard in one decade soon can become passé. What we have said earlier can come back to haunt us, making us look inconsistent or whimsical rather than a sign of our ability to grow with the developing science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, any competent expert learns new things. For example, it would be unlikely for linguistic expert witnesses to have made use of pragmatics or speech act theory in the early 70’s,when nothing much was known about them. But this fact of history doesn’t discourage a lawyer from asking why they didn’t use it in their earlier analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, most of us are prone to make mistakes once in a while. Our earlier analysis might contain errors, even small ones, of some kind.  Humans tend to be like that. In one of my earlier books, for example, I accidentally (stupidly?) reversed the definitions of slander and libel. I knew better, but somehow this gaff made it through several layers of editing and into print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes can be just as important for expert witnesses as they are for Supreme Court nominees. It will be sad indeed if the grilling and vetting process prevents brilliant lawyers like Lawrence Tribe  from becoming a Justice, and it will be equally sad if the fear of having our writings come back to haunt us prevents linguists from sharing important learning experiences with others in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237155989172"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/peer_support_groups">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/955939bb29501637</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Peer Support Groups</title><published>2009-03-15T22:24:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T22:24:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/peer_support_groups" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vertigogen/1443109491/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1367/1443109491_ddb6a940db_m.jpg" alt="two young men holding hands spin together on a rock, each man supports the other counterbalancing the centrifugal force" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Announcements and news articles about social support groups, programs, or workshops for autistic adults get posted on the Internet and by various organizations.  Many of these groups involve non-autistic professionals, therapists, or "typical peer" mentors leading a group to meet social educational goals.  Occasionally recreation is a goal in addition to learning some sort of life skill, or seen as the "fun way" to acquire the skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "peer" in the relevant sense here &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/peer"&gt;is defined&lt;/a&gt; as "a person who is equal to another in abilities, qualifications, age, background, and social status."  Thus is has always seemed curious to me that the word "peer" is used to refer to those "typically developing" individuals who clearly are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; considered equal with autistic individuals, particularly in the areas of ability, social status, and background.  If there was true equality between autistic people and their "typical peers" there would be no push to bring the autistic people to the same "level" as those "typical peers."  When a person of one social class is put in a facilitation role with people of another social class, there is by definition a power imbalance, an inequity. This doesn't mean "bad," for example an 8th grade teacher facilitating 8th grade students is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing!  But it is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; from two 8th grade students interacting with out the presence of the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is value in learning from someone who is not like one's self, there is also value in learning from people who share the same experiences--people who are true peers in ability, social status, background, etc.  Autistic people can and do learn from each other, and often what is learned is deeply useful or comprehensible specifically because there is a more equitable basis for the information exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer (in the sense of run by and for autistic adults) social support groups, programs, and workshops are more rare especially in person than traditionally run groups, but they do exist.  They exist online in private mailing groups and &lt;a href="http://community.livejournal.com/asperger/"&gt;semi-public online fora&lt;/a&gt; (online peer groups may outnumber more traditional therapist-facilitator type groups?).  They exist in local communities as both &lt;a href="http://www.aspdx.org/"&gt;more structured&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/PDX-Autistic-Self-Advocacy-Network/"&gt;more free-form&lt;/a&gt; social groups.  They exist on an international scale, including in the form of a &lt;a href="http://www.autreat.com/"&gt;major conference&lt;/a&gt; that has been successfully ongoing for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autistics-only or autistic-run groups may provide some things that therapist or mentor facilitated groups can't, like the ability to socialize or recreate without having to "accomplish" something, the ability to feel safe from critique, judgement, or scrutiny by non-autistics (especially those like therapists whose job it is to make those judgments), an opportunity to share a common culture, and the ability to freely exchange strategies with those who have "been there."  Being able to do something for ourselves can also help with self-efficacy and self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of autistic-run peer groups and programs will hopefully continue evolve, grow, and multiply with time for those individuals who find value in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; I am in no way meaning to devalue more traditional therapy-based social or support groups or mentorship models.  I am also in no way meaning to suggest that autistic people and non-autistic people can't have equitable relationships--be true peers (I have many, many non-autistic friends who are my true peers!).  Autistic-run and autistic-only groups and more traditional models &lt;em&gt;are not mutually exclusive&lt;/em&gt;--both have value!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237150945957"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/af8fdb2c7f1bbda1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Odyssey</title><published>2009-03-15T21:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T21:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/odyssey" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autismland/3356363991/" title="The Pantheon on the Acropolis by autismvox, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3426/3356363991_cf977d1fb7_m.jpg" height="180" alt="The Pantheon on the Acropolis" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So here I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right---I'm in Greece for the week, with a group of undergraduates from my college. We'll be traveling around the Peloponnese while reading ancient Greek tragedy and comedy, philosophy, and history. I'm not certain about internet access, so my responding to comments and emails this week may be sporadic/erratic. We're indeed having a bit of a nomadic existence here, traveling to a number of cities and sites each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trip is so over-loaded with significance for me that I find it really hard to believe I am indeed on it. I've never been to Greece---nothing unusual about that, I know. But, since I am a classics professor and teach Latin, ancient Greek, and the literature and culture of the ancient Mediterranean world----I've felt my never having been to Greece to be something of a gap in my professional background. Years ago, while in graduate school, I had traveled around Europe but never to Greece. I figured I'd "get there" eventually and, who knows---after Charlie was born---take him with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never foresaw that Charlie would be born with a disability and that he'd need extra-extra attention over the years of his childhood and into his adulthood; that it'd be nearly impossible to leave him so Jim and I could travel together, that he'd need me to keep his routine and the orderliness of his life in check. Over the years, it became clear to me that it was more and more unlikely that I'd ever be able even to leave Charlie overnight. I've only been away for a few nights once since Charlie was born: A few years ago, I went to Maryland for a faculty summer seminar. That is, I was within driving distance, and Jim could drive to get me---there was no ocean between us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only planned the trip because last year Charlie, after so many struggles, was doing manifestly well in his school classroom and at home; had I known he would &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/in_transition"&gt;struggle&lt;/a&gt; and things reach a crisis point, I would never have given a thought to something like.........travel in a foreign country. I mean, come on.......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my students who I've known since I started my job at &lt;a href="http://www.spc.edu"&gt;Saint Peter's College&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 are going. More than a few of them have been unceasingly supportive. They are graduating this year and it seemed a more than fine way to thank them for helping me in my job---there's been many a day when I wasn't sure I could do it, wasn't sure I could keep juggling teaching and advising and phone calls about Charlie and the need to meet the school bus and the lack of babysitters for a kid like him and everything everything else. The students have provided kindly support and always been understanding and it seems a very grand thing to be able to, as it were, give them a splendid opportunity to end their college years with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the trip is a very personal odyssey. It's brought back thoughts and memories about old dreams and aspirations and plans; about a time when motherhood was a non-existent thought in my mind. I can pretty much guarantee you that, if you told me I would have the life I do now, I'd be hard-pressed to believe you and to imagine it. And, to want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here I am, the mother of a child on the autism spectrum with some very severe challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And already eager to hear about the adventures brewing on the homefront.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237150880283"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/15/shuttle-launches-tonight-at-1943-eastern-time/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8d9ab1e3732e9096</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Shuttle launches tonight at 19:43 Eastern time</title><published>2009-03-15T20:45:54Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T20:45:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/15/shuttle-launches-tonight-at-1943-eastern-time/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: The Shuttle launched right on time in a picture-perfect lift-off. It’s on its way to the space station, and is scheduled to dock on Tuesday.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Space Shuttle Discovery &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html"&gt;is scheduled to launch at 19:43 tonight Eastern time&lt;/a&gt; (23:43 UT). It will go to the space station and, among other things, install solar panels which are expected to make the ISS the third brightest object in the sky, after the Sun and Moon, brighter even than Venus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be covering the launch on Twitter as usual, except that I’m trying something new: &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BANews"&gt;I’ve created a new account called BANews&lt;/a&gt; that is just for breaking astronomy and space news. It’s just an experiment to see how people like it; this way people who follow my regular feed don’t have to see 40 updates in an hour from me. I’ll post a handful of times from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;my regular feed&lt;/a&gt; so people know to sign on to the other one. You can also follow &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/NASA"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/milesobrien"&gt;Miles O’Brien&lt;/a&gt; for more Shuttle info.

&lt;blockquote&gt;.....only a small fraction of the top 100 papers ranked by the number of citations (17 of 100) were published by single authors.....a published paper resulting from collaborative work has a higher chance of attracting more citations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can discuss the fallacy if you want, but I am much more interested in the next question that Daniel asks - are solo authors and groups of authors inherently attracted to different kinds of problems, or if solo vs. group dynamics make some projects more conducive for solo work and others for group collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the implication is that solo authors are less interesting. Instead, I believe that solo authors probably work on different problems. (Hint: This could be the subject of a study of its own!)

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of something I call problem inertia. For collaboration to occur, several people must come together and agree to a joint project. Sometimes money is required to pay the assistants or the students. All of these factor means that small problems or risky problems will be ignored in favor of safe bets. To put it bluntly, Microsoft will not sell PHP plugins! Hence, statistically, teams must be deliberate and careful. Also, fewer problems can be visited: even if the selected problem is a bad one, changing the topic in mid-course might be too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An autonomous author can afford to take more risks. Even more so if he has a permanent position. This may explain why Peter Turney seems to believe that researchers lack ambition. They may simply be rational: if it takes you three weeks to even get started on a project, you cannot afford many false starts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he than quotes &lt;a href="http://www.blog.sethroberts.net/2008/12/21/are-you-having-trouble-getting-grants/" title=""&gt;Seth Roberts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One reason my self-experimentation was effective was it didn't depend on grants. No matter what I found, no matter how strange or upsetting or impossible or weird the results might be, I could publish them and continue to investigate them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what I think he means is that groups jump on bandwagons, and bandwagoners are more common, thus bandwagoners will cite other bandwagoners more. Solo authors can do weird stuff and only very few other people will work on the same stuff, or similar enough stuff to warrant a citation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If thousands are studying process X in rats, they will tend to cite each other and easily get grants for collaborative work. They have little incentive to cite your work on that same process X that you study in the Platypus, and nobody else in the world studies it in the Platypus so there's not a large group (or anyone) out there to cite your stuff. But if you find something really revolutionary in Platypus that cannot be discovered in the rat - then your high risk resulted in a huge payoff (not to mention you will get lots of invitations to give talks at meetings as the organizers will like to have someone 'weird' - "that Platypus guy, snicker" - attract their audience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the progress of science, both types of research need to be done. And the lack of citations for risky single-author work should not be used as a measure of quality of that work or as impediment to career advances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agree or disagree?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Abstract: "Academic libraries cannot pay the regularly escalating subscription prices for scholarly journals. These libraries face a crisis that has continued for many years revealing a commercial system that supports a business model that has become unsustainable. This paper examines the "serials crisis," as it has come to be known, and the economics of the academic journal publishing industry. By identifying trends within the industry, an analysis of the industry is undertaken using elements of the five forces framework developed by Michael Porter. Prescriptions are offered concerning what can be done and what should be done to address this problem."

&lt;p&gt;--------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As can be noted from the table, the operating profit margins for Elsevier in the Science and Medical segment are extraordinarily high.  For example, in the year 2000, the operating profit margin for the Science and Medical segment was more than 8 times that of the margin for the larger industry.  These high margins exist even as critics question the value provided by the journal publishers.  In an investment analysis report of Reed Elsevier (referred to by its ticker symbol REL), a Deutsche Bank analyst argues that the value added to the publication process by the academic publishers is not high enough to explain the margins that are earned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;blockquote&gt;In justifying the margins earned, the publishers, REL included, point to the highly skilled nature of the staff they employ (to pre-vet submitted papers prior to the peer review process), the support they provide to the peer review panels, including modest stipends, the complex typesetting, printing and distribution activities, including Web publishing and hosting.  REL employs around 7,000 people in its Science business as a whole.  REL also argues that the high margins reflect economies of scale and the very high levels of efficiency with which they operate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    We believe the publisher adds relatively little value to the publishing process.  We are not attempting to dismiss what 7,000 people at REL do for a living.  We are simply observing that if the process really were as complex, costly and value-added as the publishers protest that it is, 40% margins wouldn't be available. [19]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement by Deutsche Bank is an astonishing comment on the profitability of the industry.  The notion that Elsevier, and therefore the other commercial publishers, add "little value to the publishing process" and cannot justify the high profit margins is significant.  This statement by Deutsche Bank, while aimed towards investors, reveals the skepticism of investment analysts regarding the value that Elsevier, and therefore other firms with similar business models, claim to add to the publishing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the large publishers provide little value-added, what explains their apparently high profit margins and ability to consistently raise prices?&lt;/p&gt;

Dana is my daughter. She IS so beautiful. I’m in tears as I write this. PLEASE INOCULATE. Don’t let others suffer what we are going through. It’s total devastation &amp;amp; heart break.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Governments &amp;amp; health regulatory bodies need to provide support to families by providing information &amp;amp; medical vaccinations to the whole community. We received nothing. The GP didn’t suspect whooping cough, even though there’s an epidemic here, our birthing doctor &amp;amp; hospital didn’t warn us of risks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Kev&lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1976"&gt; I read of&lt;/a&gt; the sad and preventable death of &lt;a href="http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2009/03/12/whooping-cough-claims-life-of-Lennox-Head-infant/"&gt;Dana Elizabeth McCaffery, &lt;/a&gt; who died at four weeks of age from whooping cough. Why did she get the disease? Because she was too young to be vaccinated, and was exposed to an older child or an adult who had the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“&lt;a href="http://www.northernstar.com.au/story/2009/03/12/whooping-cough-claims-life-of-Lennox-Head-infant/"&gt;The vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; on the North Coast are the worst in Australia. This is why we have so many incidences in this area compared with other parts of Australia.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
“Parents should be alarmed, whooping cough kills little babies. We must get our vaccination rates up so adults don&amp;#39;t pass the disease on to babies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;

After failing to block Dawkins from speaking at OU, the &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,3656,Is-Oklahoma-Investigating-Richard-Dawkins-Free-Speech,Greg-Lukianoff"&gt;Oklahoma legislature is looking for excuses to retroactively punish the university for spending money on his visit&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to have this idea that academics they dislike should always work for free, while the ones they like ought to be unquestioningly showered with honoraria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the way the system works. Everyone in academia knows that student groups get small allotments of cash to use as they see fit to promote their organization and ideas; this usually works in the conservatives&amp;#39; favor, because if you look at any university&amp;#39;s roster of student organizations, there&amp;#39;ll be a dozen or more Christian clubs at the trough and maybe one or two, if you&amp;#39;re lucky, freethought clubs. If they want to play that game, bring it on — let&amp;#39;s make Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and Campus Crusade for Christ squeal when we apply the restrictions uniformly and cut them off. Or perhaps the Oklahoma legislators are intending to apply a religious bias to their disbursement of funds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, academic departments have small pots of money for bringing in speakers. Is Oklahoma going to meddle directly in the decisions of every unit on a campus? Is their version of "academic freedom" just a fancy justification for micromanagement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's all moot anyway in this case. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2009/03/dawkins_coup_de_grace_in_oklah.php"&gt;Dawkins waived his speaking fee for the Oklahoma event&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, recently &lt;a href="http://ocolly.com/2008/09/24/ben-stein-returns-to-osu-no-you-still-can&amp;#39;t-win-his-money/"&gt;Ben Stein billed OSU &lt;b&gt;$60,000&lt;/b&gt; to speak&lt;/a&gt; — where&amp;#39;s the investigation there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly support what Prof. Walbot has to say.  One way to think about it: she's talking about the difference between the standards you ought to apply in order to believe something, and the standards you ought to apply in order to publish it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Unfortunately, pit-bull reviewers are roughly balanced by cream-puffs, so that the refereed literature is simultaneously polluted by junk and bereft of some worthwhile stuff. Some glimmers of what might be a better system can be seen here and there on the web —  &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/"&gt;arXiv.org&lt;/a&gt; is the best known — but given the difficulty of the problem and the cultural conservatism of the academy, change is likely be slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~peter/"&gt;Peter McBurney&lt;/a&gt; has reminded me of a classic paper by J. M. Chambers and Agnes M.

I recently received my first issue, &lt;a href="http://www.archaeology.co.uk/issues/ca-228.htm"&gt;#228 (March '09)&lt;/a&gt;, and I found it an enjoyable read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all, I liked James Barrett's and Adam Slater's piece on their recent fieldwork at the Brough of Deerness, Mainland, Orkney. This scenic and Scandy-flavoured site would have interested me anyway, but now I also happened to have &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2008/06/orkney_field_trip.php"&gt;visited it&lt;/a&gt; last June in the company of Barrett and the Brough's 1970s excavator Chris Morris. That visit took place as part of a conference excursion, and weeks later the new excavations opened. A very timely report!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An article celebrating the centennial of the Scottish and Welsh Royal Commissions is mainly interesting thanks to lovely pictures with intriguing captions. And a feature on WW2 Home Guard defenses in a London suburb - remains of the local militia's preparations for an invasion that happily never took place - is difficult to appreciate for a citizen of a country that hasn't seen war for two centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all a finely designed and interesting magazine. I look forward to the next issue!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/current_archaeologys_march_iss.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/fpCzIhMdL90" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237132068039"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/godless_in_montgomery.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/272e2262bb425878</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Godless in Montgomery</title><published>2009-03-15T16:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T16:15:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/afIHiHC5CjI/godless_in_montgomery.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/godless_in_montgomery.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/MontgomeryFreethought/"&gt;freethinkers of Montgomery, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; are looking to grow.

Now it’s being reported that German meteorite hunter Thomas Grau has found fragments of it on an island off the coast of Denmark. &lt;a href="http://nachrichten.t-online.de/c/18/09/97/60/18099760.html"&gt;Here’s the story in German&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="http://avisen.dk/meteor-fundet-paa-lolland_105021.aspx"&gt;in Danish&lt;/a&gt;. [Update: more info (in Danish) and pictures are at the&lt;a href="http://geologi.snm.ku.dk/nyheder_gm/nyhed13032009/"&gt; Geologisk Museum site&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to commenter jf below for that!].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imo.net/fireball/report"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/danish_meteorites.jpg" alt="Meteorites found on an island off Denmark"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Apparently (using Babel fish and my own rusty knowledge of German) Grau studied the video of the fireball and collected eyewitness reports, and used this to track the path of the meteor. A lot of it lay over water, but there was an island in a likely spot called Lolland. He searched, and found small chunks of meteorites there. Normally, I’d have my doubts that these were associated with that particular fireball, but he claims there were in a small crater, which indicates a fresh fall. The picture shown here is from Grau himself of the rocks &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I’ve never seen meteorites piled up like that before, though my experience with this is limited. One or two skeptical alarm bells are going off in my head — the odd pattern, coupled with no eye witnesses on the island itself that night (it was cloudy), plus what are the chances of finding such a small cluster of meteorites on a 1200 square kilometer island? — but they have been given to a museum which I hope is studying them thoroughly. I’m not saying this has been faked, don’t get me wrong, but it’s just weird. I’d like to get more information on this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meteorites are carbonaceous chondrites, a relatively rare class of rock that are considered unprocessed; that is, pretty much unchanged since their formation out of the solar nebula. This makes them very old — I have a small specimen that’s been dated as 4.57 billion years old, older than the Earth itself! — and very valuable, as they are tracers of what conditions were like while the planets were forming. They also sometimes have amino acids in them, meaning that by studying them we can get some insight into what the precursor conditions for life were like in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if this all pans out, it’ll be a major find for science. I’ll note that this was why I was so excited about &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/15/fireball-over-texas/"&gt;the Texas fireball in February&lt;/a&gt;– the more eye witnesses you get, and video of course, the more likely you can find the meteorites themselves… &lt;a href="http://geology.com/meteorites/meteorite-hunting.shtml"&gt;and in that case some were eventually found&lt;/a&gt;, too. So if you see a bright fireball, &lt;a href="http://www.imo.net/fireball/report"&gt;report it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, I had just the thing: I wanted to learn more about the pragmatic effects of attaching an intensive like &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;damn&lt;/em&gt; to positive and negative adjectives of various strengths. It is clear that &lt;em&gt;superb&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; horrible&lt;/em&gt; are emotively positive and negative, respectively. What about &lt;em&gt;totally superb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;totally horrible&lt;/em&gt;? We have a lot of evidence from online product reviews about what the intensive signals, but the reactions to this evidence are sometimes skeptical. People worry about the specialized form of the reviews, the reliability of the meta-data, and so forth. Fair enough. This looks like a job for the Mechanical Turk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:15px"&gt;Step 1: Data prep&lt;/span&gt; I extracted from the &lt;a href="http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/jQ0ZGZiM/readme.html"&gt;UMass Amherst Linguistics Sentiment Corpora&lt;/a&gt; all the words with particular distributions across the five-star rating categories. Intensives appear mainly in the one-star and five-star reviews, distributed equally in those extreme categories. Emotively positive adjectives typically correlate with the rating categories, rising steadily in frequency from one to five stars. Emotively negative adjectives like &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt; correlate inversely with the rating categories, falling off steadily from one to five stars. And words like &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;em&gt; somewhat&lt;/em&gt; are largely confined to the middle of the rating scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="shapes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/basic-shapes.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/basic-shapes.jpg" alt="Shapes for a variety of representative words. Click to enlarge" width="475" height="134"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:15px"&gt;Step 2: Data format&lt;/span&gt; I combined a subset of the intensives with  a subset of the positive and negative adjectives to form phrases like &lt;em&gt;totally superb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;totally horrible.&lt;/em&gt; I put these in a list with the unmodified adjectives, threw in some fillers like &lt;em&gt;possibly superb&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; quite&lt;/em&gt;, shuffled them up, and put them in a file, one phrase per line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
phrase
wow
mostly
fairly superb
absolutely helpful
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first row gives the name of the column. (There can be multiple, comma-separated columns, each with its own name.) I had 43 phases in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:15px"&gt;Step 3: HIT design&lt;/span&gt;  I used the Mechanical Turk Web interface to create my basic &lt;a href="https://requester.mturk.com/mturk/help?helpPage=requester"&gt;Human Intelligence Task &lt;/a&gt;(HIT) design.&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll#fn"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; Here's what it looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="background-color:#dddddd"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing emotivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the following word or phrase and assess its emotivity on the scale provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;${phrase}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0" border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;+3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Highly emotively &lt;b&gt;positive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;+2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Emotively positive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;+1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Somewhat emotively positive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not emotive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Somewhat emotively negative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Emotively negative&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Highly emotively &lt;b&gt;negative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ${phrase} piece is a placeholder for the phrases in my list. When I clicked &amp;quot;Publish&amp;quot;, Mechanical Turk created 43 HITS of this form, one for each value of ${phrase} drawn from my input data file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I requested 50 assignments for each of my 43 HITs, for a total of 2150 jobs. I was paying $0.01 for each HIT, and Amazon tacks on a surcharge, so the total cost for this was $32.25 ($21.50 + surcharge). I paid this amount to Amazon (it's just like buying a book from them). When I published my HITs, the $32.25 disappeared from my account. Amazon pays the workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:15px"&gt;Step 4: Wait a few hours&lt;/span&gt; I sat back and waited for my results. The first time I requested a batch of HITs like this, I thought I would have all the results in a week or so. That time, I had them in two hours. (It was a Friday afternoon.)  I had to wait about five hours for all of the above to come in.  When I have asked workers to do more intricate things like provide text, the results have come at a slower pace, but they've always finished in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="fn"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; The command-line tools work well, but the styling options seem to be more limited than those provided by the Web interface, which is also easier to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="results"&gt;2. Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that, true to their label, intensives intensify. Here's an example involving the strongly positive modifier &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/awesome-totally-awesome.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/awesome-totally-awesome.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge" width="475" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a box-and-whisker plot, but with the individual data points displayed (jittered left and right so that they don't sit atop each other). The thick black lines are the median values. The box picks out the core of the response data. For the intensive versions, the box has collapsed and the median line is almost hidden; essentially all the responses were at the very top of the positivity scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With negative adjectives, the effect is largely the same, but on the negative end of the scale. Here is a look at &lt;em&gt;disappointing&lt;/em&gt;, which has less variation than &lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt; when unmodified but which an intensive can push all the way to the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/disappointing-totall-disappointing.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/disappointing-totall-disappointing.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge" width="475" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adjectives like &lt;em&gt;superb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt;, already extreme in their own right, the picture is slightly different, but still very much in line with the notion that intensives push scalar predicates further along their scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/superb-absolutely-superb.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/superb-absolutely-superb.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge" width="475" height="268"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the median values of both are at the highest point on the scale. But the intensified version is less likely to stray below this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these results are completely in line with the U-shape for intensives &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll#shapes"&gt;seen above&lt;/a&gt;: sometimes it combines with positive adjectives, sometimes with negative ones. In both cases, it pushes the sentiment out to the extremes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name="assessment"&gt;3. Assessment of Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might say that this is not an especially surprising result. I agree. If the results had been too surprising, I'd have lost faith in Mechanical Turk. The role these results play in my research is to fill a small empirical hole. It's important to have it filled, and it would have been difficult and/or costly to fill it with a normal experimental set-up at my university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found the Mechanical Turk workers to be conscientious on the whole. I've gotten a few messages from them. One was having trouble with the buttons (I promptly blamed Amazon), another had misentered his intended choice, and a third had a question about what I was after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the workers are incentivized to do well. It is possible for requesters to approve/disapprove their work, and one can limit one's HITs to workers at or above certain approval thresholds. Thus, doing well leads to higher approval ratings, which opens up more and better jobs to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this, workers are highly likely to try to model the requester's expectations. If you display an image, they are likely to try to describe the whole image if given the chance, because they are likely to assume that you are doing image annotation. If your instructions reveal that you are after a particular effect, they are likely to strive for it. Similar factors threaten regular psycholinguistic experiments too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look back over the above plots, you see outliers. It happens that some of these are the same people over and over again; each data point has a worker ID attached to it, so it is easy to identify these outliers. These might be non-native speakers, trouble-makers, people with unreliable browsers, etc. They can be dealt with separately. Again, one has to make similar moves in the lab, e.g., for people who claim native competence in language X and then turn out to be struggling with their first classes in X, for people who go on auto-pilot two-thirds of the way through the experiment, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my considered view is that Mechanical Turk is a useful tool for language researchers, and that it can only become more useful if we exchange notes on our experiences with it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Potts</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237130294121"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1232">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/375db4344f842c35</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Semantics"/><title type="html">SemFest 10</title><published>2009-03-15T15:17:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T15:17:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1232" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Stanford Semantics Festival (SemFest for short) took place Friday and Saturday. A program, with links to the abstracts for the papers, is available &lt;a href="http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/semgroup/semfest2009/semfest09.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This was a special event in at least two senses: it was #10 (a nice round number), and it brought back quite a few Stanford alumni to give papers, so it was something of a reunion. So, in addition to speakers who have some current association with Stanford, there were also speakers from: Yale, Ohio State, UCSD, Chicago, Manchester, Salford, Texas (Austin), Minnesota, Cycorp, Northwestern, Nevada (Reno), and Wellesley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to many papers on English, and many that cited various languages in passing, there were papers on Guaraní, Ulwa (Nicaragua), Matses (Amazonia), Mandarin, Basque, Italian, Vedic, and creole languages. On child language, language comprehension, and grammaticalization. There was a pair of papers back to back having to do with &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; in English, and calling on some heavy-duty formalization to take context, expectation, and the like into account: Amaral and Del Prete on sentences like "His career ended almost before it started", conveying 'his career ended shortly after it started' (and parallel examples in Italian); and Condoravdi and Kaufmann on counterfactual &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; ("The police defused the bomb before it exploded") versus explicit counterfactuals ("If the police hadn't defused the bomb, it would have exploded").

Hmmm. Makes a fellow really want to see what horror was wreaked in the censored item: Pornography? Personal defamation? Embarrassing revelation? Alas, it's nothing quite so juicy. You can find a &lt;a href="https://www.sott.net/articles/show/177635-How-to-spot-a-hidden-religious-agenda"&gt;copy of the pulled article&lt;/a&gt; (isn&amp;#39;t it sweet how the web makes it almost impossible to actually make history disappear?): it&amp;#39;s all about how to spot a religious agenda in so-called science books that the creationists like to peddle — basic stuff like code words, such as &amp;quot;Darwinist&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;materialism&amp;quot;, or the usual spacey interpretations of quantum physics, or the habit of believing that an argument from consequences has any relevance to the truth of a matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It mentions some specific examples, such as James Le Fanu, Denyse O'Leary, and &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but these are all perfectly good and accurate instances of religiously-motivated products. Did one of them complain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am troubled by the apparent knee-jerk retraction of a legitimate article that is critical of creationism simply because there was a &amp;quot;complaint&amp;quot; (I&amp;#39;d also be concerned if a creationist article was yanked with such ease—more speech, not less speech, is the answer to the idiocy of these yahoos). I hope &lt;i&gt;New Scientist&lt;/i&gt; isn't going to be catering to the whims of popular, uninformed nervous nellies. That kind of timidity is not appropriate to a journal that has "Scientist" in its title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/come_on_new_scientist.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/qTxj09ocwgQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237129696555"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/crystal_jellies.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba5bb906eaaf06f3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology"/><title type="html">Crystal jellies.</title><published>2009-03-15T13:55:05Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T13:55:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/8lUschcwIDU/crystal_jellies.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/crystal_jellies.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the jellies we saw during our February visit to the &lt;a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/"&gt;Monterey Bay Aquarium&lt;/a&gt; is especially important to biologists.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, America has its pubs, bars, drinking houses and “dinner and dancing establishments” if you’re in Salt Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Australia is replete with what are called “clubs”.  Most of them are &lt;a href="http://www.rsl.org.au/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returned Services League&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;RSL&lt;/strong&gt;) clubs – these are clubs that commemorate military veterans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSL Clubs are a curious blend of bar, casino, cafe, restaurant and theater; where you can grab a beer, a coffee, or a meal, play the slots (&lt;em&gt;pokies&lt;/em&gt; as they’re known) and watch a &lt;a href="http://www.eziodeangelis.com.au/"&gt;psychic medium&lt;/a&gt; do bad cold readings, or a washed-up 80s band like &lt;a href="http://www.theradiators.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Radiators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; singing their one-hit wonder “You give me head” even though they’re well into their 50s…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…that is, you can do all of this as long as you’re not wearing a hat…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Club Dress Rules" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/dressrules.jpg?w=258&amp;amp;h=300" alt="Club Dress Rules" width="258" height="300"&gt;You see, RSL Clubs have a conservative dress code. Despite Australians’ fondness for casual dress, Australia is also fond of its bureaucracy, and its dress codes; school kids wear uniforms, staff wear uniforms, and to get into most clubs you must resist the urge to wear daring apparel such as shorts, baseball caps, ankle socks and overalls. If you disobey the rules (and didn’t even know the rules) you will be refused entry…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your clothing must be neat, clean and unrevealing. Mens’ shirts must be collared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once my brother tried to enter the &lt;a href="http://www.seaeagles.com.au/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manly Leagues Club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wearing a polo-neck shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have a collar,” the bouncer pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But it does have a collar,” my brother argued. “In fact, it has an &lt;em&gt;extra-long&lt;/em&gt; collar,” he said as he extended the rolled collar and tugged on it to show its length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bargaining was to no avail, and he was refused entry into the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it happened to me on Friday night…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to &lt;a href="http://www.dyrsl.com.au/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dee Why RSL Club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with my mates Duffy, Billy and Phil. I was greeted at the entrance by a doorman who asked for a membership card or ID. I compliantly showed my driver’s license, and everything seemed fine, until he suddenly looked down and announced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, I can’t let you in… You’re wearing thongs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Come now, Yanks… you know by now that &lt;em&gt;thongs&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;flip-flops&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;g-strings&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;em&gt;thongs&lt;/em&gt;. Okay, I was wearing a thong too, but most of you know that also…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doorman saw my confused look, grabbed a card of guidelines and pointed to a rule that read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No thongs after 8 PM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, &lt;em&gt;come on&lt;/em&gt;!” I scoffed, searching for counter-arguments. “I’m not barefoot. The thongs are clean. In fact, they’re expensive thongs, not cheap, tatty ones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sorry, that’s the rule,” he shrugged. “You can go home and change your shoes if you like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is there a manager around who could reconsider your decision?” I appealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="margin:5px" title="Footy scrum" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/football-scrum1.jpg?w=210&amp;amp;h=158" alt="Footy scrum" width="210" height="158"&gt;By now, a few other doormen had also appeared, all curious as to what was going down. A manager was phoned, and he soon arrived. Then they all just stood there, when somewhere else in the club someone was probably slipping date-rape drugs into some chick’s drink, or a few yobbos were starting a fight at the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I counted a total of six tall, burly, beefy Aussie blokes encircled around me. I felt like I was the football in the middle of a football &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)"&gt;scrum&lt;/a&gt;, except these guys were staring at my fucking shoes. I looked down at my offending feet, wiggling my red-painted toenails uncomfortably as these meat-heads decided the fate of my evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if on cue, another female guest arrives, shows her membership card and saunters on in – &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wearing thongs! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hang on a second, there’s an inconsistency” I twigged, suddenly filled with ammunition. “&lt;em&gt;She’s&lt;/em&gt; wearing thongs, but you allowed &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; in. Is that because she’s a member, and I’m not?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” said one of the muscular yet simple oafs, “&lt;em&gt;she’s&lt;/em&gt; wearing &lt;strong&gt;dress thongs&lt;/strong&gt;… but &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; wearing &lt;strong&gt;beach thongs&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(He was so dumb I just knew that he’d left out the apostrophe in “you’re”, even when he spoke…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…pause…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;? The fashion police? That is subjective!” I snapped at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you authorities on thongs? How do you differentiate between &lt;em&gt;dress thongs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;beach thongs&lt;/em&gt;?” I demanded as they all stood there, blinking stupidly at me. I pointed to their club rules and raised my voice, “Do the rules state acceptable materials or colors or designs that constitute some sort of thong taxonomy?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a stunned silence, until one of them asked with wide eyes, “Are you an English teacher?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I corrected him.  “I’m a semanticist and I once defined the word &lt;em&gt;walk&lt;/em&gt;,” I said firmly, realising how fucking peculiar that sounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued. “My point is, if you can’t clearly define the different types of thongs then you’re discriminating against my shoes!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager’s eyes flashed at the insinuation of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can come in, Miss,” he said politely, waving me in to the club grandly. And so I walked in, wearing my “beach thongs”…&lt;/p&gt;

As a child (and even as an adult), I loved lazily looking up at the clouds and envisioning animals, objects, and people in the clouds. That's why very early on in the history of this blog I started posting about pareidolia, starting with an &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/04/virgin-mary-appears.html"&gt;appearance of the Virgin Mary in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; under a freeway underpass for the Kennedy Expressway near where I used to live in the late 1990s, with my most recent installment having been a vision of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/best_pareidolia_ever.php"&gt;Virgin Mary with the Baby Jesus in a Lava Lamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/effectmeasure/2009/03/freethinker_sunday_sermonette_142.php"&gt;revere&lt;/a&gt;, however, I now have access to a retrospective of the best Christian pareidolia stories in the news for 2008. Man, oh, man, I never knew Jesus and Mary showed up in so many places in just one year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/JvjGIkl2yDY%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=500&amp;amp;height=405" width="500" height="405"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bow before the face of so much pareidolia goodness. I do, however, disagree with revere when he says, "But their stations keep shoveling it out. Because really stupid shit is OK if it's in the name of religion." Actually, "really stupid shit" is OK as long as news producers perceive it as being interesting to their audience--in other words, as &lt;em&gt;entertaining&lt;/em&gt;--and thus likely to improve ratiings, hence the continued proliferation of stories about ghosts, alleged sitings of Bigfoot, and, as I had some fun with about a year ago, even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_orbs_invade_the.php"&gt;orbs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pareidolia stories are perceived as fun, and TV news only uses such nonsense with a &lt;br&gt;
Christian basis because the pervasiveness of Judeo-Christian religion in our culture makes such images always among the most common ones that people are likely to impose on various objects and among the ones their viewers would be most interested in hearing about. If the U.S. were a completely atheist nation, people would see something else in potato chips, Lava Lamps, pieces of wood, dirty windows, and various other objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what, I wonder? Richard Dawkins? Charles Darwin?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/pareidolia_parade_2008.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/6gRHN90ougw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237122262162"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=519">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ed21b802d96a4ab4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Spiderman</title><published>2009-03-15T12:10:26Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T12:10:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=519" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love the local news. Actually, let me clarify that - I hate the local news. I hate it because the reporting tends to be a irritatingly low quality. They tend to grab the most sensational aspects of a story, and seem to follow a very limited number of predetermined scripts. It’s just horrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also love the local news because they offer an endless supply of misconceptions, urban legends, crank claims, and just plain nonsense for a skeptic to address. That reflects, I guess, the larger love-hate relationship that skpetics have with pseudoscience in general - we hate what it is, but it gives us something to do, and we have an endless fascination for the weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was sent this &lt;a href="http://cbs13.com/watercooler/Paraplegic.Man.Suffers.2.958151.html"&gt;shining example of terrible local news reporting&lt;/a&gt; (thanks to listener John Stewart for sending this in - and I’m assuming it’s not that John Stewart). The story that they tell is of a man who has been wheelchair-bound for 20 years following an accident, and then after a spider bite was able to walk again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds amazing (pun intended), right? Go ahead, read the story, watch the video, and then come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reporters missed the real story - an important story that might actually help some people. Instead they told a stupid story that can only serve to give false hope to the paralyzed and to confuse the public. The details of the real story are there - they had all the information they needed. If they just spent the time to speak with an expert, they could have put the story into its real context. Maybe they did speak to an expert, but didn’t get the story they wanted to tell, so they ignored it. I’ve seen that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the real story, as best as I can infer from the information I am given, but I have a high degree of confidence in my interpretation. First, it is not plausible that the spider bite itself did anything to regenerate nerves or muscles or improve David Blancarte’s neurological function. So what did happen. The story reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since, David’s been relying on his wheelchair to get around. Then the spider bite. A Brown Recluse sent him to the hospital, then to rehab for eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always important to seperate out variables when considering cause and effect. There are at least three variables we are being presented - Blancarte was biten by a brown recluse (which is poisonous), then he was treated for his bite in the hospital, and then he spent eight months in rehab. Of those three variables, which one is most likely to have resulted in his ability to walk? My bet is on the eight months of rehab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand this we must further separate out variables. Motor ability (like walking) results from two general categories of factors - neurological and functional. Neurological factors include things like how intact the spinal cord and nerves are, and is there any damage to specific parts of the brain. Functional factors include conditioning, training, and motivation. So the question we must always ask when someone makes an improvement in motor ability is: was their improvement neurological, functional, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that the assumption most people make is that all improvement in ability is neurological. But this is often not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case the most likely scenario is that Blancarte was severely, but incompletely, injured 20 years ago. He lost strength, sensation, and eventually most of his muscle mass in the lower extremities. For about 18 months following such an injury there may be genuine neurological recovery. After that further neurological recovery (for spinal and nerve injury) is unlikely. (The brain may continue to repair itself slowly for several years.) What often happens (and unfortunately this has a lot to do with economic resources) is that after the first few initial months of rehab, people are sent home or to a living situation and have inadequate follow up. They may be depressed, or hopeless that they will make further recovery. They adapt to life in a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their neurological recovery may not have been complete. They further slowly improve neurological function over the next year, but actually during this time they may lose function from disuse. Then 20 years later they are in the hospital for an unrelated medical issue (like a spider bite) and physical therapy is consulted (which is routine). The physical therapist figures out that the patient has more potential then they may realize, or they have just been inadequately treated in the past, and recommends another round of rehab. This rehab allows for further functional recovery (even in the absence of further neurological recovery), and not surprisingly the person improves their ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case it seems that Blancarte went from wheelchair-bound to being able to walk a little with braces and a walker. His legs are still clearly very atrophied, and it is possible that with further exercise he can gain some strength.This is the kind of marginal improvement we can see with rehab alone, and does not require an actual improvement in neurological function. We do not have to hypothesize some miraculous spider-bite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scenario is very common. The distinction between neurological and functional recovery is a critical one to anyone who wishes to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment designed to improve neurological function. The variable of undergoing rehabilitation must be controlled for. There is also the widely recognized “cheerleader effect”, which is essentially increased motivation leading to greater effort and therefore ability. If the variable of the specific treatment is not isolated from the functional variables, then any intervention may seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led to or supported a great deal of neurological pseudoscience. For example, dubious Chinese clinics promise “stem cell therapy” for spinal cord injury. This is almost certainly a cold-hearted con, but they rely upon some functional recovery in some cases to provide the anecdotes they need to sell their fake therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also investigated a number of bogus treatments for stroke - same deal. After sitting on a couch for 10 years following a stroke, with no motivation or hope, patients are sold a “miracle cure”, which motivates them to get off the couch and undergo the treatment - with some rehab thrown in. Of course they improve their ability - they went from being depressed and sitting on the couch all day to being motivated and undergoing rehab. The treatment itself is irrelevant, except for the money it extracts from the desperate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real story that the lazy reporters missed in this case is that there are many people who, following a neurological injury, have received insufficient rehab. Or perhaps they were initially treated properly, but have since not followed up and essentially given up on themselves. People with such injuries, or other neurological injuries like strokes, should make an effort to follow up with their doctors. There is also value in continuing physical therapy, even if it is just a regimen of home exercises, to maintain and perhaps even further improve motor ability. Some people also suffer a significant depression which saps their motivation, and treating that depression may be important.&lt;/p&gt;

At least, those are the commonest five-word sequences on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, in commenting on Geoff Pullum's "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1223#comments"&gt;Familiar six-word phrase or saying&lt;/a&gt;" post, I observed that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For five-word phrases, a version of the question "What five-word phrase occurs most often on Google?" can definitively be answered by reference to the &lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2006T13"&gt;Web 1T 5-gram corpus&lt;/a&gt;, created by researchers at Google, which contains English n-gram counts from about one trillion words of web text.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several readers asked me what the answer actually is.  The answer turned out to be not entirely trivial to get, and it may not be as interesting as you'd expect. Or maybe it's more interesting, I don't know. Anyhow, I live to serve, if not always at internet speeds, and the details are below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Web 1T 5-Gram Corpus&lt;/em&gt; contains all the length-five sequences of tokens occuring more than 40 times, from a sample of the web containing 1,024,908,267,229 tokens. I'll pass over in silence various minor technical difficulties associated with the fact that the corpus is 54 GB of text, stored in compressed form on five DVDs, and that it contains 1,176,470,663 5-grams, divided in alphabetical order into 118 files. It's a tribute to modern technology that I was nevertheless able to get to an answer, using only a laptop computer and a few minutes spared now and then from other activities.  (Of course, it's a much more significant tribute to modern technology that Thorsten Brants and Alex Franz were able to compile the corpus in the first place.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tokenization used in creating this corpus follows the tradition established by the Wall Street Journal portion of the &lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC99T42"&gt;Penn Treebank&lt;/a&gt;, which represents sentence boundaries as special tokens, and splits punctuation out as separate tokens as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the most-frequent 5-grams tend to be things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;- - - - -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which occurs 88,974,253 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we ignore sentence-boundary markers and punctuation (other than the apostrophes in things like "what's hot" and "you're looking for"), then the commonest 5-gram in the corpus is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;Send a private message to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which occurs        26,672,131 times. (Free tip: as far as amazon.com knows, there is no published book whose title includes the string &amp;quot;send a private message&amp;quot;…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the top-20 commonest sequences, with their counts, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See what I mean?  This is not really telling us anything about the state of the English language, and  what it's telling us about web culture is pretty limited.  (Though because of the overlapping 5-grams, we can also conclude that "are the property of their respective owners" is the commonest 7-word sequence on the web. If we care.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even looking down the list to strings that occur only about a million times, nearly everything is either boilerplate from commercial websites, or fragments of random lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously the 5-gram resource as a whole is not like this — the lower-frequency end of its n-gram lists is an invaluable aid to language modeling. But it&amp;#39;s inevitable, if you think about it, for things like eBay boilerplate to dominate the high-frequency end of the higher-order n-grams in a web snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happy that &amp;quot;Send a private message to&amp;quot; nosed out &amp;quot;property of their respective owners&amp;quot;. (Another free tip — there&amp;#39;s also no book entitled &amp;quot;Property of their respective owners&amp;quot;. Nor any album or band …) But neither one of these phrases strikes me as a plausible candidate for the real &amp;quot;commonest five word sequence in English&amp;quot;.  And because it&amp;#39;s harder to filter out commercial and legalistic boilerplate than to filter out punctuation, it&amp;#39;s not going to be easy to get a useful answer from a web snapshot of this kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be more meaningful to take counts from a balanced corpus like the BNC — though at a mere 100 million words, that&amp;#39;s 10,000 times smaller. This creates a different problem. Since a count of 1,000,000 in the 1T corpus translates to a count of 100 in the BNC,  it&amp;#39;s likely that the commonest real 5- and 6-word sequences will have low enough counts that the ordering is statistically unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I'm not sure why the 1T corpus slightly different counts for overlapping 5-grams that must be pretty much coextensive on the web, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;the property of their respective        24891265&lt;br&gt;
are the property of their       24938581&lt;br&gt;
property of their respective owners     25640531&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences are fairly small — in this case, around 3% — but it seems surpising to see even that much divergence associated with such near-zero-entropy string continuations. Perhaps this does reflect real differences in the frequency counts in the sampled corpus, but perhaps there is a technical reason having to do with approximations in the counting algorithm. I&amp;#39;ll see if I can find out. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Meanwhile, for those interested in the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1223"&gt;earlier discussion&lt;/a&gt; of that all-too-common six-word phrase "before turning the gun on himself", Fev at Headsup: The Blog has &lt;a href="http://headsuptheblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/that-six-word-phrase-again.html"&gt;something to add&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of a reference to Gaye Tuchman, "Objectivity as strategic ritual", &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Sociology&lt;/em&gt; 77:660-679, 1972. Fev supports rootlesscosmo's suggestion that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;recourse to boilerplate may actually help persuade editors and referees that the work meets professional standards; if a paper says "the animals were sacrificed" it's science, if it says "I killed the mice" it's macabre, though the event is the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by quoting Tuchman:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Attacked for a controversial presentation of 'facts,' newspapermen invoke their objectivity almost the way a Mediterranean peasant might wear a clove of garlic around his neck to ward off evil spirits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on journalistic objectivity rituals, see e.g. "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002263.html"&gt;Ritual questions, ritual answers&lt;/a&gt;", 6/25/2005; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002266.html"&gt;Down with journalists!&lt;/a&gt;", 6/27/2005; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002479.html"&gt;Ritual interviews&lt;/a&gt;", 9/18/2005.  Perhaps it's time for the anthropologists to devote more time to documenting the culture of journalists, who seem to be at least as endangered as Mediterranean peasants are. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237109210577"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/radio_reminder_52.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f8085dfb63106248</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Radio reminder</title><published>2009-03-15T07:31:34Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T07:31:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/9L0ULSMu6pQ/radio_reminder_52.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/radio_reminder_52.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got home at this absurdly late hour, after an exceptionally miserable long day of screwed-up air travel, but I'm still going to try to get up by 9a to listen to &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/content/view/298/1/"&gt;Atheists Talk radio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/radio_reminder_52.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/9L0ULSMu6pQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237105222893"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_233.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2bfde3d1ed07c15c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-03-15T09:16:05Z</published><updated>2009-03-15T09:16:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/i7XXRFfeaHk/clock_quotes_233.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_233.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time is a wealth of change, but the clock in its parody makes it mere change and no wealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The March 14th &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/index.ssf?/base/news-30/1237072751213820.xml&amp;amp;storylist=orlocal&amp;amp;thispage=1"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; reports that 18-year-old Henry Cozad is being charged with murder in the death of a 59-year-old woman who lived with his father. Cozad is said to have "severe autism." After an "attack" on special education teacher Tim Waits last year, Waits wrote in a victim's impact statement that "'In my personal opinion this student, had he grabbed anyone else, he most likely would have killed them.'" District Attorney R. Paul Frasier said that the "severity of Cozad's disability would play a role" regarding the charges brought against Cozad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a problem with prosecuting people with extreme mental issues because under the law you have to be competent to proceed. ... That basically means you need to be aware of the charges against you, and you have to be able to assist in your defense," Frasier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waits said that he "felt guilty he hadn't done more" and that he was "'afraid that something like this would happen.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the question that sends a thud in my stomach, and all the more after the recent death of Kent State University professor &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/its_just_too_close"&gt;Trudy Steuernagel&lt;/a&gt;, whose son Sky Walker is charged with killing her. The &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_criminal_justice_system_and_individuals_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;criminal justice system&lt;/a&gt; is, it's acknowledged by all, not prepared or able to handle cases involving individuals with developmental delays. So we need to do what we can before things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/newsflash/index.ssf?/base/news-30/1237072751213820.xml&amp;amp;storylist=orlocal&amp;amp;thispage=1"&gt;Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;, Waits had requested that Cozad be placed in a group home; Cozad was "kept away from othet students" at school, as the director of the South Coast Education Service District life skills program, Tenneal Wetherell, notes. Much as it's difficult and painful to consider the &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/violence_among_autistic_rare_expert_says"&gt;topic of violence&lt;/a&gt;, we need to talk about them, before tragedies happen.

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the National Science Foundation, there are over 2.5 million research workers worldwide, with more than 1.2 million in the U.S. alone.1 If we look at all the articles, reports, emails and conversations that pass between them, we could count billions of knowledge transactions every year. This incredible diffusion of knowledge is the very fabric of science.

&lt;p&gt;Given that the diffusion of knowledge is central to science, it behooves us to see if we can accelerate it.  We note that diffusion takes time. Sometimes it takes a long time. Every diffusion process has a speed. Our thesis is that speeding up diffusion will accelerate the advancement of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The millions of researchers are grouped into thousands of communities. A community may be defined as a group of researchers working on a single scientific problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web of Science indexes about 8,700 journals2, representing many different research communities. That's a lot of science to keep up with. Currently it is difficult for researchers, who primarily track journals within their specific discipline, to hear about discoveries made in distant scientific communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, diffusion across distant communities can take years. In contrast, within an individual scientific community, internal communication systems are normally quicker. These include journals, conferences, email groups, and other outlets that ease communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many communities use related methods and concepts: mathematics, instrumentation, and computer applications. Thus there is significant potential for diffusion ACROSS communities, including very distant communities. We see this as an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequential Diffusion is Too Slow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diffusion to distant communities takes a long time because it often proceeds sequentially, typically spreading from the community of origin (A) to a neighbor (B), then to community (C), a neighbor of B, and so on. This happens because neighboring communities are in fairly close contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science will progress faster if this diffusion lag time is diminished. The concept of global discovery is to transform this sequential diffusion process into a parallel process. This means that new knowledge flows directly to distant communities. The goal is to reduce the lag time from years to months and from months to days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling Knowledge Diffusion Suggests How to Accelerate It&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thinking about how to speed up diffusion across distant communities, we have looked at diffusion research, including computer modeling. We are particularly interested in recent work that applies models of disease dynamics to the spread of scientific ideas. The spread of new ideas in science is mathematically similar to the spread of disease, even though one produces positive results, the other negative. Our goal is to foster epidemics of new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might ask "Why is the math of disease related to the math of knowledge diffusion?" It is because neither involves considerations of conservation of mass. This makes disease and knowledge diffusion unlike many other kinds of diffusion that obey laws of conservation of mass. Consider, for example, diffusion of pollution. If pollution diffuses from point A to point B, point A now has less of it. But if knowledge diffuses from person X to person Y, person X still has what he started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working with a group of modelers led by Luis Bettencourt of Los Alamos National Laboratory.  They have written an important new paper, currently in press in Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, entitled: "The power of a good idea: quantitative modeling of the spread of ideas from epidemiological models."3 This paper applies a disease model to the spread of Feynman diagrams just after World War II. Feynman diagrams are a central method of analysis in particle physics.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/diffusion_of_knowledge.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/4W7It-ujTzY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237094064627"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/if_newspapers_die_investigativ.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f0e6bf356a64f115</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">If newspapers die, investigative reporting will die as well.

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the failure of many newspapers looms and public radio cuts its journalistic offerings, the complaint against new media by established journalists gets sharper and sharper. The key rallying cry is that new media can't provide investigative reporting, that it can only piggyback on the work of the mainstream print and radio media, and that when the newspapers go, there goes investigative work and all the civic value it provided. 

&lt;p&gt;As a starting point in a conversation about the future, this complaint is much more promising that complaining about how people on the Internet are really mean or stupid. It narrows the discussion down to a central function of journalism, the independent investigation of government, industry and society and the delivery of information from such investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that many of the journalists talking along these lines don't really mean to throw overboard all the other writing (and jobs supported by that writing) that appears within most major newspapers. But I'm going to take it that way: as a concession that much of the rest of the content of 20th Century newspapers is served either equivalently or better by online media. We don't need newspapers to have film criticism or editorial commentary or consumer analysis of automobiles or comic strips or want ads or public records. It might be that existing online provision of those kinds of information could use serious improvement or has issues of its own. It might be that older audiences don't know where to find some of that information, or have trouble consuming it in its online form. But there's nothing that makes published newspapers or radio programming inherently superior at providing any of those functions, and arguably many things that make them quite inferior to the potential usefulness of online media. So throw the columnists and the reviewers and the lifestyle reporters off the newspaper liferaft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If print journalists want to claim that their saving grace is independent, investigative journalism, they might want to clean house a bit first, because a substantial amount of print journalism doesn't really live up to that ideal. Getting fed information by a confidential source inside an Administration or inside a business who is using the reporter either to kick a rival in the teeth or as part of a coordinated scheme to float a trial balloon about a hypothetical decision is not independent investigative reporting. It's a collusive agreement to serve as an unpaid assistant to the public-relations staff of a government or business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2009/03/help-scientists.html" title=""&gt;Help scientists track plant and animal cycles&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The USA-National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) -- a University of Arizona, Tucson-based group of scientists and citizens that monitors the seasonal cycles of plants and animals -- is calling for volunteers to help track the effect of climate change on the environment.

&lt;p&gt;The group is launching a national program encouraging citizen volunteers to observe seasonal changes among plants and animals, like flowering, migration and egg-laying. They can then log in and record their observations online at the USA-NPN website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The program is designed for people interested in participating in climate change science, not just reading about it," said Jake Weltzin, executive director of the USA-NPN and a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phenology is the study of the climate's influence on animal and plant life cycles. Climate change can affect these cyclical patterns and put certain species of plants and animals in danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a large volunteer base to help track these changes enables researchers to predict the effects of global climate change on plants, animals and ecosystems, said Mark D. Schwartz, chair of the USA-NPN board of directors. The data can be used to predict wildfires, droughts and pollen production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If interested, go to &lt;a href="http://www.usanpn.org/" title=""&gt;USA National Phenology Network&lt;/a&gt; to sign up and participate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The USA National Phenology Network brings together citizen scientists, government agencies, non-profit groups, educators and students of all ages to monitor the impacts of climate change on plants and animals in the United States. The network harnesses the power of people and the Internet to collect and share information, providing researchers with far more data than they could collect alone.

&lt;p&gt;---------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are looking for volunteers to help us monitor some 200 plant species found across the United States. This effort will eventually expand to include animals and physical phenomena, such as bird migrations and ice out on ponds. Please explore our website to learn more about USA-NPN.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uncleweed/118470406/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/43/118470406_f57a7794f5_m.jpg" alt="in the top left is a bowl of unidentifiable food with a spoon in it, the rest of the image is a wooden table.  written and circled are the words education, inspiration, empathy, cooperation" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/03/08/angelmaker0308bk.html"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of a book called &lt;em&gt;The Angel Maker&lt;/em&gt; says of a character, "He has Asperger’s syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. He lacks empathy..." The review goes on to use phrases such as "empathy deficit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/can_a_dvd_teach_emotions"&gt;Kristina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/considering_visual_processing_in_reading_emotions"&gt;I blogged&lt;/a&gt; about the "Transporters" video that is supposed to "teach emotions"--the implication being that "emotions" are what needs to be "taught."  (Regarding the unfortunately worded headline in the change.org newsletter, I apologize and have done what I can make sure a similar thing does not happen again.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was interviewed about a paper which used autism/empathy as opposite ends of the same spectrum in a discussion of Sarte/Camus.  In searching for a link to the paper, I found something much better to share: Donna Williams was also interviewed and &lt;a href="http://blog.donnawilliams.net/2009/03/05/autism-autistic-empathy-and-jean-paul-sartre/"&gt;posted her answers on her blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Williams' answers are so well put they nearly make my post here moot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's become a given in popular culture that autism "means" a person lacks empathy and emotions.  But this idea is not present in the actual definition of autism, and neither is it universally accepted by autism researchers nor is it consistent with the first hand experiences of autistic individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autism" as a descriptive word "means" a set of observable behaviors defined by &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/overview_diagnostic_criteria.htm"&gt;DSM criteria&lt;/a&gt;, which says nothing at all about the reasons why a person is exhibiting those behaviors.  Neither does the definition include anything about a person's core capacity for emotion, caring, or empathy.  Assumptions about what's going on inside based on what is observed on the outside can lead to &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/mental_models_observable_behavior_and_disability"&gt;mistaken impressions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atypical social interaction does not "mean" lack of empathy or emotions any more than lack of social imitation "means" &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/creativity_daydreaming_and_imaginative_play"&gt;lack of creativity or imagination&lt;/a&gt;.  There are a huge number of reasons why social interaction may be atypical.  It may be from &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/keepon_the_robot_interacts_without_the_overload"&gt;lack of being able to process social information on a sensory level&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_autistic_modules.pdf"&gt;difficulty with language&lt;/a&gt;, or from being &lt;a href="http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Gernsbacher_EarlyOral-Manual.pdf"&gt;unable to move with volition&lt;/a&gt; in response to a social prompt, or from a vast pool of other reasons including a personality disorder that affects empathy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Sinclair addresses empathy from a first-person perspective in the essay &lt;a href="http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/empathy.htm"&gt;Thoughts About Empathy&lt;/a&gt;.   Sinclair also writes about the empathy issue in &lt;a href="http://web.syr.edu/~jisincla/bridging.htm"&gt;Bridging the Gaps: An Inside-Out View of Autism&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Even when I could find words, no one believed me.  I was told that I was only pretending to feel pain, fear, confusion, or whatever I was reporting because I really felt whatever the therapist's preferred theory predicted I should feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And through all this condescending concern about feelings and emotional issues, no one ever bothered to explain to me what the words meant!  No one ever told me that they expected to see feelings on my face, or that it confused them when I used words without showing corresponding expressions.  No one explained what the signals were or how to use them.  They simply assumed that if &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; could not &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; my feelings, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; could not &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; them.  I think this shows a serious lack of perspective-taking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn Prince Hughes writes in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Songs-Gorilla-Nation-Journey-Through/dp/1400050588"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Songs of the Gorilla Nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people, again lay and professional alike, believe that all people with autism are by definition incapable of communicating, that they do not experience emotions, and that they cannot care about other people or the world around them.  My experience, both personally and with others like me, is that in many cases quite the opposite is true.  A significant number of autistic people who care deeply about all manner of things, and are profoundly emotional about them, share these capabilities in the privacy of their journals, diaries, and poetry.  They do not show them to the world, which is too intense and often too destructive, or, worse, dismissive.  They do not show them to professionals, whose beliefs about the abilities of autistic people and the power they wield over their clients sometimes make them too frightening to challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea that autistic people generally, globally don't have empathy or emotions can lead both directly and indirectly to horrific human rights issues.  Such as an "autism expert" telling a room of teachers not to worry about autistic students being bullied because the autistic students won't be emotionally affected by bullying.  Bullying is known to lead to depression, anxiety, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/ben_x_and_bullying"&gt;and suicide&lt;/a&gt; in autistic people and is a serious, serious health and safety issue.  That's just one example, and hardly the most shocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blanket generalizations about a minority population's capacity for human emotion have consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237066615867"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/my-son-still-insists-on-callin/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a7983d6b2c4e7c3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">my son still insists on callin…</title><published>2009-03-14T21:21:42Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T21:21:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/my-son-still-insists-on-callin/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;my son still insists on calling Canada’s favourite sport “honky”, may just give up trying to correct it&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237064257332"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/14/pareidolia-to-go/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/385c5df6fc43882a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Pareidolia"/><title type="html">Pareidolia to go</title><published>2009-03-14T20:34:39Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T20:34:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/14/pareidolia-to-go/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been getting email about lots of pareidolia on the web…&lt;/p&gt;

Prof. Eugene Volokh, a First Amendment expert, &lt;a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2009_03_08-2009_03_14.shtml#1236961987" rel="external "&gt;has some comments here.&lt;/a&gt; Personally, I’m very skeptical about the news report. Legal reporting is often extremely misleading, and it’s always best to be skeptical. In this case, the story only quotes the mother (who, of course, lost the case and is the one complaining) and not the judge. The mother claims that the judge based his ruling in part on this issue, but we don’t have the judge’s own words before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting that aside, this is not an easy question to call. Of course, the prospect of a judge basing a custody decision solely on this issue is very troubling–there are far more relevant factors in a custody case than whether a child is receiving adequate science instruction. And a parent has a right to direct the religious upbringing of a child, including the right to teach a child ludicrous religious dogma instead of science. That’s a sad thing, but people often think other people’s exercise of freedom is a waste. Certainly history includes many atrocious cases in which atheist parents have lost their children because judges thought it was “better for the child” to be taught religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the father also has a right to educate his children, and if he thinks the children are not being instructed adequately, he has a legitimate complaint. There are good reasons to be concerned about the quality of education in home schooling environments (although there are certainly many very high quality home schoolers). In a case like this, it is probably best to ensure that although the mother is free to teach her children her religious beliefs, the father is also free to teach real science to kids if he chooses. But, again, we don’t know all the facts, or even the other side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think everyone can at least agree that child custody cases are extremely complicated matters–which cannot be accurately described in a brief news story, and obviously should not be decided on the basis of evolution or creationism education alone–and that except in cases of actual abuse, minor children should not be taken from parents because of the religious instruction that parents are giving their kids. The problem is, when does religious instruction become abuse? That line can often be blurry–but if it’s just a dispute over evolution and creationism, it’s clearly not abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, kindof a NASA launch pad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.launchpadworkshop.org/"&gt;Launch Pad in this case is a workshop for established writers&lt;/a&gt;, giving them an immersed environment where they can learn the science of astronomy. As the website says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.launchpadworkshop.org/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/launchpad.jpg" alt="Launch Pad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launch Pad is a free, NASA-funded workshop for established writers held in beautiful high-altitude Laramie, Wyoming. Launch Pad aims to provide a “crash course” for twelve attendees in modern astronomy science through workshops, guest lectures, and observation through the University of Wyoming’s two large telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s run by science fiction author and professional astronomer Mike Brotherton, and it’ll be held this year from July 14 - 21. The special lecturer is Joe Haldeman. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/15/the-forever-movie/"&gt;Yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Joe Haldeman&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be there too, probably later in the week (I have to be in Vegas for &lt;a href="http://www.amazingmeeting.com"&gt;TAM 7&lt;/a&gt; the week before). But I’ll be doing some &lt;em&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/em&gt; talks, probably about asteroid impacts and black holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately &lt;a href="http://www.launchpadworkshop.org/apply.html"&gt;the deadline for applications to attend is tomorrow, March 15&lt;/a&gt;, so hurry! If you’re a professional writer, then you want this. Since it’s funded by NASA, the costs to attendees are minimal, too!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237051453414"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/14/slamming-uk-antiscience/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/11d575d841cf8335</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Slamming UK antiscience</title><published>2009-03-14T16:28:58Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T16:28:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/14/slamming-uk-antiscience/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about one of my heroes, Ben Goldacre, before: he writes &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;the Bad Science column for the UK newspaper The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, and is a tireless fighter against medical nonsense like vitamins curing AIDS, homeopathy, and chiropractic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s in some hot water right now. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/06/uk-in-trouble-measles-antivax-garbage-on-the-rise/"&gt;As I mentioned in February&lt;/a&gt;, a &amp;quot;journalist&amp;quot; named Jeni Barnett, who went on the radio and basically spewed dangerous antivax nonsense for an hour. Ben posted the entire audio clip, and predictably the radio station asked him to take it down. In America, given copyright restrictions, that would be understandable, but in the UK the laws are different, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/lbc-mmr-jeni-barnett-an-early-day-motion-the-times-and-er-a-bit-of-stephen-fry/#more-894"&gt;and the legality of this is questionable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I don’t understand is the radio station’s steadfast defense for themselves in their right to air fearmongering conspiracy theories which spend a lot of air time telling parents it’s better to put their kids at serious risk of fatal diseases than to get a simple vaccination, and to air someone saying demonstrably incorrect things while doing it. Where does personal or company pride end when it puts little children at risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben created an excellent short video news segment &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfheO9H8CD4"&gt;which is now on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. I strongly urge everyone to watch it and spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, Andrew Breitbart on Real Time last night, and in a &lt;a href="http://www.frcblog.com/2009/03/perkins_on_point_tony_perkins.html"&gt;video from (liar for Jesus) Tony Perkins&lt;/a&gt; of the Family Research Council, I've heard about how adult stem cells have cured or treated 72 diseases.  Oh and embryonic stem cells, they've cured none.  It's been a while since we've seen this &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/05/adult_stem_cell_nonsense.php"&gt;adult stem cell nonsense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to jog my memory for a minute, I knew this was a lie, but it had been so long since I heard it, that I really had to think about where I had heard it from.  Oh yeah, &lt;a href="http://www.stemcellresearch.org/facts/treatments.htm"&gt;this nonsense list&lt;/a&gt; that was famously &lt;a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/In_new_book_Coulter_cribs_stem_0614.html"&gt;cribbed by Ann Coulter&lt;/a&gt; from a right-to-life group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand the problem with this list and why these citations don't say what they think they say, we have to learn a little bit about adult stem cells and a big scary word - transdifferentiation.  Adult stem cells, which exist in many tissues throughout your body, have specific jobs to perform for the human body to continue to function.  Hematopoietic (blood) stem cells make all the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets you need to as they are continuously lost or degenerating as part of their natural life span.  Stem cells in your gut continuously replace the lining of your intestines as it wears down from the harsh process of breaking down food.  There are stem cells that have been isolated from most tissues that function as a repair and maintenance pool of cells to keep our organs functional.  Not all organs have a ready pool of stem cells, and most stem cell populations, with the notable exception of blood stem cells, are hard to harvest without risking injury to the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while these cells are great at doing their job, the issue with adult stem cell research is, can they do another stem cell's job?  That is, instead of making just blood, could a hematopoietic stem cell make, say, an insulin secreting pancreatic cell?  The answer, despite some initial promising results around 2001, is no.  While hematopoietic stem cells may be able to make some other mesenchyme or connective tissue cells from the mesodermal germ layer, it doesn't appear that we can make such adult stem cells transdifferentiate - or make a type of cell from another embryonic germ layer.  This ability is what is meant by totipotency.  The ability to differentiate not just into one of the three major tissue types (mesoderm, ectoderm and endoderm), but all three of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is up with this list then?  They have 72 treatments using adult stem cells!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No they don't.  This is a lie.  They really only are describing one treatment in most of these list items.  That is, hematopoietic stem cell replacement of marrow being used in the &lt;i&gt;course&lt;/i&gt; of treatment of many diseases.  The hematopoietic stem cells are not treating these illnesses, they're letting us use chemo, or irradiation, and then replenishing the patient's blood supply.  In other words, they're doing what a good blood stem cell does, replace blood.  They're not treating the disease at all.&lt;/p&gt;

In clear sky conditions (no clouds), this is related mainly to the amount of aerosols (particulate matter) in the air (but is slightly dependent on the amount of water vapour as well, which is corrected for in this study). The authors report that the clear-sky visibility has decreased almost everywhere (particularly in Asia) from 1973 to 2007, with the exception of Europe where visibility has increased (consistent with the 'brightening trend' &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13740-clearing-smog-reveals-true-extent-of-global-warming.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; recently). Trends in North American stations seem relatively flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another story that didn't get as much press when it came out late last year but that is highly relevant to this issue - whether any of the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/sports/olympics/01china.html?ref=science"&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; that the Chinese authorities to reduce air pollution ahead of the Olympics last year had any impact. To the extent that they did, they might point the way to reducing aerosols and other pollutants across Asia, but it might also reveal how hard it is to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://newswire.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/behold.pl?ascribeid=20090312.080827&amp;amp;time=11%2000%20PDT&amp;amp;year=2009&amp;amp;public=0"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; and abstract for the Science paper link their results to the 'global dimming' trends we have &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/index/#Aerosols"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on in the past, but it's worth perhaps pointing out that previous studies (and the term 'global dimming" itself) have referred to all-sky conditions. So that includes changes in clouds - which are obviously a big factor in how much sunlight gets to the surface. Looking at the clear sky conditions (i.e. only when there are no clouds) can help attribute changes to aerosols or atmospheric dynamics say, but since aerosols affect clouds (the &lt;a href="http://www.igac.noaa.gov/newsletter/23/noone.php"&gt;'indirect effect'&lt;/a&gt;) as well as circulation too, it is only a partial estimate of the true impact of aerosols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting back to the Olympics…. Monitoring of pollutants near the surface has improved enormously in recent years with the various satellite instruments now in orbit (MOPITT, GOME, OMI and TES for instance (sounds like a comedy revue team, no?)). These instruments detect specific frequencies where pollutants are known to absorb and so can give a birds eye view of where the pollutants are and how they are changing. Among other things, the satellites can detect ozone, NOx, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the total amount of aerosols and carbon monoxide. Each of these have different atmospheric lifetimes and so can be used either to detect point sources (from pollutants that only last a short time) or long range transports of pollution (from the longer lived pollutants). NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (a big component of NOx - which lumps together &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOx#Definition_of_NOx.2C_NOy.2C_NOz_in_atmospheric_chemistry"&gt;NO and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;del&gt;all of the reactive nitrogen oxides&lt;/del&gt;), is very short-lived and so tells you a lot about local sources. Carbon monoxide has a longer lifetime (a couple of months) and so can show the long-range impacts.  Many of these pollutants have related industrial sources (car exhausts, coal burning, industrial production etc) and so can be used as proxies for many other pollutants (such as specific aerosols) which can't (yet) be directly measured.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do the results show? The team at GSFC have released preliminary images from the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; analysis showing the before and during the pollution controls. In both images, Beijing shows up as a huge hotspot of pollution, but relatively, the levels during the Olympics were significantly smaller:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/297373main_beijing0507_HI.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/297372main_beijing0507_226.jpg" align="left" width="40%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/297375main_beijing08_HI.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/297374main_beijing08_226.jpg" width="40%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August 2008 levels were therefore about 50% less than a similar period the year before. Meanwhile values at other hotspots in China were steady or got even worse. So there was a significant effect, but the scale of the task was indeed Olympian.&lt;/p&gt;

It was &lt;a href="http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2009_03_08-2009_03_14.shtml#1236689172"&gt;introduced to the world&lt;/a&gt; by David Bernstein on the Volokh Conspiracy, March 10, 2009.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Closetool1.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese original for "Closestool Burst Destructor" is MA3TONG3 BAO4ZHA4 QI4, which might better be translated as "Device for Blowing up Toilets."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gianni Wan helped me discover the answer by sending &lt;a href="http://detail.china.alibaba.com/buyer/offerdetail/21921684.html"&gt;this product description&lt;/a&gt; which apparently shows the front of the package that appeared on the Volokh Conspiracy (note the shape of the slot for hanging the package on a sales rack):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Closetool2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The note beneath the picture (and in larger characters at the top of the page in the orange bar) tells us that this is a "fun toy for blowing up toilets" whose purpose is to ZHENG3REN2 ("fix people").  Apparently, tricking people by blowing up their toilet is popular in China (Gianni remembers people doing it to each other when he was younger), but didn't catch on very well in the United States, so the manufacturer had to send his excess inventory to Israel where Bernstein photographed the back of the package pictured above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, Victor Steinbok had written to me several months ago asking about the name of a product he had encountered in Maryland, if I remember correctly.  Although the item was mysteriously called a "Closestool Brush," it looked like nothing more than a toilet brush.  A quick search of the Web revealed that "closestool brush" has become more or less standard for toilet brushes made in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of synonyms and euphemisms for "toilet" in English that are still current (e.g., commode, crapper, potty, throne, stool, can, john), so it is passing wondrous that the Chinese would have settled upon "closestool" as the ubiquitous mercantile translation for MA3TONG3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I do not want to be responsible this time for determining which translation software has enshrined the arcane term "closestool" as the default translation for toilet in China these days.  Instead, I will just point out some of the curious facts about the word "closestool" that I have dug up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merriam-Webster informs us that "&lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/closestool"&gt;closestool&lt;/a&gt;" dates to the 15th c. and means "a stool holding a chamber pot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere  we find that the "&lt;a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/close-stool"&gt;closestool&lt;/a&gt;" is "A utensil to hold a chamber vessel, for the use of the sick and infirm. It is usually in the form of a box, with a seat and tight cover."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More delightful details and a charming picture are to be found &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easing_stool"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most intriguing historical datum about the closestool that I found during my investigations is &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/close-stool"&gt;this bizarre sentence&lt;/a&gt; by John Florio (in 1603), translating Michel de Montaigne, Essays, Folio Society 2006, p. 17:  &amp;quot;other Princes, […] to dispatch their weightiest affaires make often their close stoole, their regall Throne or Councel-chamber….&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTW, the English plumber and businessman, Thomas Crapper (1836-1910), contrary to proper opinion, &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/business/names/crapper.asp"&gt;did not invent the flush toilet&lt;/a&gt;, and his name probably played no role in the development of defecation-related slang. According to the OED, the noun &lt;i&gt;crap&lt;/i&gt; was in use since 1490 to mean "The residue formed in rendering, boiling, or melting fat", and since the 19th century  "coarse slang" for "excrement" or "rubbish". The  verb &lt;i&gt;crap&lt;/i&gt; meaning "defecate" is first cited from 1846, and the slang term &lt;i&gt;crapper&lt;/i&gt; for "toilet" was first spotted in the U.S. in the early 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1237040075575"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_purpose_of_purpose.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e84db9ffe91d9fb9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The Purpose of Purpose</title><published>2009-03-14T14:41:10Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T14:41:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/uT_9ovo0YnU/the_purpose_of_purpose.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_purpose_of_purpose.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s another long travel day for me, I&amp;#39;m afraid, and this after a long night of trying to keep up with a lively mob of 20 and 30 year olds at a bar in Champaign-Urbana (and giving a talk yesterday that I think went over fairly well — I even had &lt;i&gt;protesters&lt;/i&gt; outside!

We've never given too much thought to what the places we've lived have looked like. &lt;em&gt;Location, location, location&lt;/em&gt;---based on what school districts had the most appropriate program for Charlie---has determined our choices, and we've rented whatever apartment or condo was available (and not on a main thoroughfare). Our current abode has super easy access to get onto the highway that takes me (after getting on a few other roads and crossing a river) to Jersey City. We're on the second floor and can see Zero of what's going on in the parking lot which is not so good, as that's where the bus picks up Charlie. Also (as &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/trying-to-be-pretty-good-neighbors/"&gt;previously noted&lt;/a&gt;), being as we are on the second floor, and being as Charlie is a very active 11 and three-quarters year old (and was a very active 10 year old when moved in), the amount of thumping, stomping and (ahem) banging generated by our household has not been very pleasing (understandably) to our &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/trying-to-be-pretty-good-neighbors/"&gt;downstairs neighbor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan definitely to move to another place in our school district by the end of the summer and the only requirements are: (1) first floor; (2) window with clear visibility of parking lot and outside.  The rest is, as they say, gravy (though I would like still to have the easy highway access---every minute counts when rushing off to work or rushing home to meet the yellow schoolbus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not really sure what our "ideal house" would look like, but these are a few thoughts: (1) A good-enough-sized yard in the front---Charlie has never been one to hang in the contained (safely fenced-in) space of backyard; he wants to be, it seems, where the action is. (2) A big open space: The three of us all tend to migrate into the part of the house and Charlie likes to be able to &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/autismland/3127531560/"&gt;lay out his stuff&lt;/a&gt; (and Jim and I can certainly use the rest of the real estate to spread out papers, file folders of papers, Charlie-documents (educational/medical/insurance/legal), books, more papers). We tend to leave our car outside so a garage is no big deal (and I have a visual space processing problem which has led to me shear the rear view mirror off more than one car) (on the driver &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the passenger side).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a garage would have been a bit more important: Charlie, aged younger, had a notable fascination with garage doors, especially automatic ones, requiring the press of a button. When we lived with my in-laws a few years ago, we were in the lower floor of their split-level, right next to their three-car garage (which usually only had one car in it). Charlie had three doors to work and watch opening and closing. Maybe it was too much a good thing, as he was nonchalant about the whole set-up after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I rather suspect &lt;a href="http://thirtythirtytwo.blogspot.com/2009/01/winter-projects.html"&gt;this fantasy use of a driveway&lt;/a&gt;----as an aquarium---would more than appeal to my water-loving boy.

And although it’s still science fiction, researchers may be in the early stages of making it science reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demis Hassabis and Professor Eleanor Maguire at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at UCL (University College London) have previously studied the role of a small area of the brain known as the hippocampus which is crucial for navigation, memory recall and imagining future events. Now, the researchers have shown how the hippocampus records memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still far from this application being possible but it’s amazing to think that this may very well be a reality one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the letter, we pointed out that pharmacies sell a growing number of products for which there is little or no scientific evidence of efficacy. Calling them “alternative” does not make them work. Examples include homeopathic preparations, magnetic pain relief devices, detox programmes, dodgy weight loss products and ear candles. Such products commonly appear in a “Natural Medicine” section of pharmacies but are sometimes displayed alongside real medicines whose benefits are scientifically proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to ear candles, we cited peer reviewed studies reporting serious injuries from ear candles, including temporary hearing loss, burns, ear canals blocked by dripping wax and punctured ear drums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Ear candling is one of those CAM modalities that clearly does more harm than good… its mechanism of action is first implausible and second, demonstrably wrong… in my view, therefore, it should be banned.” Edzard Ersnt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were very pleased to see our open letter was picked up by&lt;a href="http://www.medindia.net/news/Australian-Medical-Activists-Call-Upon-Pharmacists-to-Stop-Selling-Ear-Candles-48481-1.htm"&gt; medindia.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a link to the full letter &lt;a href="http://skeptics.com.au/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you also to our friend Lorreta Maron who got the letter posted on a pharmacists’ website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dating method developed by a Purdue University researcher allowed a more accurate determination of the age of the Zhoukoudian, China, site of remains of Homo erectus, commonly known as “Peking Man.” The site was found to be 680,000-780,000 years old. Earlier estimates put the age at 230,000-500,000 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those who are counting, that’s 674,000-774,000 years older than the existence of the entire universe, according to Young Earth Creationists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the support of the National Institutes of Health, the Arnolds and their team have been able to take a piece of HIV that is involved with helping the virus enter cells, put it on the surface of a common cold virus, and then immunize animals with it.

&lt;p&gt;It will indeed be interesting to see how HIV Deniers spin this. Though I’m sure those who believe “Big Pharma” has had the cure all along will no doubt just write this story off as merely waving the hope of an eventual vaccine in front of people so they don’t ask any questions with still no intent of releasing the cure they allegedly already have. And I’m sure the really fanatical anti-vaccine crowd who argue that vaccines are not effective for anything and are just placebos will similarly reject the very premise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the comments on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/neurotopia/2009/03/announcing_the_guest_editor_fo.php" title=""&gt;Sci's post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/announcing_the_guest_editor_fo.php" title=""&gt;my post&lt;/a&gt; (as well as some chatter I picked up on Twitter/Facebook/FriendFeed and privately), the pick for the 2009 editor is a Big Hit! I am truly looking forward to the year of collaboration with SciCurious on the next edition of the anthology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as you know, the anthology is a collaborative project of the entire science blogosphere. Thus, we need to get started! That means YOU!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to go into your blog's archives and look at your posts since December 1st 2008. Pick one or two or several that you think are the best, that you like the most, that you think are the easiest to transform from the online medium to the print medium (e.g., those not too heavily dependent on multimedia, videos, podcasts, copyrighted images, lots of links, etc.). Choose essays, poems, cartoons, comic strips, original art. Then submit that using &lt;a href="http://openlab.wufoo.com/forms/submission-form/" title=""&gt;this submission form&lt;/a&gt;. That is the only way to submit entries for the next year - posting comments here or blogging about it does not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are done with your own archives (and yes, start with your own as nobody knows your stuff as well as you do, or understands which posts are you most proud of - or least embarassed of - than you do), move on to other blogs, your favourite reads, hopefully including as many as possible new and not-as-well-known blogs in that number.  Pick some of their posts and submit them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, spread the word around the Web about this - point people to the submission form from wherever you think is appropriate: your blog, twitter, Facebook, various forums, etc. Let other science bloggers know about this - more the merrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd also like for someone to volunteer to design buttons (and provide easy-to-copy-and-paste codes) for submitting entries, something that people can put on sidebars of their blogs to always have handy throughout the year. Contact me if you want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did the previous three years, I will occasionally post the links to entries submitted so far, to avoid too many duplicates as well as to give you ideas and motivation to find and submit more stuff. I will start today as we already have these seven entries:&lt;/p&gt;

So then &lt;a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=220510&amp;amp;title=basic-cable-personality-clash"&gt;Stewart responded&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partial body and skull of the woman showed her jaw forced open by a brick (above)—an exorcism technique used on suspected vampires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belief in vampires was rampant in the Middle Ages, mostly because the process of decomposition was not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article goes into a little bit of detail as to how this came to be a popular belief and what other beliefs they had about vampires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/41536/title/Single_top_quark_detected"&gt;the five-sigma observation of single top quark production in both CDF and D0&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive_2009/today09-03-12.html"&gt;a new measurement of the W boson mass from the D0 collaboration&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/Higgs-mass-constraints-20090313.html"&gt;a new combined result from CDF and D0 on the search for the Higgs boson&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some level the first two have a bearing on the last one, which has started to get some attention in the media, including a nice &lt;a href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/200903131"&gt;interview with Prof. Heidi Schellman&lt;/a&gt; from Northwestern today on Science Friday, and a &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=higgs-constraints-fermilab-tevatron"&gt;piece in Scientific American&lt;/a&gt; to which I contributed quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation of the production of single top quarks (rather than the easier-to-see production of top-antitop quark pairs) has been a goal of the Tevatron experiments for years.  The success of this analysis demonstrates that extremely complex dissections of the data like this can be undertaken, and reveal faint signals like that of single top.  The search for the Higgs boson is more difficult still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is the race for the Higgs boson heating up?  Is there a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7893689.stm"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; at all?  Can the Tevatron see it before the LHC, given that the LHC has been &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/02/09/lhc-2009-restart/"&gt;delayed a year&lt;/a&gt; due to the quench incident last September?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all hinges on the mass of the Higgs boson.  In different mass ranges it decays to different final states, changing the experimental approach and changing the sensitivity of the Tevatron and LHC experiments.   The new measurement of the W mass by D0 adds a bit more knowledge about what the Higgs boson mass might be, since it depends on the mass of the W boson (the carrier of the weak force, which governs nuclear beta decay) and the mass of the top quark directly.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/mw-mtop-s08-explained.gif" title="mw-mtop-s08-explained.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/mw-mtop-s08.gif" alt="mw-mtop-s08.gif" width="250" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot at left demonstrates where we are right now; click on it for an annotated version.  I call it the “billion dollar plot” but it probably cost a lot more than that to produce, because it shows the results of decades of experimentation at the Tevatron at Fermilab, LEP at CERN, the SLC at SLAC, and other measurements.  As you can see (I hope) we are in a very interesting situation: the world’s data seem to indicate that the best Higgs boson mass is deep into the territory already excluded by LEP 2 in 2000!  They set a 95% confidence bound on the Higgs mass at about 114 GeV.  Their limit does not extend very far beyond that mass at all; it was limited by the energy of the LEP accelerator.  The mass range above 114 GeV is open experimentally, but if you take the W mass/top mass constraint seriously (in the context of the Standard Model you must) then it would certainly appear very likely that  the Higgs must lie in the range 114-185 GeV, with a strong preference for the lower end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/higgsgraph_031309.jpg" title="higgsgraph_031309.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/higgsgraph_031309.jpg" width="400" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Tevatron result takes a new bite out of the upper end of the range, excluding from 160-170 GeV the “sweet spot” where the Higgs can decay to two W bosons.  This is in some sense “first blood” for the Tevatron: at last the two experiments can exclude a Standard Model Higgs boson somewhere it hasn’t already been excluded!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, to my mind, the interesting end of the range is at the low end.  The data favor it, and theory favors it in the sense that if nature is more complicated, and supersymmetry is manifest, then one would expect that the light Higgs boson in supersymmetry exists in the range 120-130 GeV or so.    In this picture there would be heavier Higgs bosons lying in wait for either the LHC or the Tevatron, though the LHC has the edge here with higher energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the improvements in the analyses continue to outpace the data, as shown in the plot below, it is not impossible that the Tevatron could start to extend the region excluded by LEP, by this summer.  But discovery?  A three sigma result is possible with a good deal more data, but a five-sigma discovery looks very hard, and &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0010338"&gt;always has.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/projections.gif" title="projections.gif"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/files/2009/03/projections.gif" alt="projections.gif" width="250"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a gold-plated, five-sigma-significance discovery, my money is on the LHC, I have to say.  But the LHC will initially see the Higgs boson decaying to two photons, and we really need to see it decaying to two quarks or two leptons to really know its nature.  I think the Tevatron could do that before the LHC, measuring the decay of the Higgs boson to two b quarks, and that alone is reason enough to keep the machine running until it does, to my mind, provided there are sufficient personnel to run the detectors and analyze the data.   That decision, though, is above my pay grade…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LHC will likely be able to see the Higgs boson decaying to two tau leptons before the Tevatron can see it decaying to two b quarks.  Is that a race?  I view the two observations as complementary, and they both add to the scientific picture.  Without the Tevatron, it will just take longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last word…the Higgs boson is damned hard to see, and when the LHC turns on, a ton of other new physics may pour out first.  It is a very interesting year, that’s for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

Seriously. Not only that but 8 percent believe in them outright and 3 percent claim to have encountered one personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is said to find these &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulduf%C3%B3lk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;huldufólk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; or hidden folk is through psychic powers. And only those born with the power can find them. Obviously, duh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find elves, seers don’t really need to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; anything—they’ll just sense an elfin presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, it gets better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;huldufólk&lt;/em&gt; are thought to live in another dimension, invisible to most. They build their homes inside rocks and on craggy hillsides, and they seem to favor lava formations. The port town of Hafnarfjördur, near &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk"&gt;Reykjavík&lt;/a&gt;, is thought to have a particularly large settlement of elves—as well as other mystical beings like dwarves (who also fit under the broad category of &lt;em&gt;huldufólk&lt;/em&gt;). According to local clairvoyants, the &lt;em&gt;huldufólk&lt;/em&gt; royal family lives at the base of a cliff in that town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elf-spotting is an intergenerational phenomenon in Iceland, although more children than adults report seeing &lt;em&gt;huldufólk&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, it’s thought that many who are born clairvoyant lose the ability after the age of 8 or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, after children grow old enough to no longer have imaginary friends they also lose the ability to see elves. What are the odds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a benign delusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Icelanders try to build roads or settlements through elf dwellings, the elves are said to go bonkers—causing equipment failures and other problems. In the early 1970s, for example, contractors trying to move a large rock to make way for a highway near Reykjavík hired a clairvoyant, Zophanías Pétursson, after experiencing several minor mishaps. Pétursson detected the presence of elves and claimed to obtain a waiver from the supernatural creatures so that work could progress. But the elves weren’t finished: A bulldozer operator who had helped move the stone fractured a water pipe that fed into a fish farm, killing thousands of trout hatchlings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Pétursson apparently failed to mollify the highway-hating elves, &lt;em&gt;huldufólk&lt;/em&gt; experts believe negotiation is possible. If a construction supervisor suspects he might be heading into an elfin zone or just wants to rule out the possibility, he can hire a medium (by asking for a reference from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Elf_School"&gt;Icelandic Elf School&lt;/a&gt;, for example). Elves sometimes agree either to move or to let a construction project go forth unimpeded as long as the workers don’t blow up their nearby dwelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s right. There’s actual an elf school and these lunatics use this silly superstition to influence public projects. Can you imagine a hospital is being built, a minor screw up sets the project back a day, these idiots cry that the elves did it and demand all construction stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of nuttiness sounds awfully familiar even though we don’t have widespread elf-belief in the U.S. Instead of elves we’ve got angels and demons and gods. Oh my!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004882" title=""&gt;Regulation of Clock-Controlled Genes in Mammals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The complexity of tissue- and day time-specific regulation of thousands of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) suggests that many regulatory mechanisms contribute to the transcriptional output of the circadian clock. We aim to predict these mechanisms using a large scale promoter analysis of CCGs. Our study is based on a meta-analysis of DNA-array data from rodent tissues. We searched in the promoter regions of 2065 CCGs for highly overrepresented transcription factor binding sites. In order to compensate the relatively high GC-content of CCG promoters, a novel background model to avoid a bias towards GC-rich motifs was employed. We found that many of the transcription factors with overrepresented binding sites in CCG promoters exhibit themselves circadian rhythms. Among the predicted factors are known regulators such as CLOCK:BMAL1, DBP, HLF, E4BP4, CREB, RORα and the recently described regulators HSF1, STAT3, SP1 and HNF-4α. As additional promising candidates of circadian transcriptional regulators PAX-4, C/EBP, EVI-1, IRF, E2F, AP-1, HIF-1 and NF-Y were identified. Moreover, GC-rich motifs (SP1, EGR, ZF5, AP-2, WT1, NRF-1) and AT-rich motifs (MEF-2, HMGIY, HNF-1, OCT-1) are significantly overrepresented in promoter regions of CCGs. Putative tissue-specific binding sites such as HNF-3 for liver, NKX2.5 for heart or Myogenin for skeletal muscle were found. The regulation of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene was analysed, which exhibits many binding sites for circadian regulators. We provide experimental evidence for its circadian regulated expression in the adult murine kidney. Basing on a comprehensive literature search we integrate our predictions into a regulatory network of core clock and clock-controlled genes. Our large scale analysis of the CCG promoters reveals the complexity and extensiveness of the circadian regulation in mammals. Results of this study point to connections of the circadian clock to other functional systems including metabolism, endocrine regulation and pharmacokinetics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004844" title=""&gt;Learning of Arbitrary Association between Visual and Auditory Novel Stimuli in Adults: The "Bond Effect" of Haptic Exploration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is well-known that human beings are able to associate stimuli (novel or not) perceived in their environment. For example, this ability is used by children in reading acquisition when arbitrary associations between visual and auditory stimuli must be learned. The studies tend to consider it as an "implicit" process triggered by the learning of letter/sound correspondences. The study described in this paper examined whether the addition of the visuo-haptic exploration would help adults to learn more effectively the arbitrary association between visual and auditory novel stimuli. Adults were asked to learn 15 new arbitrary associations between visual stimuli and their corresponding sounds using two learning methods which differed according to the perceptual modalities involved in the exploration of the visual stimuli. Adults used their visual modality in the "classic" learning method and both their visual and haptic modalities in the "multisensory" learning one. After both learning methods, participants showed a similar above-chance ability to recognize the visual and auditory stimuli and the audio-visual associations. However, the ability to recognize the visual-auditory associations was better after the multisensory method than after the classic one. This study revealed that adults learned more efficiently the arbitrary association between visual and auditory novel stimuli when the visual stimuli were explored with both vision and touch. The results are discussed from the perspective of how they relate to the functional differences of the manual haptic modality and the hypothesis of a "haptic bond" between visual and auditory stimuli.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004837" title=""&gt;Association and Haplotype Analyses of Positional Candidate Genes in Five Genomic Regions Linked to Scrotal Hernia in Commercial Pig Lines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scrotal hernia in pigs is a complex trait likely affected by genetic and environmental factors. A large-scale association analysis of positional and functional candidate genes was conducted in four previously identified genomic regions linked to hernia susceptibility on Sus scrofa chromosomes 2 and 12, as well as the fifth region around 67 cM on chromosome 2, respectively. In total, 151 out of 416 SNPs discovered were genotyped successfully. Using a family-based analysis we found that four regions surrounding ELF5, KIF18A, COL23A1 on chromosome 2, and NPTX1 on chromosome 12, respectively, may contain the genetic variants important for the development of the scrotal hernia in pigs. These findings were replicated in another case-control dataset. The SNPs around the ELF5 region were in high linkage disequilibrium with each other, and a haplotype containing SNPs from ELF5 and CAT was highly significantly associated with hernia development. Extensive re-sequencing work focused on the KIF18A gene did not detect any further SNPs with extensive association signals. These genes may be involved in the estrogen receptor signaling pathway (KIF18A and NPTX1), the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ELF5) and the collagen metabolism pathway (COL23A1), which are associated with the important molecular characteristics of hernia pathophysiology. Further investigation on the molecular mechanisms of these genes may provide more molecular clues on hernia development in pigs.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_135.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/EPyaFOiQ6fQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236998176638"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/watching-17-and-counting-terr/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1b18350d6fd10f76</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">Watching 17 and Counting, terr…</title><published>2009-03-14T02:29:22Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T02:29:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/watching-17-and-counting-terr/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Watching 17 and Counting, terrifying stuff&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236997418361"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/13/47-of-americans-need-to-be-launched-into-a-heliocentric-orbit/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0017aad1407c517</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">47% of Americans need to be launched into a heliocentric orbit</title><published>2009-03-14T02:16:15Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T02:16:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/13/47-of-americans-need-to-be-launched-into-a-heliocentric-orbit/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sigh. I should be surprised by stuff like this, but the most damning thing about it is that I’m not surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090312115133.htm"&gt;Only 53% of adult Americans know it takes the Earth a year to go around the Sun.&lt;/a&gt; The reason it’s not surprising to me is that that’s how many Americans couldn’t ask Oprah or Dr. Phil about it first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the result of a survey done by the California Academy of Sciences. The other results aren’t a whole lot more encouraging. What slays me is that the vast majority of Americans think that science is important to their lives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this lack of knowledge, U.S. adults do believe that scientific research and education are important. About 4 in 5 adults think science education is “absolutely essential” or “very important” to the U.S. healthcare system (86%), the U.S. global reputation (79%), and the U.S. economy (77%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that’s a start; at least people know it’s important. The thing is, they don’t act like it! Just knowing science is critical hardly matters if people don’t a) understand it, and b) vote about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s not like this is new. I have a book called &lt;em&gt;Worlds Apart&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/pdf/worldsapart.pdf"&gt;available as a free PDF from The First Amendment Center&lt;/a&gt;, and well worth reading if you’re as concerned about this as I am), loaded with studies that have pretty much the same results as this recent survey, except this book came out more than ten years ago. Nothing has changed, really, and I suspect nothing will for a long time. The system is broken, we’re not teaching our kids good science, and how to fix it is a mystery. I think a lot of what we’re doing is right — science is exciting, and a lot of outreach does a good job of showing that — but somewhere in our educational system the ball is being dropped. People have devoted their careers to studying this, and I wonder how much closer we are to a solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t know. I don’t mean to be bleak or anything here, but I know there are no quick solutions. But I’m not even sure we have a slow one. Obama has talked about overhauling the educational system, but I’ll believe that when I see it. The last overhaul — No Child Left Behind — is an unmitigated disaster, which was no surprise to those of us in the education field when it passed. I’d love to see that torn down first, but what to build in its place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there are people out there with the right ideas, something that we can implement to mitigate this. I suppose that’s a rhetorical question, but with surveys like this showing we’re not getting any better, it’s an increasingly important one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236996162375"><id gr:original-id="http://www.badscience.net/2009/03/scumbag/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c1d141f60ad811bd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bad science"/><title type="html">Scumbag</title><published>2009-03-14T01:44:07Z</published><updated>2009-03-14T01:44:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/03/scumbag/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscience.net/" type="html">Ben Goldacre

A person acts out because of something related to their disability, is punished for it as though it were intentionally malicious, which causes the person to feel bad and act up more and--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the article, breaking the cycle involves awareness on the part of the police, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, it was soon revealed to me that the youth suffered from a learning disability and to me this would change everything in my approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking the cycle also involves awareness of the learning disability and appropriate support for the person with the learning disability, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that there is an unmistakable connection between early diagnosis and early intervention with someone who has a learning disability and the chance that they become criminalized. Persons who were not diagnosed and therefore did not receive any support for their disability are more vulnerable because their behavior can be seen as anti-social and they can easily be marginalized from the rest of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of Monday in my native state of California, &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-banks12-2009mar12,0,5419816.column"&gt;insurance coverage&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/10/BUPL160AV1.DTL"&gt;speech, occupational and physical therapies&lt;/a&gt; for individuals on the autism spectrum has been mandated. &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/insurance_and_autism_not_just_for_aba"&gt;ABA&lt;/a&gt; (Applied Behavior Analysis) therapy is not covered by the new regulations.  In Utah, a bill ("&lt;a href="http://senatesite.com/blog/2009/02/clays-law.html"&gt;Clay's Law&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="http://senatesite.com/blog/2009/02/clays-law.html"&gt;SB43&lt;/a&gt;) that originally called on insurance companies to cover $25,000 to$50,000 of autism "treatment" has been "watered down" to the point that support is being withdrawn from it. Another bill proposes that parents be allowed to buy coverage through Utah's Health Insurance Pool; parents would have to buy such coverage by the time their child is 3 months old, way before autism is typically diagnosed in young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the ubiquitous talk of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/the_bottom_line_vs_the_best_education"&gt;budget cuts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090311/NEWS02/903100319"&gt;schools eliminating supports and staff&lt;/a&gt;, this is not encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still wish to sound a hopeful note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/9-years-ago-charlie-was-diagnosed/"&gt;Charlie was diagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, there wasn't any regular and widespread talk of such legislation. If you wanted to try to get your insurance to cover services for autism, you were on your own. School districts weren't cutting supports and staff because they didn't have any programs to support and sufficient, and sufficiently trained staff, to sustain them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe there is progress of a sort: Now we're clamoring to get what's needed, and the calls (here in the US) are nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small steps are still steps and we're all still walking onward here.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236978968353"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4739083084025834634">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/79be0e84000b338f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Shepherd's Pie</title><published>2009-03-13T21:04:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T21:18:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/shepherds-pie.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4739083084025834634/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4739083084025834634" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> John Wilkins knows about Real Meat Pies.Janet Stemwedel has a recipe for Vegetarian Shepherd&amp;#39;s Pie.VEGETARIAN SHEPHERD&amp;#39;S PIE!!!!

&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; way cool. Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/news_center/news/031209.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/newhorizons_neptunetriton.jpg" alt="Neptune and Triton as seen by New Horizons"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image shows Neptune and its large moon Triton. That’s a remarkable shot, given that the planet and moon were nearly &lt;em&gt;four billion kilometers away&lt;/em&gt; when it was taken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/13/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-pluto/"&gt;in the Pluto post&lt;/a&gt;, Neptune and Pluto never get really close together, so New Horizons isn’t exactly dropping by on its way to Pluto. This image was taken as a test of the equipment, and has some scientific value &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001873/"&gt;as Emily points out&lt;/a&gt;. And as the press release says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triton is only slightly larger than Pluto (1,700 miles [2,700 kilometers] in diameter compared to Pluto’s 1,500 miles [2,400 kilometers]). Both objects have atmospheres primarily composed of nitrogen gas with a surface pressure only 1/70,000th of Earth’s, and comparably cold surface temperatures (-390° F on Triton and -370° F on Pluto). Triton is widely believed to have once been a member of the Kuiper Belt (as Pluto still is) that was captured into orbit around Neptune, probably during a collision early in the solar system’s history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Horizons will start taking images of Pluto while it’s still a long way off from the tiny world, so this observations shows the probe is up to the task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you’re curious, the image itself is interesting. Neptune was overexposed, causing that column of light called &lt;em&gt;blooming&lt;/em&gt;. This kind of detector &amp;quot;sees&amp;quot; light by converting incoming photons into electrons, and then counting the electrons. But if an object is too bright, too many electrons are created which overflow the pixels, something like rain overflowing a bucket. Due to the structure of the detector, the electrons flow more easily in one direction than another, and you get blooming. Worse, this effect can suppress the number of electrons seen per pixel along that column, which is why there is a dark streak above Neptune as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of thing is just something you have to deal with when using electronic detectors of this type. It takes a while to get used to it, and can lead to all sorts of problems (there could be a faint interesting source near your target that gets obliterated by this effect). It also leads to pseudoscience, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/planetx/soho.html"&gt;as I pointed out in my Planet X debunking a while back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In science you have to understand your camera just as well as your astronomical target. Clearly, the astronomers involved with New Horizons did for their detector, since you’ll note that Triton is off to the side, away from the blooming issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;And for those wondering about the post title… it’s from &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;. Ursula said it, and I used to imitate her to crack up The Little Astronomer when she was very little.

&lt;p&gt;Count this as another loss for the Discovery Institute in Iowa—right behind
its failed efforts to portray intelligent design as legitimate research in Iowa universities.
 
The “Evolution Academic Freedom Act,” based on the model language promoted by the Discovery Institute, never even made it out of the relevant subcommittee in the Iowa legislature. March 13 was the deadline for any further action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill was introduced by Rod Roberts, a Republican legislator, in early February. By mid-February, the faculty at Iowa institutions of higher learning launched a petition that eventually gathered some 240 signatories from about 20 colleges, universities, and research institutions in Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glenn Branch of the National Center for Science Education told the &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/news/2009/03/iowa-faculty-decry-antievolution-bill-004633" rel="external "&gt;Chronicle of Higher Education (February 25, 2009) “that the new Iowa statement is apparently the first organized response to such a bill by college faculty members throughout a state.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the bill was given little chance of passing from the start, the petition helped to inform legislators and the public of the depth of resistance to such a bill within the academic and scientific community.  Iowa faculty wanted to nip this bill in the bud before we had another Louisiana on our hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the faculty petition was published, Casey Luskin, a lawyer working for the Discovery Institute, was sent scrambling for airtime on Iowa radio in order to help salvage the bill.  But Luskin’s arguments on Iowa’s airwaves did not convince anyone that counted and Luskin’s performance only exposed the truth that this bill was mostly the product of the DI and its Iowa sympathizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the bill was meant to protect Intelligent Design was clearly evident to those who have followed the ID controversy. First, much of its language was cut-and-pasted from the model bill from the Discovery Institute. Compare the DI version &lt;a href="http://www.academicfreedompetition.com/freedom.php" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
with the Iowa bill &lt;a href="http://coolice.legis.state.ia.us/Cool-ICE/default.asp?Category=billinfo&amp;amp;Service=Billbook&amp;amp;ga=83&amp;amp;hbill=HF183" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Rod Roberts said he was motivated by the Guillermo Gonzalez case at Iowa State University, which he regarded as infringing on Gonzalez’s academic freedom because of his advocacy of Intelligent Design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill would have allowed the “full range of scientific views” concerning evolution in science classrooms. What Roberts did not divulge is that the DI regards Intelligent Design as a scientific viewpoint, and so it now could be included in the full range of scientific viewpoints, especially when discussing supposed alternatives to evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the bill  stated that it was not intended to promote religion, the bill did not divulge that the Discovery Institute does not see Intelligent Design as “religion.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the proposed bill is working with different definitions of “scientific” and “religion” is the tricky part of the bill. Most laypersons or legislators not familiar with the intelligent design controversy may assume that the bill was using definitions common within the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One only finds the truth by asking the bill’s sponsors whether they specifically regard Intelligent Design as a scientific theory or as religion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the type of question that Luskin refused to answer directly when he debated the bill with me on the Jan Mickelson show (WHO Radio 1040 AM) in Des Moines on Wednesday, March 4, 2009.  The debate is available as a podcast &lt;a href="http://www.mickelson.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=439790#" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lessons for those fighting these bills in other states are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Large collective faculty petitions can help to bring attention to the depth of rejection of intelligent Design within the local scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Yes, there can be the danger that a bill may receive more attention from such petitions, but, without them, the only voices heard by legislators may be those who support these bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Yes, there may be backlash from university administrators who fear that legislators may retaliate. But we also find new legislators and administrators who support faculty efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Ask supporters of such bills directly whether they define Intelligent Design as “science” or as “religion.”  Often they get away with such bills because they rely on the readers not knowing the definitions of these terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Ask legislators if they would be willing to insert a statement that clarifies that “Intelligent Design shall not be regarded as a scientific viewpoint for the purpose of this bill.” If they resist, then you have more evidence of the true intent of the bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Discovery Institute keeps losing in Iowa because it continues to underestimate the vigilance and willingness of Iowa faculty to fight these bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we cannot not become complacent despite the DI’s repeated losses in Iowa.   The DI is  always trying to find new ways and new uninformed legislators who will do their bidding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/googleearthicon.jpg" alt="Google Earth icon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The folks who brought you the amazing Google Earth and Google Sky have also created Google Mars, a virtual map of the Red Planet. &lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/"&gt;All three are packed into one place&lt;/a&gt;, for easy download. If you’ve never used this, download it now! It’s an extremely cool and fun way to explore the Earth, the sky, and now Mars. You can roam the surface, zoom in and out, take closer hi-res looks at some features, and just generally lose hours of your life to this… but in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Google announced three new updates for Mars, and they’re pretty nifty. One is an overlay that shows old historical maps, like the ones Percival Lowell made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when he fancied Mars was crisscrossed with canals dug by a dying race. You can take that trip to Victorian Mars, all without having to oustretch your arms and say, &amp;quot;Barsoooooom.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is called Live From Mars, which is feature that will automatically update itself with the very latest imagery from NASA Mars probes. In other words, you can see the newest images of Mars pretty much as soon as the scientists do! You can also fly along with these missions and see where they’ve been and where they’re headed as they map the surface of the Red planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third feature is canned guided tours: you open them and get a tour of Mars narrated by Ira Flatow from NPR and Bill Nye (whom I hear is some sort of Science Guy). When you open these tours, Google Mars will show you the spots being discussed, and zoom in and out to show you what’s what on our neighbor planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3351029853/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3556/3351029853_ddd7a79fea.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Mars view of the volcano Olympus Mons &lt;br&gt;(featured in my tour below; click to embiggen).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can even make your own tour! I decided to try out this feature, so I made one myself. You do need to do some minimal prep for it to work. First, &lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/"&gt;download Google Earth&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll rate that a 5 on the &amp;quot;duh&amp;quot; scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, grab the KMZ file I made called &lt;a href="http://www.filefactory.com/file/af5f8b8/n/Google_Mars_Intro_Tour_kmz"&gt;Google_Mars_Intro_Tour.kmz&lt;/a&gt; (do NOT save this link; click it to go to a free file storage site, and click where it says &amp;quot;Download for free with FileFactory Basic&amp;quot;; it’s an 800kB file). This file is just a set of instructions for Google Mars and has my tour encoded in it. Save it on your computer wherever you want but make it accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/googleearthtoolbar.jpg" alt="Google Earth toolbar"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, open Google Earth. Once it’s open and you see our lovely blue planet, go to the top where there is a menu bar of icons. One looks like Saturn. Click it, and then click &lt;strong&gt;Mars&lt;/strong&gt; in the drop-down menu. Mars will suddenly appear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/googleearthsidebar.gif" alt="Google Earth sidebar"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost there. In the left sidebar is a menu called &lt;strong&gt;Layers&lt;/strong&gt;. In there is a heading called &lt;strong&gt;Spacecraft Imagery&lt;/strong&gt;. Click the little triangle, then click the button next to &lt;strong&gt;HiRISE Image Browser&lt;/strong&gt;. That turns on the layer giving you images from the HiRISE camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right above &lt;strong&gt;Spacecraft Imagery&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;Global Maps&lt;/strong&gt;. Click the triangle, then click in the circle next to &lt;strong&gt;Visible Imagery&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Now double click the KML file you downloaded (by the way, you have to have Mars open before you open the KMZ file or else this won’t work at all). When you do, you’ll hear my dulcet but mildly goofy tones, taking you on a brief tour of Mars. Just sit back and let Google do the work for you. The whole thing is less than two minutes, and at the end I get a little conspiratorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole package has obvious educational benefits; you can now show people what you want them to see, in the order you want them to see it, and even with your own narration! This works for Earth and for Sky as well. I can see this being used &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Earth/Sky/Mars is so much fun. You can bookmark places, save them, send them to other people, and a lot more. This is an incredible tool, and it’s lots of fun to play. So go! Explore Mars!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236971306755"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4713">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ae146831d2ecc6a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Freakonomics"/><category term="photography"/><title type="html">FREAK Shots: Naked Flickr Promotion</title><published>2009-03-13T18:35:56Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T18:35:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/WvYCWKDkgos/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/freak-shots-naked-flickr-promotion/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Thanks to Flickr's &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/"&gt;Creative Commons&lt;/a&gt; (made possible, in part, by &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/20/bring-your-questions-for-lawrence-lessig/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), where Flickr users make their photography available for public use, we often use Flickr images to spruce up this blog.

I said I thought Cupertinos would continue to be with us in one form or another, in large part because of the proper name problem: a reasonably restrictive spellchecker dictionary can never encompass all the  proper names that might appear in a given text, particularly unusual foreign names. Consider the old &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005361.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obama&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;Osama &lt;/em&gt;tangle&lt;/a&gt;: after 9/11, &lt;em&gt;Osama&lt;/em&gt; was added to Microsoft's spellchecker dictionary,  but at the time no one could have predicted that &lt;em&gt;Obama&lt;/em&gt; would also be  an important name to include. Thus they had to scramble to add &lt;em&gt;Obama&lt;/em&gt; when he rose to prominence and spellcheckers were giving &lt;em&gt;Osama&lt;/em&gt;  as the first suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as if on cue, the District of Columbia Republican Committee kindly illustrates my point in a new press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wonkette.com/406975/this-kendra-character-should-resign"&gt;Wonkette&lt;/a&gt; reports that the DC GOP sent out the following release:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday the 13th Brings Horrors to the District&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington, DC: The DC Republican Committee made the following  statement in regard to yesterday’s news that the FBI raided the DC’s  Chief Technology Office and arrested one District employee and a well  known contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s ironic that as the FBI was raiding Vive Kendra’s former  District office, when Kendra was giving a speech at FOSE about changing  the way the government procurement should be handled. Kendra made  national news last night because of his mismanagement of the District’s  Procurement Office. He should step down immediately from his position  in the Obama administration,” stated DC Republican Committee Chairman  Robert J. Kabel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who's this &lt;em&gt;Vive Kendra &lt;/em&gt;character? Turns out it's actually &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Kundra"&gt;Vivek Kundra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Kundra was born in New Delhi and moved to Tanzania (where he learned Swahili) before coming to the U.S. Unless he becomes much more famous, we wouldn't expect either his first or last name to be included in a spellchecker dictionary, as opposed to &lt;em&gt;Vive&lt;/em&gt;  (the French interjection) or the common girl's name &lt;em&gt;Kendra&lt;/em&gt;. Thus &lt;em&gt;Vive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kendra&lt;/em&gt; are the first suggestions given by the Microsoft Word spellchecker for his two names. Perhaps, as &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005301.html"&gt;Barrack Bema&lt;/a&gt;'s chief information officer, he can do something about the insidious national disease of Cupertino Creep. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Benjamin Zimmer</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236967886856"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=407">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84e5573c337ec6a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">I Work with Steve Martin</title><published>2009-03-13T18:00:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T18:00:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=407" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Partly as an antidote to the previous, depressing post, and partly because it is so deserving of exposure, I now present—verbatim except for names and other ‘identifiers’—a recent email exchange between one of my colleagues and a correspondent. It has nothing to do with SBM. My colleague, known to his friends as T-Bone, is the reluctant owner of a vacation house in Florida. He must rent it as much as possible, since no one is willing to buy it. He gets frequent queries from potential renters, but usually not of the sort illustrated below. T-Bone is a very funny person. This exchange reminds me of the pieces that Steve Martin did for the back page of the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlos, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your inquiry regarding our lakefront house in LandSilence with a view of the Gulf of Mexico from almost every room. You mentioned “apartment” in your inquiry and I just wanted to make sure you understood that this is a house, not an apartment.  To answer your question, our Winter special rate for the week of February 14th departing February 21st is $1120. We charge a $250 cleaning fee, but I see you only have 2 people in your party. If you only plan on using 1 bedroom, we can reduce the cleaning fee to $150. If that was the case, the total would be $1120 + $150 cleaning fee + 11% tax = $1509.70. We do accept credit cards.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are additional photos plus virtual tours of our house at:  &lt;a href="http://www.househere.fla.com/virtualtours/landsilence/2468"&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff"&gt;www.househere.fla.com/virtualtours/landsilence/2468&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Bone Seidler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carlos,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s great! I’m sure you’ll have a lovely stay in our home. Before you commit, there are a couple of new developments with the house that I thought you should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the recent cold snap (I’m sure you heard of it) the water pipes that were routed on top of the roof (a bad design choice, in retrospect) burst, flooding both the upper and lower floors of the house. All the furniture, floors, carpets, and electronics in the house were destroyed. In addition, the contractor working on repairs was forced to take off almost the entirety of the roof, leaving the house basically an open shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news! All the community amenities are still available to you (pool, bikes, putting course) and the beautiful white sand beach (actually some peat is showing but that’s another story) is still just a short walk away. And the lack of a roof will allow you to enjoy the warm(ish) Florida sun through the entirety of your stay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is still agreeable to you let me know. In terms of the bank account information you requested, we actually have accounts with more than one bank. Would you need all of the account numbers, or just one? We also have a retirement account, but you probably don’t need that info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warm Personal Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad it’s no problem! I was concerned that the damage to the house might deter renters, but I can see now I was worried for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the bank account number, well, it’s rather confusing. There are many numbers on the checks, but the account number appears to be 832. The funny thing is, the account number is different on every check! For example, the account number on the next check is 833. Crazy! It’s these kinds of things that are making the banks have so much trouble right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You asked about a “routing number”. I don’t think this bank has one, it’s a local bank and everyone knows where it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My credit card number is 04/2009. You asked about an expiration date, and I know exactly what you mean by that. When I’m buying milk, I always make sure to buy the freshest I can. A small hint, Carlos: Sometimes you have to reach behind and get the milk in the back. But in terms of the credit card, I don’t think it has an expiration date—it’s made of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlos, I just noticed your arrival date is February 14th-Valentine’s Day! I’ve taken the liberty of arranging for a bottle of Champagne and a dozen roses to be waiting for you and (may I presume) your lady friend when you arrive, to compensate you for the inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of inconvenience, I’ve got some great news. The contractor says he’ll be able to put a blue plastic tarp over the former bedroom area, in case it rains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what I should do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Friend,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-Bone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;……………………………..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The exchange kinda petered out there.&lt;/p&gt;

Before we get to Comment o’ the Week, a few announcements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomorrow is Pi Day&lt;/strong&gt; and we’re celebrating in Boston with a Pi(e) Fight! &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=66363901514"&gt;More info here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday is the next Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/strong&gt;, with author William Lobdell. I’m excited and you should be, too. &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=113"&gt;Info here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I banned TrueSkeptic&lt;/strong&gt; because he’s long used Skepchick as a platform from which to deliver blustery, egotistical diatribes about 9/11 conspiracy theories and I just couldn’t take it anymore when he directly insulted my intelligence. Once more, the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=2809"&gt;Commenter Code of Conduct is found here&lt;/a&gt;, and everyone is reminded that while we allow heated discussion and the occasional insult, if said insult is unfunny and directed at the girl with her finger on the big red button, that’s a bannin’. Goodbye, TrueSkeptic, you will be hazily recollected from time to time thanks to your ridiculous &lt;a href="http://32878.spreadshirt.com/us/US/Shop/Article/Index/article/Argument-from-Relation-to-Authority-Shirt-3424788"&gt;&lt;em&gt;argument ad familia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, on to the Comment! O! The! Week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, one guy pretty much had this week wrapped up. Congratulations to Expatria for &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6434&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-54682"&gt;this gem&lt;/a&gt;, offered in response to news that Iceland inhabitants love their elves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel="external nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/jjuliano"&gt;Expatria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel="external nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/jjuliano"&gt;&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a51fc3669ad1008f737a68e3e7d260bc?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Mar 13, 2009 at 11:50 am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this elf article fails to note: The three percent of Icelanders who have seen an elf perfectly overlaps with the three percent of Icelanders who are Bjork&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that might have improved that comment would have been an accompanying Venn diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expatria! Send me your Afternoon Inquisition suggestion, which will appear magically in this space on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of you!

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter's wide net draws in writers like Dorothy Canfield Fisher, whose novel, "The Home Maker," written in 1924, includes the abysmally written passage: "What was her life? A hateful round of housework, which, hurry as she might, was never done. How she &lt;em&gt;loathed&lt;/em&gt; housework! The sight of a dishpan full of dishes made her feel like screaming. And what else did she have? Loneliness; never-ending monotony; blank, gray days, one after another full of drudgery." Very few people, I imagine, would argue for the elegance of the prose, but the passage is undoubtedly interesting from a feminist point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am often baffled by a critic who merely quotes a passage while sniffily dismissing its writing style — without a word about the defects the critic sees in the passage. (I won&amp;#39;t comment here on Roiphe&amp;#39;s indirect swipe at feminism.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This particular case is especially baffling to me, since the quoted passage is from the interior monologue of one of Canfield's characters (in "free indirect style", in which a character's thoughts are represented in the third person), so if there's some infelicity in style, it should be attributed to the character, rather than to the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably be collecting cases where critics just baldly asssert that some bit of writing is shoddy, without any explanation of the basis for the judgment. (I'm not objecting to subjective judgments. I &lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; objecting to subjective judgments passed off as Obvious Truth.) I have occasionally commented on critics who actually try to offer some explanation for their judgments — almost always negative — but do so in lame ways, as in &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002380.html"&gt;this slam&lt;/a&gt; of Rachel Carson's early writing.&lt;/p&gt;

That second story is also chock full of the recently released numeric statistics, and notes that the numeric "rise has led to calls for a state panel to coordinate services, offer information."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story cites &lt;a href="http://landru.leg.state.or.us/09reg/measpdf/hb3000.dir/hb3001.intro.pdf"&gt;Oregon House Bill 3001&lt;/a&gt; which "Creates Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder and requires commission to provide strategic plan to legislature. Establishes Oregon Commission on Autism Spectrum Disorder Fund.  Continuously appropriates moneys in fund to commission."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commission looks like the next step of Representative Edwards' &lt;a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/dd/autism/"&gt;autism work group and recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, which inspired me to full ire last fall when I received an &lt;a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/dd/autism/mediaadv.pdf"&gt;invitation&lt;/a&gt; to a town hall meeting to discuss the &lt;a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/dd/autism/asd_finalreport.pdf"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt;--the invitation was for "parents and advocates of people with autism."  Not for autistic people.  I, of course, showed up anyway.  To mention not just the invitation oversight, but also the fact that the recommendation itself had been crafted without input from autistic people, and that the recommended committee did not include a slot for a self-advocate.  Here's a transcript of &lt;a href="http://news.opb.org/article/2871-services-arent-keeping-autism/"&gt;radio coverage from the meeting&lt;/a&gt;, including a quote from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my testimony, a revised version of the invitation was sent out that included self-advocates.  Good!  But too early for a cheer--I was waiting to see inclusion on the real policy level.  So I was thrilled when I read the description of HB 3001 to see (emphasis mine),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) The Governor shall appoint the following members of the commission, who must be knowledgeable about autism spectrum disorder or services for people with autism spectrum disorder: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(a) A person with autism spectrum disorder;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(b) A parent of a child with autism spectrum disorder who is under the age of 18 at the time of the parent′s appointment; &lt;br&gt;
(c) A parent of an adult with autism spectrum disorder; &lt;br&gt;
(d) A representative of an autism or disability advocacy organization; &lt;br&gt;
(e) A physician licensed under ORS chapter 677; &lt;br&gt;
(f) A representative of the Department of Education; &lt;br&gt;
(g) A representative of the Department of Human Services; &lt;br&gt;
(h) A representative of the Department of Higher Education; &lt;br&gt;
(i) A member from the public at large; &lt;br&gt;
(j) A representative of a school district or a local education service district; and &lt;br&gt;
(k) A member representing the insurance industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if my actions lead to (a) in any way, but it doesn't matter--what matters is that an autistic self-advocate is included on the commission--HOORAY!  I'm cynical enough to keep the champagne corked until I see that the appointed member will truly bring the concerns of autistic adults in the community to the table and isn't just a token "shiny."  But I'm also hopeful.  Person (d) is also of interest--would be great to see a disability rights organization, and for the representative to either be on the spectrum or to have another type of disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we self-advocates can do to make sure our interests are included in autism policy is to go to public discussions on autism legislation and demand to be included--"Nothing about us without us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this committee is created, it will be interesting to see what happens when those 13 people with very different interests come together to discuss autism policy.  How will it work with the inevitable conflict of goals represented by each of the committee members' specific interests?  Will it find a way for everyone to win?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236963726547"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/where_do_satan_et_al_publish_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e25fc76fcdb8f827</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Where do Satan et al. publish, anyway?</title><published>2009-03-13T16:30:52Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T16:30:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/-UFUt-bQvEg/where_do_satan_et_al_publish_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/where_do_satan_et_al_publish_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am sometimes accused of having a sense of humor.

A survey carried out by Harris Interactive for the California Academy of Sciences discovered, among other things, that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Only 53% of adults know how long it takes for the Earth to revolve around the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 59% of adults know that the earliest humans and dinosaurs did not live at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 47% of adults can roughly approximate the percent of the Earth’s surface that is covered with water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 21% of adults answered all three questions correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and, to get more specific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… less than 1% of U.S. adults know what percent of the planet’s water is fresh (the correct answer is 3%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many scientists, I do feel that there is something deeply depressing about numbers like this. However, I can’t help but feel that such surveys don’t get to the heart of the problem. Certainly the first two questions are things any person should know - not because they’re wonderful at remembering facts, but because an understanding of the underlying science should be a basic part of any education. But a focus on having numbers on the tip of one’s tongue isn’t really what science literacy is all about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we really lack is a population that is educated in scientific and critical &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; and problem solving. It really doesn’t matter if someone doesn’t know a specific answer to a question, as long as they know where to look for the answer, and how to understand the data and reasoning behind the correct number. Most importantly, they need the tools to be able to distinguish a robust answer from one that isn’t backed by any solid arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, most people would perform depressingly poorly on that kind of measure also. That’s the problem we need to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIRST U.S. PUBLIC ACCESS POLICY MADE PERMANENT&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2009 Consolidated Appropriations Act ensures NIH public access policy will persist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington, D.C. - March 12, 2009 - President Obama yesterday signed into law the 2009 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes a provision making the National Institutes' of Health (NIH) Public Access Policy permanent.  The NIH Revised Policy on Enhancing Public Access requires eligible NIH-funded researchers to deposit electronic copies of their peer-reviewed manuscripts into the National Library of Medicine's online archive, PubMed Central (PMC). Full texts of the articles are made publicly available and searchable online in PMC no later than 12 months after publication in a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH policy was previously implemented with a provision that was subject to annual renewal. Since the implementation of the revised policy the percentage of eligible manuscripts deposited into PMC has increased significantly, with over 3,000 new manuscripts being deposited each month. The PubMed Central database is a part of a valuable set of public database resources at the NIH, which are accessed by more than 2 million users each day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new provision reads in full:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall require in the current fiscal year and thereafter that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for them to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication: Provided, That the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with copyright law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "This is a significant moment for all of us in the health community, and for efforts in health reform.  With free access to health research, individuals are empowered with the knowledge necessary to understand the health threats they and their families face," said Sharon Terry, President and CEO of Genetic Alliance.   "Congress recognizes the incredible power of technology and innovation in enabling new solutions for the proactive management of health, consumer-driven healthcare, and novel partnerships and collaborations in research.  Congratulations to us all."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIH Public Access Policy addresses the public's growing need for high-quality health information and promotes accelerated scientific advancement in the biomedical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Public access to publicly funded research contributes directly to the mission of higher education," said David Shulenburger, Vice President for Academic Affairs at NASULGC (the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges). "Improved access will enable universities to maximize their own investment in research, and widen the potential for discovery as the results are more readily available for others to build upon."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather Joseph, spokesperson for the Alliance for Taxpayer Access noted, "Thanks to the work of a wide coalition of patients, libraries, researchers, publishers, students, and taxpayers, the results of NIH-funded research can be accessed - and used  - in ways never before possible. The successful implementation of this policy will unlock the potential of this research to benefit the public as a whole. "&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the NIH provision does not need to be renewed every year - it is now permanent. The Conyers bill is still a danger, but perhaps a little less so....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_nih_public_access_policy_i.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/ZwQOqkroWdY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236954148933"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_origin_and_evolution_of_sc.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/71dff8518209923e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">The origin and evolution of ScienceDebate2008</title><published>2009-03-13T14:34:45Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T14:34:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Y1xmO1TN1fk/the_origin_and_evolution_of_sc.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_origin_and_evolution_of_sc.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In November 2007, a group of six citizens decided to do something to elevate science and technology in the national dialogue. They created Science Debate 2008, an initiative calling for a presidential debate on science policy. They put up a Web site, and began encouraging friends and colleagues to sign a petition calling for the debate. Within weeks 38,000 scientists, engineers, and other concerned citizens had signed on. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the National Academies, and the Council on Competitiveness (CoC) joined as cosponsors, although Science Debate 2008 remained independent, financed by individual contributions and volunteer labor. Within months it grew to represent virtually all of U.S. science, including almost every major science organization, the presidents of over 100 universities, prominent corporate leaders, Nobel laureates, and members of Congress. All told, the signatory organizations represented over 125 million Americans, making it arguably the largest political initiative in the history of U.S. science....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Or so says &lt;a href="http://www.sennoma.net/main/archives/2009/03/on_science_and_selfishness.php" title=""&gt;Bill Hooker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance: I use Open Office in preference to Word because I'm willing to put up with a short learning curve and a few inconveniences, having (as they say here in the US) drunk the Open Kool-Aid. But I'm something of an exception. Faced with a single difficulty, one single function that doesn't work exactly like it did in Word, the vast majority of researchers will throw a tantrum and give up on the new application. After all, the Department pays the Word license, so it's there to be used, so who cares about monopolies and stifling free culture and all that hippy kum-ba-yah crap when I've got a paper to write that will make me the most famous and important scientist in all the world?

&lt;p&gt;----------snip-------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have their set ways of doing things, and they are very, very resistant to change -- I think this might be partly due to the kind of personality that ends up in research, but it's also a response to the pressure to produce. In science, only one kind of productivity counts -- that is, keeps you in a job, brings in funding, wins your peers' respect -- and that's published papers. The resulting pressure makes whatever leads to published papers urgent and limits everything else to -- at best -- important; and urgent trumps important every time. Remember the old story about the guy struggling to cut down a tree with a blunt saw? To suggestions that his work would go faster if he sharpened the saw, he replies that he doesn't have time to sit around sharpening tools, he's got a tree to cut down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;------------snip------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that's true, but like the guy with the saw, scientists are caught up in short-term thinking. Put the case to most of them, and they'll agree about the advantages of Open over closed -- for instance, I've yet to meet anyone who disagreed on principle that Open Access could dramatically improve the efficiency of knowledge dissemination, that is, the efficiency of the entire scientific endeavour. I've also yet to meet more than a handful of people willing to commit to sending their own papers only to OA journals, or even to avoiding journals that won't let them self-archive! "I have a job to keep", they say, "I'm not going to sacrifice my livelihood to the greater good"; or "that's great, but first I need to get this grant funded"; or my personal favourite, "once I have tenure I'll start doing all that good stuff". (Sure you will. But I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;---------------snip-------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to scientists, you don't just have to hand them a sharper saw, you have to force them to stop sawing long enough to change to the new tool. All they know is that the damn tree has to come down on time and they will be in terrible trouble (/fail to be recognized for their genius) if it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is it true that for scientists to adopt any new way of doing things, Carrots don't work, only Big Sticks?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/why_are_scientists_so_hard_to.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/hfGJ3-AVNzI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236954148932"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_profzi_scheme.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/15f5c826b723021b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Academia"/><title type="html">The Profzi Scheme</title><published>2009-03-13T13:53:41Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T13:53:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/Bi7lZL8dzKI/the_profzi_scheme.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_profzi_scheme.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1144" title=""&gt;this is how&lt;/a&gt; the academia works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, wait a minute. I mean: Nooooooo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No place is safe from the invasion of &lt;a href="http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/01/exposing-quackery-in-medical-education.html"&gt;quackademic medicine&lt;/a&gt;. No place. As you will soon see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, I've documented the infiltration of pseudoscientific and outright antiscientific woo into institutions that really should know better, namely academic medical institutions. Specifically, over a year ago, I created the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_woo_aggregator.php"&gt;Academic Woo Aggregator&lt;/a&gt;, a list of medical schools and academic medical centers that have embraced "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) or, as it's more commonly known these days, "integrative medicine" (IM). Of course, the latter name is nothing more than yet another attempt to "rebrand" CAM as being sufficiently equal to scientific medicine that it is worth "integrating" into science- and evidence-based practice, even though no one can seem to provide either a compelling evidentiary argument for integrating such pseudoscience into "conventional" medicine. Be that as it may, institutions where I've worked have remained (mostly) untouched by this problem--fortunately. That means I have been blissfully fortunate in not having had to deal with the infiltration of psuedoscience into my workplace. I hope it stays that way, but I don't have any illusions that I'm immune. When that day comes, I'm going to have to throw down the gauntlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May that day be far off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, though, I've discovered something that has disturbed me greatly. &lt;a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/health/2009/03/an_alternative_to_conventional.html"&gt;Woo has invaded my old stomping grounds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/noooo_not_quackademic_medicine_at_my_old.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/noooo_not_quackademic_medicine_at_my_old.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/GSlrnf2q1D4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236947733106"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/interviewing-today-sitting-on/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/31234f6f7fca696d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">interviewing today, sitting on…</title><published>2009-03-13T12:15:09Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T12:15:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/interviewing-today-sitting-on/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;interviewing today, sitting on the other side of the desk to the one I’m used to&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236947441973"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6426">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0575acf29e96b8d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><category term="rape"/><category term="violence"/><category term="women"/><title type="html">Kitty Genovese: March 13, 1964</title><published>2009-03-13T12:15:17Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T12:15:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6426" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=04d48b3bb90a23da3a8368762d26a8f7&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, 45 years ago, a beautiful young woman was sexually assaulted and stabbed  in New York. The assault lasted half an hour, and occurred outside of an apartment building where  &lt;em&gt;38 witnesses either heard or saw the attack and did nothing to stop it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They did nothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not reported at the time, but Kitty was also a lesbian, and &lt;a href="http://soundportraits.org/on-air/remembering_kitty_genovese/"&gt;left behind a bereaved partner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her story has come into the media again because of &lt;a href="http://www.angelfire.com/comics/mooreportal/kitty.html"&gt;Watchmen&lt;/a&gt;–Many people think it is part of the fiction of the book.&lt;br&gt;
It isn’t.  Alan Moore has a &lt;a href="http://www.angelfire.com/comics/mooreportal/kitty.html"&gt;reprint of a newspaper story of the time&lt;/a&gt; on his website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wired has a &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2009/03/dayintech_0313"&gt;very nice discussion&lt;/a&gt; of all the various social science theories that grew out of this event. Two examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance"&gt;Pluralistic ignorance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Collective inaction by a large group encourages individuals within the group to accept that nothing is seriously amiss (”nobody else thinks it’s serious”), even when his gut tells him otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility"&gt;Diffusion of responsibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People have a tendency to avoid taking responsibility in critical situations, instead relying on another person to step up (”someone else is in charge” or “someone else is better able to deal with this”). The assumption that someone will do so becomes more pronounced in larger groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to be open about my status as a rape survivor because I don’t think it’s something I should be ashamed of. I didn’t make it happen–it just happened.  Also, as someone who has the benefit of 20+ years of time and healing, I can say things that more recent survivors may not be able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want to know is: What are &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt; doing to prevent this from happening again? Or about any violence against women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think it won’t happen now? What about the cop that &lt;a href="http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/03/03/nypd-accused-of-raping-intoxicated-woman/"&gt;stood by while his partner raped a drunk women&lt;/a&gt; last month? What about all the discussion that &lt;a href="http://www.afrobella.com/2009/02/09/as-an-island-woman/"&gt;Rhianna “caused” the attack by her partner&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t deny the little feeling in your gut that says “uh oh.”&lt;br&gt;
Don’t place all the responsibility for preventing rape on women, by restricting our movements and making us live in fear.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/34129724.html"&gt;Challenge the Rape Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the brilliant Ill*Doctrine says we need to &lt;a href="http://www.illdoctrine.com/2008/07/how_to_tell_people_they_sound.html"&gt;call people out when they say things that sound racist&lt;/a&gt;, please make sure you speak up when anyone is making light of violence against women, or joking about “raping” someone or anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>bug_girl</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236946997234"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/links_for_2009-03-13.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2ce7e2007bd344d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linkfest"/><title type="html">links for 2009-03-13</title><published>2009-03-13T13:05:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T13:05:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/y4e7fgo5zOE/links_for_2009-03-13.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/links_for_2009-03-13.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;

Christians and atheists fear for the future if one side dominates the landscape. Now let me write about the trust factor. We don't trust each other to be truthful and objective with the evidence. Red flags go up whenever the other side makes an argument because we don't trust each other's research nor their authors. On each side of the fence we think the other side distorts its facts to fit their preconceived conclusions.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s why Ed Babinski has argued that if we do a great deal of reading we will eventually read an author just a little to the left of us, perhaps in college as part of a research project. While this author may be outside our comfort zone he’s not so far out there that we can't give him some kind of benefit of the doubt. Then if he convinces us we’ll read a book he recommends which might be to the left of him. This process takes place slowly if at all. That’s the process by which I learned to reject my Christian faith. It wasn’t because I read the atheist literature, although I read a few of their books, it was because I continued to read book after book by Christian authors who were more theologically liberal than the previous one. It was Christian scholarship that eventually caused the downfall of my faith. And their books were books that didn’t throw up the red flags because they were only a step to the left of me rather than being way over on the other side of the intellectual universe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the trust factor there is one type of person who stands in the gap between atheists and Christians. It's the apostate; whether it’s a former Christian who became an atheist, or a former atheist who became a Christian. The impact of their apostasy has more of an effect when we personally know them, but it does have a general impact on the other side anyway, especially the more well-known the person is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These apostates are usually not liked by the side they left because they are an embarrassment to them. Since apostates have some kind of credibility the opposing side tries to discredit them. That’s probably one of the reasons why the team members here at DC are personally attacked so much. The attempt is to discredit us in one way or another so believers can write us off. It makes them feel better. It lets them sleep at night. It reassures them that the problem wasn’t with the faith at all, but rather that the problem was us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, I guess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My view is that people just change their minds from time to time, that’s all. We do this about a myriad of issues throughout our lives. Why should it be different with regard to religious or non-religious beliefs? We don’t ever need to attack the apostate who leaves our side for the other side. I don't do this. People are people and they believe for different reasons, that’s all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-5527004133344800664?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I'm glad people are thinking and attempting to deal with my arguments, of course. But some of these sites are filled with so many obvious straw man type arguments, non-sequiturs, either/or fallacies, and/or &lt;em&gt;ad hominems&lt;/em&gt; that it amazes me these writers actually think they've considered my arguments at all. I don't think this is just a matter of believers who are blinded by their faith, although that's certainly a factor. It's that they cannot think. There are rules for thinking critically and these people cannot do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case, when I see these types of sites I figure it won't do any good to respond because if they couldn't think critically in their first post they won't be able to do so a second time in response to my comment.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-2785159094273109747?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

A time when the US turns its attention to an important event–a type of &lt;strong&gt;March Madness&lt;/strong&gt;, if you will. People stock up on food, buy special t-shirts, and drink alcoholic libations in mass quantities.  It’s….&lt;a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/11468"&gt;&lt;img title="mnmenurhoside2" src="http://membracid.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/mnmenurhoside2.jpg?w=194&amp;amp;h=300" alt="mnmenurhoside2" width="194" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sainturho.com/index.htm"&gt;St. Urho’s Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Urho (pronounced “oorho”) is a &lt;a href="http://www.sainturho.com/origin.htm"&gt;completely made-up saint&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, Finnish Minnesotans were sick of green beer and Irish hoopla in March, and decided they needed their own holiday on March 16th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The legend says St. Urho chased the grasshoppers out of ancient Finland, thus saving the grape crop and the jobs of Finnish vineyard workers. He did this by uttering the phrase: &lt;/em&gt;“Heinäsirkka, heinäsirkka, mene täältä hiiteen” &lt;em&gt;(roughly translated: “Grasshopper, grasshopper, go to Hell!”). His feast is celebrated by wearing the colors Royal Purple and Nile Green. St. Urho is nearly always represented with grapes and grasshoppers as part of the picture…..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, the St. Urho tradition is carried on in many Finnish communities, sometimes as an excuse to add an extra day of rowdy celebration to the St. Patrick’s Day festivities. In many Finnish-American communities, however, St. Urho’s Day is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the celebration, and St. Pat’s feast day is merely an afterthought, a day to sleep off the hangover.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Urho’s victory over grasshoppers is celebrated by this &lt;a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/sights/sightstory.php?tip_AttrId=%3D11468"&gt;statue in Menahga, MN&lt;/a&gt;. A very amazing chainsaw sculpture!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;Support  this champion of biological control by drinking some purple wine or purple beer (Ew!) &lt;strong&gt;March 16th&lt;/strong&gt;, in honor of St. Urho’s entomological feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Pity poor Pluto.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Sure, it reigned as the last planet in the solar system for more than 70 years, but then it was stripped of that title by the International Astronomical Union in a manner so profoundly dumb that I&amp;#39;m still wondering what they were thinking. I do think that the definition of planet can be debated, and that Pluto plays its part, but the IAU really screwed the pooch with the way they did it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Whether you call Pluto a planet, an iceball, or an animated dog, it&amp;#39;s still a very interesting object. And today, March 13, 2009, marks the 79th anniversary of the announcement of Pluto to the world (&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/05/illinois-plutocrats/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;and in Illinois it&amp;#39;s officially Pluto Day&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;), so what better time to talk about it? We know a lot more about it than we did in 1930... and while you may know &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;some&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; of its features, I just bet that if I listed ten of them, there may be one or two Things You Don&amp;#39;t Know About Pluto. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A study published in the latest edition of the Journal of Mammalogy reports the results of a 30 year study on a population of northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), which shows that the male:female pup ratio is significantly higher in years with warmer sea surface temperature and weaker atmospheric pressure differentials.

&lt;p&gt;What is the mechanism behind this? Unlike reptiles, which actually have their biological sex determined by temperature, the sex of mammalian embryos is entirely dependent on their chromosomes. This is where the phenomenon differs between the two taxa: reptiles depend on environmental factors to determine sex, whereas in mammals it is the sex ratio of offspring that complete development that is affected. Sex ratios are adjusted by selectively resorbing or aborting embryos of a specific sex. But which sex gets the boot when times are hard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global warming? More and more male elephant seals fighting to death over fewer and fewer females?

Here are my own picks for the week - you go and look for your own favourites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000336" title=""&gt;Abnormal Brain Iron Homeostasis in Human and Animal Prion Disorders&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Prion disorders are neurodegenerative conditions of humans and animals that are invariably fatal. The main agent responsible for neurotoxicity in all prion disorders is PrP-scrapie (PrPSc), a β-sheet rich isoform of a normal cell-surface glycoprotein, the prion protein (PrPC). Deposits of PrPSc in the brain parenchyma are believed to induce neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Emerging evidence from prion-infected cell and mouse models implicates redox-iron in prion disease-associated neurotoxicity. However, a systematic evaluation of iron homeostasis in prion disease-affected brains and the underlying mechanism of iron dyshomeostasis are lacking. In this report, we demonstrate that prion disease-affected human, mouse, and hamster brains exhibit a state of iron deficiency in the presence of excess total brain iron, resulting in a state of iron imbalance. The underlying cause of this phenotype is likely sequestration of iron in cellular ferritin that becomes detergent-insoluble, possibly due to association with PrPSc. This results in a state of iron bio-insufficiency, leading to increased iron uptake by the cells and worsening of the state of iron imbalance. Since iron is highly toxic if mismanaged, these results implicate iron imbalance as a significant contributing factor in prion disease-associated neurotoxicity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000420" title=""&gt;Genome-Wide Association Analyses Identify SPOCK as a Key Novel Gene Underlying Age at Menarche&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Menarche is a physical milestone in a woman's life. Age at menarche (AAM) is related to many common female health problems. AAM is mainly determined by genetic factors. However, the specific genes and the associated mechanisms underlying AAM are largely unknown. Here, taking advantage of the most recent technological advances in the field of human genetics, we identified multiple genetic variants in a gene, SPOCK, which are associated with AAM variation in a group of Caucasian women. This association was subsequently confirmed not only in two independent groups of Caucasian women but also across ethnic boundaries in one group of Chinese women. In addition, SPOCK has a function in regulating a key factor involved in menstrual cycles, MMP-2, which provides further support to our findings. Our study provides a solid basis for further investigation of the gene, which may help to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the timing of menarche and for AAM's relationship with women's health in general.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000418" title=""&gt;Life, Death, Differentiation, and the Multicellularity of Bacteria&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In recent years, bacterial geneticists and microbiologists have begun moving away from the view that the clonal cell populations they study in the lab are homogeneous lots of identical, autonomous individuals and toward one that was suggested decades ago [1], in which social and even multicellular attributes of bacteria are recognized. Bacterial clones display differentiation, development, cell-cell communication, aging, and even apparent apoptosis, and not just the species with visually appreciable phase variations of surface proteins, spore formation, or variation between swimming and sessile cell types. These features appear to be ubiquitous, applying even to Escherichia coli, which has been long regarded as a laboratory model for producing homogeneous cell clones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000414" title=""&gt;A Human Protein Interaction Network Shows Conservation of Aging Processes between Human and Invertebrate Species&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Studies of longevity in model organisms such as baker's yeast, roundworm, and fruit fly have clearly demonstrated that a diverse array of genetic mutations can result in increased life span. In fact, large-scale genetic screens have identified hundreds of genes that when mutated, knocked down, or deleted will significantly enhance longevity in these organisms. Despite great progress in understanding genetic and genomic determinants of life span in model organisms, the general relevance of invertebrate longevity genes to human aging and longevity has yet to be fully established. In this study, we show that human homologs of invertebrate longevity genes change in their expression levels during aging in human tissue. We also show that human genes encoding proteins that interact with human longevity homolog proteins are also changed in expression during human aging. These observations taken together indicate that the broad patterns underlying genetic control of life span in invertebrates is highly relevant to human aging and longevity. We also present a collection of novel candidate genes and proteins that may influence human life span.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_this_31.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/S6xvll1uhkI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236934686606"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/adorable_squishable_mammoth.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d8b5d6f333a572a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Fun"/><title type="html">Adorable squishable mammoth</title><published>2009-03-13T05:11:34Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T05:11:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/ECIfQoZBgUA/adorable_squishable_mammoth.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/adorable_squishable_mammoth.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.squishable.com/squishables/product/giant_mammoth_understudy.html" title=""&gt;Isn't it&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

New Jersey's Adults with Autism Task Force is sponsoring &lt;a href="http://www.nj.gov/nj/community/features/news/approved/090306b.html"&gt;four public fora&lt;/a&gt; to get input from Jerseyans about the needs of adults on the autism spectrum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charged with studying and evaluating the needs of adults with autism, forums are being held to gather information on issues such as job training and placement, housing and long-term care needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information from the public will be used to develop recommendations designed to support and meet the needs of adults with autism who are residents of New Jersey. The recommendations will comprise the basis for a comprehensive report which the task force shall present to Governor Jon S. Corzine and the New Jersey Legislature in June 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public fora are meeting over the upcoming week; information about dates, times, and locations can be found &lt;a href="http://www.nj.gov/nj/community/features/news/approved/090306b.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Individuals who are unable to attend any of the fora can submit written testimony to &lt;a href="mailto:deborah.cohen@dhs.state.nj.us?subject=NJ%20Adults%20with%20Autism%20Task%20Force%20Testimony"&gt;deborah.cohen@dhs.state.nj.us&lt;/a&gt; by March 21, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can probably guess what the testimony I'm working on will be about based on what I write (over and over) here and have noted in &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/statements-to-the-iacc-and-what-happened-on-monday/"&gt;testimony to the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee&lt;/a&gt;---about the pressing need for housing, employment (including the need for training, job opportunities, and support staff for those who require it), transportation, and supports and services at appropriate levels throughout an individual's lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing about Charlie's needs is something I've had way too much practice in, and yet I often find myself returning to the same internal conflict. I have a pressing need to indicate the bare truth, the simple reality of how Charlie struggles and how an appropriate education, services, and staff can turn those struggles around. It's a meaningful struggle, Jim and I believe, for us as well as Charlie and even as we seek to convey that there's pain and sadness, we always have to emphasize how good we know life with Charlie is, and how desolate life would be without my strong-shouldered boy. It's a delicate balance to convey that there are tough days and, on those same days, you've having so much fun and everything is so full of love pure and simple that you feel your heart might burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, "accepting" that one's child is on the autism spectrum---acknowledging that one's child has a disability----gets equated with having "blinders" on, in a March 13th &lt;a href="http://www.ajc.com/opinion/content/opinion/stories/2009/03/13/polinged_0313.html"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Jon Poling. Dr. Poling is the father of &lt;a href="http://www.blisstree.com/autismvox/the-case-of-hannah-poling/"&gt;Hannah Poling&lt;/a&gt;, whose "'pre-existing mitochondrial disorder" was "conceded" to have been "'aggravated' by her shots" in March of 2008, just over two years ago. Such parents  who have "gone down the dead end path to autism acceptance, &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/10_autism_controversies"&gt;without search for cause or cure&lt;/a&gt;" (guess I get cast in this group, though please read what's said &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/once_upon_a_time_i_tried_to_recover_my_son_from_autism"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; too)---such parents are compared to those doctors who "still fail to even accept the increasing autism rate as real, rather than their own better diagnosis" and who think that "vaccines should be exonerated in the autism epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disputes about causes, treatments, definitions, and much more of autism are sure to rage on. But for every time we bring these up (as I am here), what if we talked too about what individuals on the spectrum need and need now, in a very specific and concrete sense?  Sure we can talk abut needing a cure----for failing school programs that are understaffed and simply unprepared for students on all parts of the autism spectrum; for a lack of good options for housing for adults with disabilities; for a positive deficit of jobs for adults with disabilities and for adequate protections against &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/no_talking_turkey_exploitation_of_disabled_workers"&gt;abuses by employers&lt;/a&gt;; for ending the use of seclusion rooms, restraints and aversives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the last topic, here's an email about something you can do to make real, and really needed, change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.gao.gov/"&gt;Government Accountability Office&lt;/a&gt; (GAO), Congress' investigative arm, is seeking information about the use of restraints, seclusion, and aversives in day school programs. The GAO will be developing a report in preparation for hearings to be held by House Education Committee Chairman George Miller on the issue. Day schools are schools that are not residential. The GAO is interested in all kinds of cases, civil and criminal, cases in court and cases in due process/other administrative hearings. In addition, COPAA is collecting information about situations that didn't involve court or hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CATEGORY ONE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Cases, Hearings, Criminal and Civil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Please provide the following information to Christine A. Hodakievic, GAO Senior Special Agent, email: &lt;a href="mailto:HodakievicC@gao.gov"&gt;HodakievicC@gao.gov&lt;/a&gt;. We would also appreciate a copy to us at &lt;a href="mailto:jessica@copaa.org"&gt;jessica@copaa.org&lt;/a&gt; but that is not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Information about any Court case, due process hearing or other administrative hearing involving restraints, seclusion, or aversives in a day school program. It does not have to be an IDEA case. It can be any kind of case, such as Constitutional, wrongful death or other tort action, 504, or any other kind of case/hearing. It can be a litigated case or a case that was filed and settled or otherwise concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Information about any Criminal Matter involving restraint, seclusion, or aversives in a school. This can be a criminal case that went to a trial, a criminal case resolved without a trial, an indictment, an information, arrest, or any other kind of criminal matter. (Some of you have represented children who were witnesses in criminal cases against school staff who used aversive interventions. The GAO would be interested in these criminal cases, as well as others.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Information about complaints filed with a State Department of Education about restraints, seclusion, or aversives in a day school program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[****INFO ADDED SINCE ORIGINAL E-MAIL*****]&lt;br&gt;
In order to ease the burden on the GAO, and to make the reporting even easier, Council of Parent Attorneys &amp;amp; Advocates, Inc. (COPAA) has developed [a] reporting form. Please submit any information about hearings, litigation, criminal or civil cases, state complaints, or other legal proceedings involving restraints, seclusion, or aversives.  The information will then be sent to the GAO twice a week compiled together in a single Excel spreadsheet.  Your information WILL go to the GAO, but it will simply be in a more easy to use form, and the GAO officer will not be facing a mailbox crammed with email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow the GAO to concentrate on the substance of its work instead of being inundated with email.  If you wish to send your reports directly to the GAO, or your organization has instructed you to do so, we do not mean to interfere with those instructions.  But emails are circulating widely on the internet via various yahoo groups giving contact information for the GAO, and you may find it more fruitful to use COPAA's reporting form instead.  If you have a choice, we'd suggest using COPAA's form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To complete the reporting form about hearings, civil cases, criminal cases, litigation, state complaints, or other legal proceedings involving the use of restraints, seclusion, or aversives on children with disabilities, click on &lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=w1TBGjlJhZUsC9Nmz2HwnA_3d_3d"&gt;Legal Report Form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that does not work, then the full link is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=w1TBGjlJhZUsC9Nmz2HwnA_3d_3d"&gt;http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=w1TBGjlJhZUsC9Nmz2HwnA_3d_3d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out only the information you wish to complete.  If, due to client confidentiality concerns, you can only fill in your name, email address, state, and provide a very general description of the events, then do so.  On the other hand, if you can provide a fuller description, we would appreciate it.&lt;br&gt;
*****END OF ADDED INFO*****&lt;br&gt;
In your email to the GAO, it would be very helpful to describe the case, provide any identifying information such as a citation, describe what happened to the child, what happened in the case/hearing/complaint, and any other pertinent information. If you know whether the case is still pending or whether civil litigation has ended, please add that. The GAO would also appreciate receiving copies of complaints, hearing notices, pleadings, briefs, and decisions/orders, if you would like to provide them (its optional). Obviously, if you have a big case file, choose the most important documents. If you filed a complaint with your State Department of Education, but didn't file a court case or due process, please be very clear about that in your email to the GAO. It helps them sort out what they are getting, since they will be receiving many many emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CATEGORY 2&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Other Situations--no filed case or hearing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
COPAA is also seeking information about any other situations in which children were subject to restraints, seclusion, or aversives but a case or due process/administrative hearing was not filed. We have set up a computerized survey form for you to report it. We will be sharing this information with the GAO and as otherwise explained in the survey. This computerized form simply allows us to collect all of the information together and sort it so that we can do this quickly. If you wish to complete the survey, click &lt;a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=kbizom_2bCU27wrYCCRv7R7w_3d_3d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
(If the link doesn't work, the full link is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION IN WHICH A COURT CASE, HEARING, CRIMINAL COMPLAINT, or other litigation, court filing, or case ensued, please report it directly to the GAO as stated in Category 1. Please use the COPAA survey form only for other situations in which restraints, seclusion, or aversives were used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you and feel free to contact us with any other questions. Again, please feel free to repost or otherwise share this information with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many may already know, Dr. Poling (a neurologist) is the father of &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?cat=80"&gt;Hannah Poling&lt;/a&gt;, a petitioner in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program whose case was conceded by the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, Department of Health and Human Services (DVIC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, DVIC has concluded that the facts of this case meet the statutory criteria for demonstrating that the vaccinations CHILD received on July 19, 2000, significantly aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder, which predisposed her to deficits in cellular energy metabolism, and manifested as a regressive encephalopathy with features of autism spectrum disorder. Therefore, respondent recommends that compensation be awarded to petitioners in accordance with 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-11(c)(1)(C)(ii).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/02/full-text-autis.html"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, Hannah Poling’s case was conceded, but contrary to popular internet re-interpretations which claim a court “decision” about autism causation, the case was apparently never actually heard by the court - and no court ruling about whether or not Hannah’s autistic features were caused by vaccination was ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, there have been a number of reports in the media concerning a certain Vaccine Act case, currently pending before the court. Some of those reports have erroneously stated that the Office of the Special Masters has recently issued a “decision,” “opinion,” or “ruling” concerning the issue of whether a Vaccine Act claimant’s autism symptoms were caused by one or more vaccinations. The OSM has not issued any such decision, ruling or opinion. (All Vaccine Act decisions and opinions are posted on the Court’s web site at www.uscourts.gov/vaccine-opinions-decisions) Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 300aa=12(d)(4)(A), officials of this court are generally prohibited from revealing any information concerning vaccine Act case, until a written decision concerning the case has been issued. Accordingly we cannot provide any details concerning this matter at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uscfc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/autism/Autism%20Update%203%2027%2008.pdf"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Source&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the background &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/02/incredible_shrinking_causation_claim.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/176"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So fast-forward a year or so, and find Dr. Jon Poling on a public soapbox. I’ll listen for a couple of minutes. Okay, I’d better fess up here. I’m going to employ the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler&amp;#39;s_fallacy"&gt;gambler’s fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, and hope, just like watching the first couple of minutes of an infomercial, that this time, there’s going to be something good, interesting, or, at least, something new to be learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ll give this Op-Ed three “strikes” as I read through it, and see how far this takes us. Logical fallacy and misinformation, among other possibilities, will count as “strikes”.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraphs 1-2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the million plus American families touched by autism, like mine, there is real urgency to find scientific answers to help loved ones and prevent future victims. Unfortunately, some doctors still fail to even accept the increasing autism rate as real, rather than their own better diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collateral damage of “better diagnosis,” the idea that we are simply better at detecting autism, is the abandonment of families coping with autism by the medical establishment, government and private insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straw-Zilla - Strike One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who claims “better diagnosis” is solely responsible for the increase in autism diagnoses over the past couple of decades is pretty likely to be fairly &lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=96"&gt;scientifically illiterate&lt;/a&gt;. Writing to suggest that this may embody any representative scientific consensus, is nothing more than construction of a giant &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw-man"&gt;straw man&lt;/a&gt; argument.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraph 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the high emotional toll autism takes on a family, many have been financially ruined. Public school systems are drowning in the red ink of educating increasing numbers of special-needs students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullshit! - Strike Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=297"&gt;Increasing numbers of special needs students&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.autismstreet.org/images/blog/2009jan/california1.jpg" alt="Increase in special needs students - California"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paragraphs 4-5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the ‘better diagnosis’ myth has been soundly debunked. In the 2009 issue of Epidemiology, two authors analyzed 1990 through 2006 California Department of Developmental Services and U.S. Census data documenting an astronomical 700 to 800 percent rise in the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These scientists concluded that only a smaller percentage of this staggering rise can be explained by means other than a true increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey, did they really conclude that? - Strike Three&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the scientists actually concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism incidence in California shows no sign yet of plateauing. Younger ages at diagnosis, differential migration, changes in diagnostic criteria, and inclusion of milder cases do not fully explain the observed increases. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other artifacts have yet to be quantified, and as a result, the extent to which the continued rise represents a true increase in the occurrence of autism remains unclear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry folks, my attention span just ran out, and I’m changing the channel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Do'C</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism Street</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236925765455"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=406">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9d806bfa2acdaa7b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clinical Trials"/><category term="Health Fraud"/><category term="Pharmaceuticals"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Scientific Fraud Hits Home</title><published>2009-03-13T06:00:48Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T06:00:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=406" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week the &lt;a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?ses=ogst&amp;amp;section_id=3&amp;amp;show=dept&amp;amp;article_id=12634"&gt;story broke&lt;/a&gt; that Scott Reuben, an anesthesiologist and clinical researcher at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, MA, had falsified data in at least 21 publications over a period of at least 12 years—making it one of the most enduring examples of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct#Cases_of_alleged_scientific_misconduct_and_related_incidents"&gt;scientific fraud&lt;/a&gt; in memory. Almost all of Reuben’s papers had reported innovative methods for providing post-operative pain relief (analgesia); many of them involved ‘multimodal’ regimens for painful orthopedic procedures such as spinal fusions and total knee replacements. Recent papers reported regimens that included celecoxib (Celebrex) and pregabalin (Lyrica), both made by Pfizer. Much of Reuben’s research had been funded by Pfizer, and Reuben has been a member of the Pfizer speaker’s bureau (that information is included because the reader would otherwise wonder, but there is no indication that Pfizer has been intentionally involved in Reuben’s fraud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not discuss this case in detail; look for a more comprehensive piece on SBM next week. Rather, I present it now to offer a local example of how such a breach of trust affects those who rely on clinical research to inform their care of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case hit home in a couple of ways. Although SBM readers may think of me as one of the 10 or so most knowledgeable skeptics of pseudomedicine in the entire world, in my day job I am a practicing anesthesiologist in Massachusetts. A big problem in anesthesia and surgery is how to provide adequate pain relief for patients after especially painful operations, without having to use such high doses of narcotics that many, particularly the elderly, will become somnolent and have depressed respiratory drives. The issue thus involves both comfort and safety. Multimodal regimens such as those reported by Reuben seemed to offer one solution, and have become increasingly popular over the past couple of years. Reuben gave a talk on the subject to my anesthesia department about a year ago. I’m sorry to say that I wasn’t there, but my colleagues remember him as having seemed utterly normal. No surprise, in a way; that’s what it takes to fly under the radar for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife, a nurse practitioner, is one of the voices of pain management at our hospital. She’s given many talks and made many recommendations about multimodal analgesia—based predominantly, as it turns out, on Reuben’s ‘work’. The hospital pharmacy agreed to put the expensive Lyrica on its formulary after a formal plea from my wife and a couple of my anesthesia colleagues. Upheaval now reigns, and my wife feels deceived and embarrassed. The timing couldn’t be worse: money’s tighter than it’s ever been. It’s Madoff writ small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which, further, leads to this irony: there’s enough plausibility, and a bit of corroborating clinical research, to suggest that Reuben’s fraud notwithstanding, the multimodal regimen might be useful. The collective clinical impression at our hospital, where we do 20-30 total joint replacements and 10-15 spinal fusions every week, is that it has made a big difference. Have we merely been fooling ourselves in the same way that sCAMsters do, or does the stuff really work? This is important enough that at least some Reubenesque studies need to be repeated, minus the data fabrication. And who will pay for them? Yup, you guessed it. What else is new, my friend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we’re talking about doing a study. If we do we’ll almost certainly ask Pfizer to fund it, even though that would be far from ideal. Pfizer has the money, the motivation, and the still-valid protocols from previous, misreported studies. It is also an obvious source of sham facsimiles of its own drugs (placebos). The alternative—starting from scratch and applying for a grant from the NIH, for example—would be prohibitively cumbersome for busy clinicians, and not at all guaranteed. Maybe the NIH itself will do a study, but don’t hold your breath. Man, I just don’t understand what’s goin’ on.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that Prince Charles has a detractor in one Edzard Ernst, the UK's "first professor of complementary medicine." The scion of the royal family has long supported unproven remedies, and Ernst is appalled at one particular product. The item in question, &lt;a href="http://www.duchyoriginals.com/detox_tincture.php"&gt;Duchy Herbal Detox Tincture&lt;/a&gt;, is heartily endorsed by Prince Charles. It's also of note that Duchy donates money to Prince Charles' charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Duchy's site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Detox Tincture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duchy Herbals Detox Tincture is made from extracts of Artichoke and Dandelion, cleansing and purifying herbs to help support the body's natural elimination and detoxification processes, and help maintain healthy digestion. Duchy Herbals Detox Tincture can be taken as part of a regular detox program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globe artichoke, which has the Latin name &lt;em&gt;Cynara scolymus&lt;/em&gt;, is a thistle - like perennial plant originating from Africa. It is easily recognised by its large green leaves and attractive purple flowers. Its is a well known vegetable that can be used in a variety of different dishes, and is also a well known digestive aid.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236921478415"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2506">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44d2d27748cf37a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Future Technology"/><category term="Robots"/><title type="html">Robot Responds To Human Gestures</title><published>2009-03-13T05:10:01Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T05:10:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/12/robot-responds-to-human-gestures/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2009/03/090311085058.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2009/03/090311085058.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="247"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090311085058.htm"&gt;Scientists have demonstrated how a robot can follow nonverbal commands &lt;/a&gt;from a person in a variety of environments — indoors as well as outside — all without adjusting for lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have created a novel system where the robot will follow you at a precise distance, where you don’t need to wear special clothing, you don’t need to be in a special environment, and you don’t need to look backward to track it,” said Chad Jenkins, assistant professor of computer science at Brown University and the team’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, Brown graduate students use a variety of hand-arm signals to instruct the robot, including “follow,” “halt,” “wait” and “door breach.” For much of the time, a student walks with his or her back to the robot, turning corners in narrow hallways and walking briskly in an outdoor parking lot. Throughout, the robot dutifully follows, maintaining an approximate three-foot distance, even backing up when a student turns around and approaches it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You might find a lot of competition but ultimately you’d have the means of starting repopulation. &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2009/03/gay-ducks-kill-species.html"&gt;Now what if the 2 guys were gay? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that seems to be the issue with Ben and Jerry, 2 of the last 3 New Zealand Blue Ducks in the world. They’ve got a female, Cherry, but they’re far too into each other to touch her. Anyone else think that if there was a third male it the group, he’d be named “Garcia?” Come on, guys! Take one for the team and get it on with this chick. She’s available and desperate, and you’re the only game in town. Haven’t you guys ever fantasized about a threesome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real loser here is Cherry, who has expressed sexual interest in Jerry, though she’s been ignored. If anyone’s looking to score with a desperate female blue duck, you know where to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For now he’s to spend the next 20 years in jail after the country’s highest court ruled against him – without even hearing his defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What did he do to warrent such punishment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, almost 18 months after he was arrested for allegedly circulating an article about women’s rights, any hope of justice and due process evaporated amid gross irregularities, allegations of corruption and coercion at the Supreme Court. Justices issued their decision in secret, without letting Mr Kambaksh’s lawyer submit so much as a word in his defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right. The punishment for promoting women’s rights is death. This is precisely the kind of backwardness that illustrates why Islam must be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

This first story got us thinking that &lt;a href="http://blogs.courant.com/roger_catlin_tv_eye/2009/03/did-seinfeld-episode-predict-c.html"&gt;maybe Seinfeld was right&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monkeys are really the end of the line in the pet world. I think when you’re at the monkey level of pet ownership, have a kid. I mean, come on, you know, I mean, you’re so close. If you need a pet that can roller skate and smoke cigars, it’s time to think about a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/on_being_human.php"&gt;Santino the chimpanzee rebelled against his human captors&lt;/a&gt; by hurling rocks at them. And now a &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/4970905/Monkey-kills-cruel-owner-with-coconut-thrown-from-tree.html"&gt;monkey kills his slave-driving owner with a coconut&lt;/a&gt;, once again confirming that coconuts kill more people each year than sharks (That’s actually a fact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe his behaviour is the strongest proof yet that humans are not the only creatures which can make plans for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the immortal words of Charlton Heston:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your stinkin’ paws off me you damned, dirty ape!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The &lt;a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/articles/2009/03/12/1236447376612.html"&gt;latest weird story of animals attacking&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Indonesian villager had to be rushed to hospital after a horse bit off one of his testicles during a freak attack.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The 35-year-old man was unloading sand from a horse-drawn cart at a construction site in Sulawesi earlier this week when the attack occurred, Indonesia's state-run news agency Antara reported.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A witness said the animal suddenly lunged at the man, sinking its teeth into his crotch.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Shocked bystanders loaded the man into a car to take him to hospital, before one noticed a piece of flesh on the pavement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Luckily the horse did not chew up or swallow his testicle, but spit it onto the pavement," the bystander was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last little detail just hammers home the contempt that horse had for the human. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So…is about half my readership cringing and doubling over in sympathetic agony right now?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/they_are_out_to_get_us.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/3x8VQC-bjzc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236918832253"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_107th_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fafad75f479fa747</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">The 107th Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle: OMG!

&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;a href="http://podblack.com"&gt;PodBlack Cat&lt;/a&gt; on March 26. Start firing up your skeptical keyboards and be sure to give her the material she needs for yet another awesome carnival!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we're always--and I do mean &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;--on the lookout for hosts, both those who've hosted before and newbie skeptical bloggers who want their chance to make a mark on the blogosphere. It's one thing that helped get my blog off the ground, and it could for yours too.

It’s an essay written by Michael Spencer. And who is this Michael Spencer?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;Michael Spencer is a writer and communicator living and working in a Christian community in Kentucky. He describes himself as “a postevangelical reformation Christian in search of a Jesus-shaped spirituality.” This essay is adapted from a series on his blog, &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://internetmonk.com/"&gt;InternetMonk.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Spencer, the evangelical community in the United States will self-destruct within 10 years. I would have guessed it’d take a whole generation, but I prefer Spencer’s time table. Spencer further adds,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two generations, evangelicalism will be a house deserted of half its occupants. (Between 25 and 35 percent of Americans today are Evangelicals.) In the “Protestant” 20th century, Evangelicals flourished. But they will soon be living in a very secular and religiously antagonistic 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course them he calls what will follow as anti-Christian “intolerance” as if being intolerant of bad ideology built on lies and deceit is some form of bigotry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Evangelicals will quit. Thousands of ministries will end. Christian media will be reduced, if not eliminated. Many Christian schools will go into rapid decline. I’m convinced the grace and mission of God will reach to the ends of the earth. But the end of evangelicalism as we know it is close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;YES! YES! YES! DON’T STOP! YES! I could read Spencer write about this stuff all day. It’s like porn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though to be fair, the reasons he sees for this collapse and thus the behavior I think he’s trying to condemn is much of the reasons I condemn religion: linking their movement with the culture war and political conservatism, lack of education about what the actual scriptures say, and preaching to the choir both proverbially and literally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the best line of the essay has to be under the section labeled “Is all of this a bad thing?”:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evangelicalism doesn’t need a bailout. Much of it needs a funeral. But what about what remains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Couldn’t agree me.  Same goes for this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it a good thing that many marginal believers will depart? Possibly, if churches begin and continue the work of renewing serious church membership. We must change the conversation from the maintenance of traditional churches to developing new and culturally appropriate ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I actually like this guy.&lt;/p&gt;

April 5 is the first day of a class I'm teaching called Social Technology, in which we are focusing on designing an exhibition that features social objects, that is, exhibits or artifacts that inspire interpersonal dialogue.

&lt;p&gt;To kick off the course, we're doing a simple exercise at the Seattle zoo (but you can do it anywhere). The experiment requires you to go to a public space and do three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   1. Talk to a stranger.&lt;br&gt;
   2. Get two strangers talking to each other.&lt;br&gt;
   3. Make and install an object or condition which motivates two strangers to talk to each other without your intervention/involvement. That is, you should be able to watch the strangers talk to each other about the designed social object you have created without being directly involved in the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this experiment is to play with design conditions that support both facilitated and unfacilitated engagement with strangers. This is something I am obsessively curious about. And while I've been exploring venues, situations, and apparel that serve as social objects, I've found few examples of explicitly designed social objects. Most social objects that mediate conversation among strangers are incidental. For example, my dog, while a highly evolved social matchmaking device, is not deliberately designed for that task. I believe that focusing specifically on the social capacity of an object, rather than its content or interpretation, yields new design techniques for museum exhibits and other participatory spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three reasons you might value this activity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   1. It will be fun and kind of unusual.&lt;br&gt;
   2. It will help you understand the challenges involved in supporting user self-expression.&lt;br&gt;
   3. It will help you develop ways to encourage inter-visitor dialogue and engagement around objects in your institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are three reasons I'd really value your participation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   1. I want to suck your brain and revel in your inventiveness.&lt;br&gt;
   2. I want to aggregate all the data, synthesize it and share it. More data means more interesting, nuanced conclusions for everyone.&lt;br&gt;
   3. I want to connect these students to a larger group of people interested in exploring topics around social technology in museums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to participate, please leave a comment here or send me an email at nina@museumtwo.com. You don't have to be a museum person or have any qualifications beyond your interest in participating and documenting your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend performing the experiment with friends or family to enhance both the fun and safety of the activities. Do not use plunk your cute baby down in the park, walk away, and call it a social object. You have to actually design something--a sign, an incident, an object, an environment. It's ok if you fail as long as you try. We'll learn as much from the social objects that don't work as from the ones that are astounding successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants will be asked to write up their experiences (photos/video enthusiastically supported!), which will all be featured on a dedicated website. We'll also be live-twittering the experiment on April 5 using the hashtag #strangemuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll produce a report that will be shared here on the Museum 2.0 blog. And if you happen to be in the Seattle area, I invite you to join us for a post-experiment dinner on April 5, location TBD (suggestions welcome).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about it? Ready for a stranger April? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

His brand is Duchy Originals and it has produced numerous herbal and detox preparations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Ernst, the first professor of complementary medicine in the UK, said: “Prince    Charles contributes to the ill health of the nation by pretending we can all    overindulge, then take his tincture and be fine again. Under the banner of    holistic and integrative health care he thus promotes a ‘quick fix’ and    outright quackery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said detox is based on the idea that toxins accumulate in the body until it    becomes overloaded and that certain products can speed up the elimination of    these substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof Ernst said: “The body has a powerful mechanism to deal with itself    and there’s no evidence that dandelion or artichoke will improve these    functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Scott S. Reuben, MD, of Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., a pioneer in the area of multimodal analgesia, is said to have fabricated his results in at least 21, and perhaps many more, articles dating back to 1996. The confirmed articles were published in Anesthesiology, Anesthesia and Analgesia, the Journal of Clinical Anesthesia and other titles, which have retracted the papers or will soon do so, according to people familiar with the scandal (see list). The journals stressed that Dr. Reuben's co-authors on those papers have not been accused of wrongdoing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more about it in &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/health/research/11pain.html?_r=1" title=""&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123672510903888207.html" title=""&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sayed Pervez Kambaksh, the student journalist sentenced to death for blasphemy in Afghanistan, has been told he will spend the next 20 years in jail after the country's highest court ruled against him - without even hearing his defence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It later emerged he was convicted by three mullahs, in secret, without access to a lawyer. The sentence was commuted to 20 years on appeal. At that appeal, in October, the key prosecution witness withdrew his testimony, claiming he had been forced to lie on pain of death. The prosecution then appealed to the Supreme Court to reinstate the death sentence. The defence appealed to quash his conviction altogether.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, the student has been languishing in a Kabul jail, fearing for his life. Islamic fundamentalists have been baying for his blood while moderate groups have led marches countrywide demanding his release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was his crime? This is as bad as the criminality of the kangaroo court that convicted him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Kambaksh was found guilty of blasphemy and sentenced to death last year for circulating an essay on women's rights which questioned verses in the Koran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't question. Don't support women. We'll kill you if you do either. Is that the message?&lt;/p&gt;

Sharing these actions with the change.org community through the Actions page is a way in addition to taking the actions yourself that you can help to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236910238306"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2490">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de5bdbe670f1d7ad</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cults"/><category term="Anonymous"/><category term="John Travolta"/><category term="KESQ-TV"/><category term="Scientology"/><category term="Tom Cruise"/><category term="Tommy Davis"/><title type="html">KESQ-TV in Palm Springs reveals the true face of $cientology</title><published>2009-03-13T02:09:07Z</published><updated>2009-03-13T02:09:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/12/kesq-tv-in-palm-springs-reveals-the-true-face-of-cientology/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the first in their 5-part series on the cult.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me at all knows that I break down creationist biology into four main components: design, natural evil, systematics, speciation, and biogeography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sentence alone is just a marvel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the whole thing, though, and you'll laugh and laugh. He tries to justify all those "well-designed" predators like venomous snakes, and all he's got is the usual creationist answer to all those nasty critters. The Fall. The Curse. God had to do an &lt;i&gt;amazing&lt;/i&gt; redesign act after Eve bit that apple.&lt;/p&gt;

The topic sounds historically, philosophically, and scientifically interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Dawkins suggests that there are four "bridges to evolutionary understanding" and illustrates this with four claimants to the discovery of natural selection: Edward Blyth, Patrick Matthew, Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The fifth bridge of evolutionary understanding is identified as modern genetics - which he terms digital Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story is of interest in part because of the scale of the deception -- not a paper or two, but perhaps dozens -- and in part because the scientist's area of research, the treatment of pain, strikes a nerve with many non-scientists whose medical treatment may have been (mis-)informed by the fraudulent results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004823" title=""&gt;Cage Matching: Head to Head Competition Experiments of an Invasive Plant Species from Different Regions as a Means to Test for Differentiation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many hypotheses are prevalent in the literature predicting why some plant species can become invasive. However, in some respects, we lack a standard approach to compare the breadth of various studies and differentiate between alternative explanations. Furthermore, most of these hypotheses rely on 'changes in density' of an introduced species to infer invasiveness. Here, we propose a simple method to screen invasive plant species for potential differences in density effects between novel regions. Studies of plant competition using density series are a fundamental tool applied to virtually every aspect of plant population ecology to better understand evolution. Hence, we use a simple density series with substitution contrasting the performance of Centaurea solstitialis in monoculture (from one region) to mixtures (seeds from two regions). All else being equal, if there is no difference between the introduced species in the two novel regions compared, Argentina and California, then there should be no competitive differences between intra and inter-regional competition series. Using a replicated regression design, seeds of each species were sown in the greenhouse at 5 densities in monoculture and mixed and grown till onset of flowering. Centaurea seeds from California had higher germination while seedlings had significantly greater survival than Argentina. There was no evidence for density dependence in any measure for the California region but negative density dependence was detected in the germination of seeds from Argentina. The relative differences in competition also differed between regions with no evidence of differential competitive effects of seeds from Argentina in mixture versus monoculture while seeds from California expressed a relative cost in germination and relative growth rate in mixtures with Argentina. In the former instance, lack of difference does not mean 'no ecological differences' but does suggest that local adaptation in competitive abilities has not occurred. Importantly, this method successfully detected differences in the response of an invasive species to changes in density between novel regions which suggests that it is a useful preliminary means to explore invasiveness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004813" title=""&gt;Pre-Columbian Origins for North American Anthrax&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Disease introduction into the New World during colonial expansion is well documented and had a major impact on indigenous populations; however, few diseases have been associated with early human migrations into North America. During the late Pleistocene epoch, Asia and North America were joined by the Beringian Steppe ecosystem which allowed animals and humans to freely cross what would become a water barrier in the Holocene. Anthrax has clearly been shown to be dispersed by human commerce and trade in animal products contaminated with Bacillus anthracis spores. Humans appear to have brought B. anthracis to this area from Asia and then moved it further south as an ice-free corridor opened in central Canada ~13,000 ybp. In this study, we have defined the evolutionary history of Western North American (WNA) anthrax using 2,850 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 285 geographically diverse B. anthracis isolates. Phylogeography of the major WNA B. anthracis clone reveals ancestral populations in northern Canada with progressively derived populations to the south; the most recent ancestor of this clonal lineage is in Eurasia. Our phylogeographic patterns are consistent with B. anthracis arriving with humans via the Bering Land Bridge. This northern-origin hypothesis is highly consistent with our phylogeographic patterns and rates of SNP accumulation observed in current day B. anthracis isolates. Continent-wide dispersal of WNA B. anthracis likely required movement by later European colonizers, but the continent's first inhabitants may have seeded the initial North American populations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004865" title=""&gt;Identification and Gene Expression Analysis of a Taxonomically Restricted Cysteine-Rich Protein Family in Reef-Building Corals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The amount of genomic sequence information continues to grow at an exponential rate, while the identification and characterization of genes without known homologs remains a major challenge. For non-model organisms with limited resources for manipulative studies, high-throughput transcriptomic data combined with bioinformatics methods provide a powerful approach to obtain initial insights into the function of unknown genes. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel family of putatively secreted, small, cysteine-rich proteins herein named Small Cysteine-Rich Proteins (SCRiPs). Their discovery in expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries from the coral Montastraea faveolata required the performance of an iterative search strategy based on BLAST and Hidden-Markov-Model algorithms. While a discernible homolog could neither be identified in the genome of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, nor in a large EST dataset from the symbiotic sea anemone Aiptasia pallida, we identified SCRiP sequences in multiple scleractinian coral species. Therefore, we postulate that this gene family is an example of lineage-specific gene expansion in reef-building corals. Previously published gene expression microarray data suggest that a sub-group of SCRiPs is highly responsive to thermal stress. Furthermore, data from microarray experiments investigating developmental gene expression in the coral Acropora millepora suggest that different SCRiPs may play distinct roles in the development of corals. The function of these proteins remains to be elucidated, but our results from in silico, transcriptomic, and phylogenetic analyses provide initial insights into the evolution of SCRiPs, a novel, taxonomically restricted gene family that may be responsible for a lineage-specific trait in scleractinian corals.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_134.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/dyWvlF02FEE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236900339811"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-96088503557170302.post-4688389545612010280">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3e1ccb6eaff03f4c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Department of Health" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="complementary and natural healthcare council" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bad Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="ofquack" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="CNHC" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Department of Health response to CNHC letter</title><published>2009-03-12T21:55:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T23:31:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/03/department-of-health-response-to-cnhc.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/4688389545612010280/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=96088503557170302&amp;postID=4688389545612010280" title="19 Comments" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SYi_vOIiDCI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/yHa0GBCbN9Q/s200/ofquack.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px;width:200px;height:70px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XSCXYE5_zNo/SYi_vOIiDCI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/yHa0GBCbN9Q/s200/ofquack.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a month of patiently waiting for a response from Ben Bradshaw to &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/02/i-wish-to-register-complaint.html"&gt;a letter I wrote&lt;/a&gt; regarding the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (&lt;a href="http://www.ofquack.org.uk"&gt;OfQuack&lt;/a&gt;), I received a letter from Laurent Vaic, Correspondence Officer for Department of Health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My original letter can be found &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2009/02/i-wish-to-register-complaint.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After some pleasantries, the letter begins in earnest:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In your letter you ask about the efficacy of treatments. I should explain that the CNHC does not promote the efficacy of the therapies it represents. The question of whether or not they work is for those who choose to use the therapies to decide. Professional regulation, whether statutory or in this case, voluntary, is about protecting the public, not about the efficacy of the therapies involved. Registration will mean that a practitioner has met certain entry standards (for instance, has an accredited qualification) and subscribes to a set of professional standards. In this way, the public will have the reassurance that any registered practitioner they choose meets these criteria and that practitioners would be subject to fitness to practise procedures should they behave inappropriately.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my letter, I asked "How can the CNHC provide protection without knowledge of efficacy?". DoH is stating that it is up to the customer to decide whether the treatment works, and separates 'protecting the public' from 'treatment efficacy'. Remember that the &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=84"&gt;mission of the CNHC&lt;/a&gt; is to "support the use of complementary and natural healthcare as a uniquely positive, safe and &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;effective&lt;/span&gt; experience." Effective, but with no interest in efficacy. Yes, I know, I had to read again as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Personally, I would consider 'protecting the public' to cover stopping quacks from teaching that a &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/11/be-aware-of-who-you-believe-and-what.html"&gt;urine-press placed on the neck is a suitable treatment for thyroid cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but apparently that's fine, providing they don't &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1158786/My-marriage-destroyed-groping-therapist.html"&gt;touch you up&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question I posed hasn't been answered. Back to the letter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You also mention the minutes of a meeting of the Federal Regulatory Board of the CNHC held on 20 November 2008. Officials have contacted the CNHC following your letter to gain an understanding of the statement in the that meeting to which you refer.&lt;/blockquote&gt; And indeed, I can only refer to it, as those (assumed) same officials &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=89"&gt;removed the link from the CNHC webpage&lt;/a&gt; specifically for ... em ... putting the minutes on. Furthermore, it is my understanding that the Board meets once a quarter, so we are missing two sets of minutes. A quick quote from the &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=84"&gt;CNHC Missions and Values&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At all times CNHC will...lead clearly and responsibly, inspiring trust through integrity, transparency and equity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Transparency is important, but seemingly not in Quackville.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I understand from the CNHC that a board member suggested the possibility of using digital stories as a means of illustrating the positive side of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) professional regulation. The suggestion was that such stories could utilise people who use CAMs and who recognise the value of regulation, as well as CAM practitioners. The board member concerned told the board that digital stories could be used as part of reflective practice and, as such, may have a place in ongoing professional development. It was suggested that board members might want to look at the website of Pilgrim Projects since this company specialises in 'humanising healthcare' and that Pilgrim Projects' Patient Voices programme contains a selection of the stories the company has made in a variety of contexts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I don't speak bureacratese very well, so a chunk of the above paragraph left me slightly bewildered. Reflective practice, anyone? Digital stories? Do people really speak like that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I understand that the intention was to present this advice in the context described so that the board would gain a better insight into the kind of work that has been done and to ascertain whether they thought this form of 'storytelling' was appropriate for the CNHC to use at some time in the future. I further understand that these were preliminary discussions only and that no decisions were either asked for or made. Unfortunately, the minutes of the board meeting of 20 November 2008 were placed on the CNHC's website without having been approved by the board. The CNHC recognises that potential inaccurate representations of the debate could do considerable damage to the reputation of the CNHC's Board member and that of Patient Voices, neither of which was its intention.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mistakes have been made, and so minutes will be edited in future to ensure this doesn't happen again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last part of the letter provides contact information for CNHC should I require further clarification of the minutes. Actually, the actual minutes would be a start, but as I said above, they have disappeared from the website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No response on why the CNHC regards its mission as "to support the use of complementary and natural healthcare as a uniquely positive, safe and effective experience". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens if someone complains? From the CNHC's own &lt;a href="http://www.cnhc.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=5"&gt;document on Complaints&lt;/a&gt;, the CNHC complaint process is not designed to be punitive, with the maximum power of the Complaints procedure being that a practitioner can be removed from the register. Bear in mind it is a &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;voluntary&lt;/span&gt; register.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've already shown above that they are not great at keeping to their own standards. In addition, they have &lt;a href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/ofquack-is-deflated.html"&gt;already had a legal chill&lt;/a&gt; from the British Standards Institute for hijacking the 'kitemark', which they have had to remove from the CNHC website. &lt;a href="http://www.thinkhumanism.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;amp;t=2682&amp;amp;hilit=ofquack&amp;amp;start=40"&gt;Alan H at Think Humanism&lt;/a&gt; has also demonstrated a personal data conflict on the CNHC site; from the CNHC site on 'Your Privacy', it states:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;The Published Register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;CNHC will make part of your register entry available to any enquirer as part of the published register.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The public can inspect the following information on the online register:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    * Your full name&lt;br&gt;    * Your profession or practice discipline&lt;br&gt;    * Your approximate work location&lt;br&gt;    * Your registration number&lt;br&gt;    * Any restrictions imposed on your registration &lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your home address, contact details, date of birth and other data are not available to the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;(My bold)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare that to this page, which is a search of quacktitioners whose surname is &lt;a href="http://www.cnhcregister.org.uk/search/index.cfm"&gt;Harmer&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunate name for a 'health' practitioner, but no matter):&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Search by name&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You searched for harmer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suzanne Harmer&lt;br&gt;44 Moneybrannon Road, Aghadowey, County Londonderry BT51 4AA Northern Ireland, United Kingdom&lt;br&gt;Telephone: 07799 471235 Telephone: 07799 471235&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disciplines Massage Therapy Status Registered until 17/02/2010 &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm pretty sure this isn't the last of my OfQuack squawking, although it is tempting to forget about the whole thing as a waste of time, but I *really* begrudge tax-money being used to fund what appears to be a complete waste of energy with no obvious benefits to quacks or punters.&lt;br&gt;If anyone else can help interpret the letter (and suggest suitable responses - I'll be formulating over the next few days), please feel free to leave your thoughts and ideas below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-4688389545612010280?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236899116178"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1227">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7940801fccf7e5c2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">"Passive Voice" — 1397-2009 — R.I.P.</title><published>2009-03-12T23:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T23:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1227" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Passive voice&lt;/span&gt; is a grammatical term whose first use in English, according to the OED, was about 600 years ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;a1450&lt;/span&gt; (a1397) &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Prol. Old Test.&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Bible&lt;/span&gt; (Wycliffite, L.V.) (Cambr. Mm. II. 15) xv. 57 A participle of a present tens either preterit, of actif vois eithir passif, mai be resoluid into a verbe of the same tens and a coniunccioun copulatif.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't been able to find an image of the original passage, but EEBO produces an image of a version published in the 16th century, from p. 122 of John's Purvey's "The true copye of a prolog wrytten about two C. yeres paste by Iohn Wycklife",&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/WyclifePassif.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cited example clearly refers to the grammar of Latin, where the cognate term was &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;passiuus&lt;/span&gt;.  Whether in Latin or in English, the meaning of this term, the OED explains, is "Denoting, relating to, or using a voice of a transitive verb in which the subject undergoes the action of the verb".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In English, the passive voice usually consists of an auxiliary (freq. &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;; occas. also &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt;, etc.) plus the past participle of the verb; comparable formations are found in other modern European languages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In passive constructions, the word which would logically be the object under a corresponding active construction functions as the grammatical subject, while the logical subject either is absent or is represented in a prepositional phrase (e.g. the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;food was eaten&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;the food was eaten by them&lt;/span&gt; rather than &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;they ate the food&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite this long history, I'm afraid that the traditional sense of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;passive voice&lt;/span&gt; has died after a long illness. It has ceased to be; it's expired and gone to meet its maker, kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. It's an ex-grammatical term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its ghost walks in the linguistics literature and in the usage of a few exceptionally old-fashioned intellectuals. For everyone else, what &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;passive voice&lt;/span&gt; now means is "construction that is vague as to agency".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've documented this development in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+%22passive+voice%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;many previous posts&lt;/a&gt;. The latest evidence is from Kent Scheidegger, "&lt;a href="http://www.crimeandconsequences.com/crimblog/2009/03/the-passive-exonerative-voice.html"&gt;The Passive Exonerative Voice&lt;/a&gt;", 3/11/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I propose a new rule. A person caught in a misdeed should get zero or negative credit for an expression of remorse if expressed in the passive voice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass. has acute pain from its former chief of acute pain, Scott S. Reuben. Keith Winstein and David Armstrong &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB123672510903888207-lMyQjAxMDI5MzE2MTcxMjE1Wj.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in the WSJ that the &amp;quot;prominent Massachusetts anesthesiologist allegedly fabricated 21 medical studies that claimed to show benefits from painkillers like Vioxx and Celebrex….&amp;quot; Faking data is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; cardinal sin of science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"Dr. Reuben deeply regrets that this happened," said the doctor's attorney, Ingrid Martin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Excuse me, Dr. Reuben and Ms. Martin, but how did "this" just "happen"? Did fabricated data grow spontaneously on your flash drive?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dr. Reuben deeply regrets that this happened" is certainly an attempt to evade responsibility. But there's no &lt;em&gt;passive voice&lt;/em&gt; in sight, in the traditional sense of that term. In particular, the subordinated sentence "this happened" is the active-voice preterite form of the intransitive verb &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;happen&lt;/span&gt;. However, in the contemporary sense of "construction that is vague about agency", Ms. Martin is clearly guilty of using the passive voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've read any of the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+%22passive+voice%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;earlier posts cited above&lt;/a&gt;, you will have noticed that we've repeatedly been guilty of ordering this particular linguistic tide to retreat. This was foolish of us. As usual for such gestures, the only effect is to make us feel virtuous and superior in a depressive sort of way. We should know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll simply point out to Mr. Scheidegger that he could sharpen up his proposed rule by phrasing it so as to withhold credit for expressions of remorse that fail to accept responsibility, whatever the grammatical structures used.  This will avoid unfairly negative treatment of candid — if passive-voice — expressions of remorse like &amp;quot;I should be held fully responsible for trying to change the way people use the phrase &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;passive voice&lt;/span&gt;, and I&amp;#39;m mortified by the realization that I have been so foolish as to suppose that mere informative protest would affect anyone&amp;#39;s linguistic behavior&amp;quot;. This will also prevent legalistic cavils about whether to give credit to things like Ingrid Martin&amp;#39;s active-voice — though evasive — statement that Dr. Scott Reuben &amp;quot;deeply regrets that [fabrication of 21 medical studies] happened&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an extra — though tiny — benefit to Mr. Scheidegger personally, this modification will also prevent linguists and a few other pedants from feeling depressively superior to him.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236898985714"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/thoughts-on-breaking-news-and-twitter/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9f48c8f3d079cc30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="About this blog"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><title type="html">Thoughts on breaking news and Twitter</title><published>2009-03-12T22:59:37Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T22:59:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/thoughts-on-breaking-news-and-twitter/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The near hit of the ISS and a piece of space debris &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/breaking-small-but-finite-chance-iss-to-be-hit-by-debris/"&gt;was quite the sensation this morning&lt;/a&gt;. It’s given me some things to think about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/twitterlogo.jpg" alt="Twitter logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; First, &lt;a href="http://davep-astro.blogspot.com/2009/03/twittering-international-space-station.html"&gt;as DaveP points out&lt;/a&gt;, the mainstream news hardly even had time to put up a note about the potential collision until, in many cases, the whole thing was over. &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;Yet on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; we were right on top of it. I have Tweetdeck (a Twitter reader) always open on my Mac desktop, so I constantly see the feed. I saw &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/Nancy_A"&gt;Nancy Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; tweeting about it, and immediately started looking around for news (going to NASA TV helped). I started tweeting about it myself, and sending people Nancy’s way to get info too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, by a few minutes before the event itself, thousands of people on Twitter were already getting the blow-by-blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing happened in February with &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/15/texas-fireball-whats-known-so-far/"&gt;the Texas fireball&lt;/a&gt;. News on Twitter was flying about it shortly after the event. Remember, this happened just four days after the two satellites collided, so rumors flew that the fireball was a piece of the debris. I knew it wasn’t, and did my best to squelch that rumor. In this more recent ISS case, a few folks were speculating the debris might be from one of those satellites too, but it was quickly determined to be something else. That was never picked up by any big news service like the fireball was, so we avoided any rumors like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard of Twitter, I thought it was useless. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/04/20/gunman-at-nasas-johnson-space-center/"&gt;Then a gunman held two people hostage at Johnson Space Center&lt;/a&gt;, and I tweeted info as I heard it. People really liked that, so I started tweeting Shuttle launches and landings, and people liked that too. What I’ve discovered is that Twitter is an awesomely useful tool for rapid dissemination of information. And as we saw with the fireball, it sends out misinformation rapidly, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure what to do about that, except to try to have the ear of people with lots of followers, and send them the correct info. The more folks who hear it, the more who will &amp;quot;retweet&amp;quot; it, and the faster we can step on rumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s one problem with Twitter. But there’s another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice now I’ve received complaints that during these events, I tweet too much. That’s an interesting thing. We’re talking breaking news, and Twitter, we’ve seen, is profoundly useful in those situations. As news comes in, it gets out. Under normal circumstances, I don’t tweet that much, so that’s what people expect. When an event happens, though, I will increase my frequency by a factor of five or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see where that might irritate someone who follows me. But what can be done? I want to make sure that I’m getting information out as I find it out, and that means lots of updates. I certainly don’t want to tick anyone off, but what other choice is there? Ignore the news? That doesn’t work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m honestly at a loss. The Shuttle launches again in a few days, and I’ll be on Twitter reporting it if I can. I don’t expect a solution between now and then, but I welcome ideas. If you’re on Twitter and have thoughts, leave comments below, please. But not too many! That’s irritating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note added a bit later: I did get one public tweet from someone about doing it too much (MCPF&amp;amp;#153 Adam was just teasing me), but that’s not really what prompted this. I got some private messages after the Kepler launch (plus some from an old launch months ago) which spurred me into writing this.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update 2: &lt;a href="http://cathemeralthinking.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-does-twitter-mean-for-breaking.html"&gt;David Harris has some thoughts on this as well&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236898170404"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2949137147896720359">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ceb254771fce971b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Levels of Selection</title><published>2009-03-12T21:44:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T22:48:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/levels-of-selection.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2949137147896720359/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2949137147896720359" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> There&amp;#39;s an interesting article in the latest issue of New Scientist.

He was taken to jail in handcuffs and will likely spend the rest of his life in prison for pulling off a $65 billion Ponzi scheme. The tendrils of his deception have touched numerous people and organizations - wiping out personal fortunes, bankrupting charities, and probably leading to two suicides. Madoff is guilty of monumental sociopathic fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is perhaps a bigger fraud story in the news this week also - not bigger in dollars but in the betrayal of trust. Anesthesiologist Scott S. Reuben, MD, of Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, MA is being &lt;a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?ses=ogst&amp;amp;section_id=3&amp;amp;show=dept&amp;amp;article_id=12634"&gt;accused of fabricating data&lt;/a&gt; on 21 published studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuben has been a leading researcher into what is called multimodal analgesia, specifically for post-operative pain management. Essentially, rather than simply sedating patients with narcotics, Reuben advocated using non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgesics (NSAIDS, or aspirin-like drugs) and neuropathic pain agents, like pregabalin. His published research showed the efficacy of this multimodal approach, which has been widely embraced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraud came to light when Baystate could not find approval for human investigation to support two papers Reuben submitted last Spring. Essentially, he was presenting data that looked like he had performed research on human subjects, but there was no paperwork indicating that he had permission to do such research. It therefore came to light that this is because he never did the research - he just made up the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is typical is such cases, once fraud comes to light and people take a closer look at the individual there is more fraud under the surface. When Reuben’s body of published research is viewed with a suspicious eye it appears that he has produced an unlikely number of soundly positive studies. Most researchers, when chance rather than fraud is operating, will produce a mix of positive, negative, and equivocal studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Reuben has been accused of publication fraud. Evan Eckman, MD says his name was placed on two of Reuben’s papers even though he had no involvement with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end 21 of Reuben’s papers are considered likely fraudulent and have been or will soon be retracted by the journals who published them. None of his co-authors have been implicated in fraud, but I’m sure they are not happy about their affiliation with such fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the drugs that Reuben’s studies promoted are the COX2 inhibitor, Celebrex, and the neuropathic pain agent Lyrica - both produced by Pfizer, who partially funded Reuben’s research. Pfizer is not suspected of any wrongdoing, and they immediatly pulled any reference to Reuben’s studies from their promotional material when the fraud came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Madoff scandal, the tendrils of this fraud go far and deep.  Reuben’s research was influential in the acceptance of multimodal analgesia. This acceptance now has to be reconsidered. The fraud does not mean that these treatments are ineffective or that multimodal analgesia is not a good idea. It just means that researchers have to go back to square one and think through the remaining data. Many studies will have to be replicated. A possibly legitimate approach to pain control has now been tainted by this fraud, and there is a big mess for other researchers to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other anesthesiologists based their practice in part on Reuben’s data, which means patients were treated based upon fraudulent data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baystate has been hurt by this, as well as the publications that now have to retract published studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Betrayal of Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to patients, doctors, journals, and his institution - Reuben has betrayed science and science-based medicine. And that is perhaps the deepest cut of all. The implications of that aspect of his betrayal is impossible to measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science as a human endeavor depends upon honesty and transparency. Fraud like this cuts the heart out of the institution of science. It diminishes the very necessary trust that all scientific practitioners must place in the published research. It also diminishes the trust that the public places in the institutions of science. Further, the association with Big Pharma - while likely completely incidental in this case - will further fuel conspiracy theories and undermine faith in the medical profession as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we go from here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these stunning cases of scientific fraud come to light, such as the South Korean stem-cell fraud, it always raises the question of how to prevent such fraud from occurring in the future. I don’t think there is any system that can catch and eliminate all such fraud. There will always be a certain amount of fraud in science. But we want to minimize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current peer-review practices are not really designed to catch fraud. Most cases of fraud are brought to light because someone blows the whistle, or because of some glaring and stupid mistake on the part of the individual committing the fraud - such as submitting data from patients you never had permission to study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method for discovering fraud is that fraudulent work may not be in line with reality, and so it will not hold up to replication. A very famous fraud, that of Piltdown Man, was uncovered in this fashion. These fake pre-human fossils were out of step with later fossil discoveries, to the point that Piltdown Man was increasingly ignored as irrelevant to the real story of human evolution, and eventually just had to be reexamined and was indeed found to be fraudulent. By then the discovery of fraud was a relief, it meant paleontologists no longer had to account for the Piltdown anomaly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end replication is probably the best hedge against fraud in science. The downside is that it may take a long time to work out. In medicine this may mean that treatment decisions are based for years on bad data, until the system has a chance to work out the real story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly why I and others advocate for science-based medicine rather than just evidence-based medicine (although I see how this may seem counterintuitive at first). Science-based medicine considers prior plausibility, and recognizes the limitations of clinical evidence. Fraud is just one of many limitations of clinical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that when a finding does not make sense based upon prior plausibility the bar for evidence should be raised. This includes requiring independent replication as a hedge against fraud, or just incredibly sloppy research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to catch fraud is the to-good-to-be-true principle. If a researcher produces data that seems too clean, too good to be true and/or his research is always suspiciously positive, that should raise a red flag and prompt some review. The problem is there is no real mechanism for such review. Journals are typically only concerned with an individual study presented to them for publication - not the body of research by the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community may detect the suspicious pattern, by which I mean the author’s colleagues or their institution. However, this does not seem to catch fraud in most cases. As with this case, suspicious patterns only come to light in retrospect, after fraud was detected by some other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps major journals, or professional organizations, need to add a layer of fraud detection to their procedures. This may seem like an inquisition (and if abused could become one) but if it is handled carefully and transparently, legitimate researchers should have nothing to fear. The minor inconvenience such a process would produce, if it really works as an early detection system for scientific fraud, could increase the reliability and reputation of the scientific process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it must also be recognized that it is impossible to completey eliminate all fraud. It is part of any human system. Systemic efforts are necessary to minimize fraud, which should also be punished severely.  But we need to expect that it will crop up every now and then. And this further means we need to keep our skepticism at an appropriate level - considering the plausibility of any claim, and witholding judgement until new ideas are adequately replicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20wwln-freak-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;Unintended Consequences&lt;/a&gt; points out first the example of doctors finding the cost of accommodating prohibitively expensive, then the example of employers becoming so terrified of the law that they just avoid any situation where it would come into play,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu and Angrist found that when the A.D.A. was enacted in 1992, it led to a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers. How could this be? Employers, concerned that they wouldn’t be able to discipline or fire disabled workers who happened to be incompetent, apparently avoided hiring them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/the-price-of-disability-law/"&gt;The Price of Disability Law&lt;/a&gt; goes into more depth on the specific issue of medical care for people who use sign language interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auditory processing issues that might benefit from an interpreter or captioner aside, the issue particularly of doctors not wanting to work with autistic patients because of the (at times very real) cost to them is &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/disparities_in_access_to_health_care"&gt;a big problem&lt;/a&gt;.  Cost may not be direct in terms of needing to hire an interpreter, but indirect in needing to spend more time with the patient.  I'm also reminded of the barriers to health care in the U.S. experienced by all people who do not speak fluent English (perhaps we need more doctors who themselves know sign language, Spanish, or PECS?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More generally though, the idea of trying to weasel around the ADA and causing more discrimination in the process is disturbing.  Part ignorance (in the case of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/looking_to_light_dark_age_beliefs_about_workers_with_disabilities"&gt;employers thinking accommodations will cost them a lot&lt;/a&gt; or that they won't be able to discipline an employee) and part seriously broken systems (in the case of the U.S. medical system), there are obviously some areas in the real-world implementation of the ADA that need to be examined.  How can society do better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, everything is fine! The ISS is safe, and the astronauts are alive and back to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the story. Today at 16:39 (UT), a small piece of space debris passed by the International Space Station. Orbit predictions put it close enough to the ISS to be a real danger, though the actual collisions odds were low. Astronauts closed all the hatches in the station and moved to the Soyuz escape module to wait it out. After the debris passed safely, they emerged, opened up all the hatches, and got back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still not known as I write this just how close the debris passed. It was a piece of a used booster called a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_Assist_Module"&gt;Payload Assist Module&lt;/a&gt;, a device used to boost satellites from low Earth orbit up to geosynchronous orbit. Robert Pearlman from &lt;a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum30/HTML/000779.html"&gt;CollectSpace&lt;/a&gt; told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This object is the “yo weight” from a Delta PAM-D stage (used to launch GPS 37 in 1993). The yo weight is a small mass attached to a 1-meter-long cable, used to tumble the stage after separation from the payload so it doesn’t recontact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass is probably less than 1 kg, but because it’s basically a piece of string, the cross-section is large for its mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1 kg mass moving at a relative speed of several kilometers per second could have done vast damage to the ISS, especially since it was not compact like a chunk of metal, but extended. It could have torn a huge hole in the station, and I imagine the astronauts are breathing a huge sigh of relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news here is that this object, though small, was tracked well enough to give the astronauts on the ISS plenty of time to evacuate… and don’t overlook the fact that the astronauts did a great job handling the situation (whereas I would be very busy screaming and wetting myself). This was an extraordinary event handled by extraordinary people. My sincere thanks to those who took care of it, and congratulations as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, my thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/12/iss-crew-may-need-to-evacuate-possible-debris-hit/"&gt;Nancy Atkinson of Universe Today&lt;/a&gt; for breaking this story and updating Twitter so fervently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my original post on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nancy Atkinson is on top of the story that &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2009/03/12/iss-crew-may-need-to-evacuate-possible-debris-hit/"&gt;a small piece of orbital debris might hit the space station&lt;/a&gt; at 11:39 Central (US) time, less than 40 minutes from the time I write this. Astronauts on board are preparing for this potential impact. Follow &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/Nancy_A"&gt;her Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt; for more info. You can also watch &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ntv"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt; for info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236873952094"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/shuttle-launch-delayed-until-march-15-at-least/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3bc8a763e1152c55</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Shuttle launch delayed until March 15 at least</title><published>2009-03-12T15:30:47Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T15:30:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/12/shuttle-launch-delayed-until-march-15-at-least/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The STS-119 mission launch has been delayed at least a few days due to a hydrogen leak in a vent line. The Shuttle is in no danger according to NASA, but things like this bedevil the complicated launch process, and they want to make sure everything is OK. A team of inspectors will take a look this afternoon to assess what’s what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’ll be 19:43 (Eastern time) on March 15th at the earliest for the next launch, and historically leaks like this take a while to sort out, so that target time and date may be optimistic. We’ll know better later today or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236873463568"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4977">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f15a887a0087b745</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Bernie Madoff"/><title type="html">Profits of Doom</title><published>2009-03-12T15:55:04Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T15:55:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/GEI1gZOdO2I/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/profits-of-doom/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">| Bernie Madoff pleaded guilty to securities fraud today.

Are these fears justified? Can we all right now decide to commit ourselves to the separation of &lt;em&gt;churches and state &lt;/em&gt;in advance of who wins this cultural war? &lt;strong&gt;Will that help assuage our respective fears?&lt;/strong&gt; In hopes this could help I do. I strongly affirm the separation of &lt;em&gt;churches and state&lt;/em&gt;.  And although atheism is not a church nor a religion I strongly affirm that there should be no anti-religious test for state office and that no one should teach or affirm atheism in our schools, nor that words like "We Are a Godless Nation" replace the words "In God We Trust" on our currency (even if we would remove the present words off our bills), etc. etc.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-7201661637828737839?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Many Icelanders really believe in "hidden people" such that it would be "political suicide" if a politician denied their existence. And what's more I doubt very much I could ever persuade these believers they are deluded. They would scoff at me and claim I'm an "enemy of the common good." They know they're right because of the stories told to them or because they had some kind of strange experience which they claim could only have come because they exist. Their children are brainwashed to believe in them in their homes. But I have no doubt at all that these Icelander believers are just like other people around the world, intelligent people. They just see the world through a different set of glasses using the lens they were brought up to believe. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parallel:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many Americans believe in a three-in-one-God along with hidden angels and evil spirits who exist in the land such that it would be "political suicide" if a politician denied their existence. And what's more I doubt very much I could ever persuade these believers they are deluded. They scoff at me and claim I'm an "enemy of the common good."

There are elves, light-fairies, hidden people, dwarfs, gnomes, and mountain spirits. Icelandic elves, for example, can have long, spindly legs, big ears, or crazy hair but they don’t wear pointed hats or shoes. Such garb is found on an Icelandic dwarf, perhaps, but he could just as well be wearing a long cloak or a beard. Hidden people are dressed like old-time, country folk, even though these same hidden people have been known to label us regular mortals as the "primitive" ones. In fact, there are so many variations that an entire flora has been described: 13 types of elves, 3 kinds of hidden people (including the Blue People), 4 varieties of gnomes, 2 forms of trolls, and 3 types of fairies. The school is located in Reykjavík, the country's largest city. The school is headed by Magnús Skarphéðinsson, brother of the leader of one of Iceland's largest political parties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, 54% of Icelanders believe in elves and hidden people and a full 90% of the population "takes notice" of this shadow community, which is said to number anywhere from 7000 to 20,000 inhabitants. "Take notice" is no small matter, it turns out, as Magnus illustrates with a rock on the side of the road outside Reykjavik. Don’t dismiss the last part of my statement; "on the side of the road" is the essential part of this story, for the entire multi-lane highway was delayed while the &lt;i&gt;Public Roads Administration&lt;/i&gt; gingerly moved this rock, said to be owned by dwarfs, out of the construction zone. There was even a time when the road works employed its own folklorist, to help deal with issues such as misplaced elves or soon-to-be-homeless hidden folk, who have been known to resort to sabotage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s not difficult to imagine how a belief in a hidden life or fairy people could have developed here. This is a land of stark, virtually unexplainable contrasts where conditions have long been harsh and the need for diversion obvious. Iceland experienced an extended &lt;i&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/i&gt; which kept the people in such dire straits that the average Icelander did not encounter the wheel until a mere 130 years ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This national history finds its way into the lore of the hidden world as well. The rumor among the hidden people, claims Magnus, is that when the Vikings came, they tried to kill and enslave the Irish peasants who were already living in Iceland. To escape, these Irish settlers fled into a hidden world, and there they have remained. &lt;/blockquote&gt;First posted 3/12/09&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-4062797217947443218?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday, people in New York &lt;a href="http://wcbstv.com/local/boom.nanuet.loud.2.954835.html"&gt;reported hearing a loud boom&lt;/a&gt;, like a sonic boom. Houses shook, and a woman reported seeing a yellow streak across the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news is reporting it as a potential meteor (they actually say &amp;quot;meteorite&amp;quot;, but that’s what they’re called only after they reach the ground). That’s certainly possible; if it got low enough it could create a sonic boom. Still, it’s not completely certain. Meteors are pretty common; if you go outside in a dark site for an hour you’re likely to see several. So the woman’s report may be coincidence; anything big enough to make a sonic boom would have been a lot more dramatic than &amp;quot;…a yellow light streaking across the sky.&amp;quot; But they didn’t directly quote the woman so I don’t know just how bright this was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article does say Doppler radar shows something that looks like it could have been a meteor, though, so this is an interesting story. They also said another boom was heard in a nearby area Monday morning as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s not all! In southern California last Wednesday &lt;a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/localnews/ci_11846677"&gt;there were also reports of a loud boom&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently there were no earthquakes reported, and there were no military planes going supersonic. This time there are no reports of meteors that I have found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we under attack? I’ve been getting email from people asking if this activity is unusual, but I don’t think it is. I think that it’s happening all the time, but people are noticing it more due to the way we get information. The internet is almost instantaneous now, with email and social networks like Twitter able to spread news in literally seconds and minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, still and video cameras are a lot more common, so we see more footage of meteors as well, with bright fireballs like the one over Texas recently grabbing headlines. So it’s not necessarily that it’s happening more often, but that we’re seeing and hearing about it more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you hear a loud noise some night, or witness a bright fireball, don’t panic! Grab your camera instead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236868766962"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/another_option_for_obama_to_do.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/77384f0e71a51941</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Environment"/><title type="html">Another option for Obama to do good</title><published>2009-03-12T15:12:42Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T15:12:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/M_0mTdWZVlw/another_option_for_obama_to_do.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/another_option_for_obama_to_do.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of his deplorable legacy, one of the last things George W. Bush rushed through in his last days of power was a set of changes in environmental policy that basically gutted protections for endangered organisms. &lt;a href="http://ecobarons.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/midnight-mischief-undone-polar-bear-protections-restored/"&gt;Our new president has been given the power to undo those changes in a recent spending bill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama may now, with the stroke of a pen, rescind the Bush Administration's last-minute rules that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;forcibly removed global warming from the list of extinction threats to the polar bear (despite scientific opinion that global warming is the bear's chief extinction threat)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;allowed oil and gas drilling in polar bear habitats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;eliminated the need to consult with wildlife and marine scientists when allowing mining, building, logging and other destructive projects that might increase extinction threats to endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it so, President Obama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/another_option_for_obama_to_do.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/M_0mTdWZVlw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236868766961"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/that_was_predictable.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5b9cb8630af000a4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">That was predictable</title><published>2009-03-12T14:35:06Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T14:35:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/aDw1PyyQVOA/that_was_predictable.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/that_was_predictable.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The case of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/a_follow-up_to_the_brazilian_c.php"&gt;Brazilian child who was raped, impregnated, and then had an abortion&lt;/a&gt; has taken a predictable turn. Sensible, rational people saw this as a tragedy, but one with a simple partial solution: the abortion was necessary to save the life of a young girl who could not possibly bear the burden of an unwanted pregnancy. The Brazilian Catholic church saw it differently and excommunicated everyone associated with the decision. Then the president of Brazil took a public stand against the church&amp;#39;s unjust decision. Now at last, we hear from the top of the Catholic hierarchy…and &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7930380.stm"&gt;the Vatican sides with fetuses over children&lt;/a&gt;. No surprise there at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, a church that preaches about a god of love has turned into a tableaux of empty gilt robes, devoid of human compassion, dedicated only to the perpetuation of a dead dogma. The utilitarian argument that religion at least provides comfort to people in need ought to be extinct now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/that_was_predictable.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/aDw1PyyQVOA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236868571642"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4827">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b0c9a0ff5105003</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="cars"/><category term="gasoline"/><category term="supply and demand"/><title type="html">How Laziness Makes Me Keep My Used Car</title><published>2009-03-12T14:08:44Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T14:08:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/rE1LDARCp9o/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/how-laziness-makes-me-keep-my-used-car/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Prices of used cars are rising, and the reason is substitution: in tough times, people substitute away from new cars and toward used cars.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even a few years ago the word "blog" inspired that peculiar mix of derision and dismissal that seems to haunt new media innovations long after they're proven. A blogger was a lonely, pajama-clad person in a dark room, typing out banal musings he mistook for interesting ones, to be read by a handful of friends or strangers if they were read at all.

&lt;p&gt;That blogs have now become a fixture of media and culture might, you'd think, give critics pause before indulging in another round of new media ridicule. But it ain't so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter, the micro-messaging service where users broadcast short thoughts to one another, has been widely labeled the newest form of digital narcissism. And if it's not self-obsession tweeters are accused of, it's self-promotion, solipsism or flat out frivolousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But naysayers will soon eat their tweets. There's already a vibrant community of Twitter users who are using the system to share and filter the hyper-glut of online information with ingenious efficiency. Forget what you had for breakfast or how much you hate Mondays. That's just lifecasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindcasting is where it's at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distinction is courtesy of Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu), a journalism professor and new media analyst at New York University. For him, Twitter is a new way to conduct a real-time, multi-way dialogue with thousands of his colleagues and fellow netizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Mindcasting came about when I was trying to achieve a very high signal-to noise-ratio," he explained. This meant using his Twitter account to send out tweets pointing to the best media news and analysis he could find, 15 or 20 times a day. "I could work on the concept of a Twitter feed as an editorial product of my own."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Rosen noted, that product is itself a distillation of the huge stream of input he gets from the nearly 550 journalists, analysts and news outlets he follows on Twitter. "I've hand-built my own tipster network," he said. "It's editing the Web for me in real time."....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the rest....then start following &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu" title=""&gt;Jay&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and stop laughing at the phenomenon:&lt;/p&gt;

The government, on the other hand, says it has increased research funding by billions of dollars and the complaining scientists are cry babies. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;They are both right. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;So, even though the editorial then goes on to (correctly) explain the scientists' position that injecting money for infrastructure (mostly at the request of universities, which is not the same as what scientists may have asked for) while simultaneously cutting basic grants, providing no new support for major agencies such as Genome Canada, and directing money increasingly toward government-preferred applied projects will likely harm Canada's research abilities, the editor thinks we're cry babies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;must &lt;/span&gt;be just a poor choice of wording, given the actual conclusion:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There are reports that Goodyear is quietly assuring people in the field that this cut will be restored in future budgets. If so, there seems no reason why that couldn't be done now. The amount in question is minuscule when compared to the $76.5 billion cumulative deficit projected over next three fiscal years (less than two-tenths of 1 per cent). And the danger of losing scientists and projects to the U.S. is real if the government waits until later. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-8633621418553480410?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/n3KhXfzDEPs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236864866682"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/time-to-hide-xkcd-from-the-man/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4e027df64a0a8e6c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">time to hide xkcd from the man…</title><published>2009-03-12T13:12:21Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T13:12:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/time-to-hide-xkcd-from-the-man/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;time to hide xkcd from the management http://xkcd.com/554/&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236864494862"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5889373952716320857">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4020a987d5ca64b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">On the Demise of Religion</title><published>2009-03-12T13:20:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T13:27:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-demise-of-religion.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/5889373952716320857/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=5889373952716320857" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Michael Spencer writes about The coming evangelical collapse in The Christian Science Monitor.We are on the verge – within 10 years – of a major collapse of evangelical Christianity.

Lessons From Abroad</title><published>2009-03-12T13:00:10Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T13:00:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=405" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;President Obama appears to be refreshingly pro-science in his outlook, publicly lauding objectivity and careful analysis. He has even been credited with saying that “we need evidence-based legislation” in regards to public policy. The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/us/politics/10obama.html"&gt;New York Times reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agencies will be expected to pick science advisers based on expertise, not political ideology, the memorandum said, and will offer whistle-blower protections to employees who expose the misuse or suppression of scientific information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea, the president said in remarks before an audience of lawmakers, scientists, patients advocates and patients in the East Room, is to ensure that “we make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideology”: a line that drew more applause than any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to healthcare reform, many policy decisions put us in uncharted territory, with intelligent arguments on both sides of many legislative options and no American historical frame of reference to help us determine the best course of action. In times like these, perhaps the best we can do (to promote “evidence-based legislation”) is to study similar policy decisions made by our Canadian and European counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a quest to inform myself about healthcare reform and its consequences in other countries, I attended a conference entitled, “&lt;a href="http://www.galen.org/component,8/action,show_content/id,14/category_id,0/blog_id,1172/type,33/"&gt;Lessons From Abroad for Health Reform in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;” at the Kaiser Family Foundation on March 9th in Washington DC. The event was sponsored by the &lt;a href="http://www.galen.org/component,8/action,show_content/id,18/"&gt;Galen Institute&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.policynetwork.net/main/content.php?content_id=1"&gt;International Policy Network&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom are politically rightward-leaning non-profit organizations. So I listened with interest, understanding that there may be other perspectives not fully represented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure what to expect from the conference, and assumed that speakers would offer a blend of pluses and minuses culled from Canadian and European healthcare reform experiences.

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alphonse Crespo, an orthopedic surgeon who practices in Lausanne, Switzerland, described what sounded like the utter decimation of a perfectly good healthcare system. He said that in the 1960s Swiss healthcare was decentralized and quality-oriented. The government provided subsidies for health insurance for the poor, and subsidized public hospitals who took care of the poor and/or uninsured at a 50% rate. Overall, according to Dr. Crespo, Swiss healthcare was efficient, effective, and had high patient satisfaction ratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, socialism came into vogue and reformers called for a redistributive model of healthcare, with centralization of infrastructure and electronic medical records systems that would be compatible with those in use by other European countries. Mandatory insurance was introduced, which shifted disproportionate power to third party payors. The payors focused primarily on cost containment measures and profitability, rather than expanding access to quality care. Regional hospitals were forced to merge with larger ones or else shut down. Wait times increased, lengths of stay decreased, and there was an increase in “critical incidents” (i.e. medical errors) &lt;a href="http://www.galen.org/component,8/action,show_content/id,14/category_id,0/blog_id,1172/type,33/"&gt;by 40%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002 the health insurers decided that “more doctors result in higher costs” and successfully lobbied for a cap on the total number of physician licenses, so that in order to practice medicine, a physician would need to take over the practice of a retiring physician or one who died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the third party payers attempted to legislate their ability to decide which physicians could practice within the healthcare system, and which would be excluded from coverage. This did not sit well with patients, and they voted for “freedom of choice” in a referendum on the issue. Fortunately, they blocked the insurer move to ban certain physicians from insurance coverage. Unfortunately, the insurers succeeded in forcing a reduction in reimbursement for basic laboratory testing by 20%, thus forcing physicians to close their labs and send samples to a centralized location.  Apparently physicians are planning to strike in Lausanne and Bern next week over this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Crespo argued that the unforeseen consequence of the move to compulsory insurance was the emergence of a powerful cartel of health insurers without any apparent cost savings, and a measurable decrease in care quality. In fact, Switzerland’s healthcare system rapidly plummeted from 4th place in the &lt;em&gt;Euro Health Consumer Index&lt;/em&gt;, to 8th place over the course of a few short years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once cartels have entrenched themselves, there is no easy way to dislodge them. Americans should think twice before opting for compulsory insurance, unless they believe that cartelized and rationed healthcare is really in the best interest of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada: A Political Healthcare Monopoly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aims.ca/aboutaims.asp?cmPageID=125"&gt;Dr. Brian Crowley&lt;/a&gt; is the Founder and President of the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He describes the Canadian healthcare system this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian Medicare operates in an unregulated, tax-financed, pay-as-you-go model. Our provincial governments are our monopoly provider. They not only pay for necessary care, but they also govern, administer, and evaluate the services that they themselves provide. They define what we call “medically necessary services” and pay for 99% of all physician services. They also forbid the use of private insurance for medically necessary services. They set the budgets for nominally private healthcare institutions. They appoint the majority of their board members and have explicit power to override management decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under these circumstances, no hospital or hospital administrator can be expected to take any responsibility or initiative because decisions will always be second-guessed by those in political power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the advent of competition in our telephone industry, dissatisfied customers faced the massive indifference of a bureaucracy that took their business for granted, despite some theoretically powerful regulatory agencies. Administrators of the Canadian healthcare system likewise suffer no direct consequences for poor customer service. They aren’t even answerable to a regulatory agency. Accountability is a vague political concept which cannot be enforced in any meaningful way. Like all monopolists, Canada’s healthcare authorities abuse their positions of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Crowley argued that the provincial governments have no desire to measure how many people are waiting for health services, how long they’ve been waiting, or how many people leave Canada to get treatment south of the border. (He claims that the US is Canada’s secret safety valve.) Apparently the province of Ontario contracted with New York State for cancer care for their patients when wait times became politically untenable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the healthcare system violates Canada’s charter of rights because it collects taxes, promises healthcare in return, forbids competing suppliers and then often doesn’t deliver the care. The justices summarized the situation this way: “A place in a queue is not healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada-wide average wait times for surgery is 17.8 weeks, though in Saskatchewan, wait times for hip replacements are as long as a year and a half. That’s after a physician has ordered the surgery. Getting to see a physician in the first place is very difficult. Statistics Canada reports that 1/5 of Canadians do not have a family doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Crowley suggested that the Canadian healthcare system has become an unresponsive monopoly though it wasn’t supposed to be that way. It was designed to usher in a “grand era of choice.” It was supposed to be a healthcare system in which people would be able to get all the healthcare they needed without having to “worry about the cost.” Dr. Crowley concluded that “some of the ideas bandied about in Washington will lead to the worst features of the Canadian system without that having been anybody’s intention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no healthcare utopia. As demand for services climb (with older and sicker patient populations) and expensive new drugs and technologies are developed, all industrialized nations are experiencing cost containment challenges. The need to ration care encourages shifts in power that can result in unintended consequences – including payer cartels and indifferent bureaucracies. As the United States congress prepares to legislate major health reform this summer, they will do well to gather all the evidence they can from countries who’ve previously enacted similar legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, it is likely that limited resources, a weak economy, and an aging population will pretty much guarantee dissatisfaction with our healthcare system in the decades to come. Will “evidence-based legislation” help us to avoid others’ mistakes? I hope so, but I’m also not holding my breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a little archaeological riddle I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about. From about 1350 to 1700, three-legged brass cooking pots were common in Sweden. When metal detecting in ploughsoil, you often find bits of them. They&amp;#39;re easily found as the fragments tend to be large and heavy: they make the detector sing loud &amp;amp; clear. But here&amp;#39;s the thing: you almost only find the &lt;i&gt;feet and legs&lt;/i&gt; of the pots, hardly ever the wall or rim. Why is that? I think I've come up with an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pots weren't used out in the fields. The reason that we find the feet there must be that household refuse was thrown on the manure pile and then carted out into the infields as fertiliser. The most likely place for a brass tripod pot to lose a leg was on the hearth in the kitchen. But this was not likely to go unnoticed: the pot would get overturned and spill its contents when it lost one of its three legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have a broken brass pot that's missing a leg, and you know where the leg is: among the embers on the hearth. What do you do? You put the broken pot away to sell it as scrap. But you can't get the leg immediately: it's glowing hot and possibly buried among the embers. So you decide to get it the next time you clean the ashes out of the hearth. And here's where I think the legs get lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hearths aren't cleaned daily. When they do get cleaned, the person doing that chore needn't be the same person who was using the pot when it broke, and if it is the same person, then it's not certain that they still remember the broken leg. Also, in order to clean out the hearth without burning down the house, you need to put the fire out completely, which means that you're working in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So every once in a while, legs and feet of these pots get thrown with the ashes onto the manure pile, and then carted out into the fields, where they spend 500 years before a metal detectorist finds them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update 15 March:&lt;/b&gt; Dear Reader Lassi Hippeläinen pointed something out that I hadn't thought of. "IMHO that pot was hanging from chains when it was over fire. It was standing on its legs only when it was brought to table." And I agree. I'm not sure what this means for the likelyhood of legs breaking off on the hearth.&lt;/p&gt;

They also set up many free MMR (they advertise only the mumps portion of the vaccine) clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has made the local anti-vaxxers none too happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://arcanum.ca/2009/03/04/mumps-is-back/"&gt;In a recent blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Allyson McQuinn, a local homeopath at the “&lt;a href="http://arcanum.ca/"&gt;Arcanum Wholistic Clinic&lt;/a&gt;”, decided to bash to Ontario government’s decision to promote the catch-up MMR shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the insanity being circulated at our local health department here in Ottawa. This is botched science at its best. The thinking being that if one dose doesn’t work, just give more! Sort of like spanking a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, non-sequitur. Second, Mrs. McQuinn is completely misrepresenting the government’s recommendation of the two-dose schedule. The two-dose schedule for the MMR vaccine has been suggested in the past and has been used in other countries. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8578851"&gt;Finland has been using it since 1982&lt;/a&gt;.  And not for the reason Mrs. McQuinn seems to think. The two-dose schedule has been proven effective in &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8578851"&gt;long-term follow-up studies &lt;/a&gt;.  It has been proven effective through &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950329"&gt;studying the outcome of outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;.  And through &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9009400"&gt;examination of antibody levels&lt;/a&gt; in single and double vaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs McQuinn continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if Mumps is what is needing to be addressed, why are they also proposing to re-immunize against Measles and Rubella (German Measles)? The latter has not reared it’s ugly little head for over 50 years and has been in fact declared “eradicated”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE MMR vaccine bundles these three immunities to make it more convenient and cost-effective to the patient. They are bundled because they are given at the same time in the vaccine schedule. Surely anti-vaxxers would at least approve of this three-in-one vaccine rather than subjecting the poor children to three times the preservatives and toxins if it were given in three separate shots. *roll eyes*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She states that Rubella has not “reared [its] ugly little head for over 50 years”. Except just a little over 3 and a half years ago there was &lt;a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1115644329079_12"&gt;an outbreak of Rubella in her own home province of Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.  Oops. And the elimination of endemic transmission of MM&amp;amp;R from the Americas has been all but achieved, however that does not mean throughout the world, and infection from foreign sources is still possible. There’s no “MMR Eradicator 2000″ posted at the borders, that’s what the two doses of the vaccine are for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McQuinn goes on to sell her particular brand of quackery to the reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you all know we use safe, proven homeopathic remedies to cure the underlying cause and also apply the same principled, lawful science to prevent Mumps on the basis of Homoprophylaxis. We can do this safely and effectively with any childhood illness you would like to prevent in your child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Homoprophylaxis” (sic) huh? Lawful science? Show me this science you speak of. I want placebo controlled, double blinded studies published in peer reviewed journals. And I don’t mean one of the many “Journals of Quackery”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow I sense that any response to that would be a bunch of anecdotes and testimonials. *sigh*&lt;/p&gt;

The general assumption is that most scientists are honest and, although we all generally try to present our data in the most favorable light possible, we do not blatantly lie about it or make it up. Of course, we are also all human, and none of us is immune to the temptation to leave out that inconvenient bit of data that doesn't fit with our hypothesis or to cherry pick the absolutely best-looking blot for use in our grant applications or scientific manuscripts. However, scientists value their reputation among other scientists, and there's no quicker way to seriously damage one's reputation than to engage in dodgy behavior with data, and there's no quicker way to destroy it utterly than to "make shit up."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, opposing these forces are the need to "publish or perish" in order to remain funded, advance academically, and become tenured, a pressure that can be particularly intense among basic scientists, who will basically lose their jobs and very likely their academic careers if they cannot cover 50% or more of their salaries through grants. I always remember that I'm fortunate in that, even if I failed utterly to renew all my grants and burn through whatever bridge funds my university might give me, I'd be unlikely to be fired, as I could just go back to operating full time. Indeed, I'd even be likely to generate more income for my department by doing surgery than I could through research. Clinician-scientists are in general a drag on the finances of an academic department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the pressures, however, I'm still left scratching my head over this recently revealed massive scientific fraud, as reported in &lt;a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?ses=ogst&amp;amp;section_id=3&amp;amp;show=dept&amp;amp;article_id=12634"&gt;Anesthesiology News&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123672510903888207.html"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/health/research/11pain.html?_r=1"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. A bunch of you sent it in to me, and when that happens, I usually conclude that I'd best comment on it. &lt;a href="http://www.anesthesiologynews.com/index.asp?ses=ogst&amp;amp;section_id=3&amp;amp;show=dept&amp;amp;article_id=12634"&gt;First, the fraud&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_most_massive_scientific_fraud_ever.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/the_most_massive_scientific_fraud_ever.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/-3GS0qewB1Y" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236854076317"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1225">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/06bae6e7e4df3f53</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><category term="Taboo vocabulary"/><title type="html">Franco-Croatian Squid in pepper sauce</title><published>2009-03-12T09:57:26Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T09:57:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1225" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CaoNiMa1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/CaoNiMa1.png" alt="" width="150" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's really hard to write a story about an obscene pun in a foreign language, when your publication won't let you say anything about the pun except to give the English translation of its innocuous side. That's the unenviable task attempted by Michael Wines in today's NYT ("&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html"&gt;A Dirty Pun Tweaks China’s Online Censors&lt;/a&gt;", 3/12/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Since its first unheralded appearance in January on a Chinese Web page,  the grass-mud horse has become nothing less than a phenomenon. A YouTube children’s song about the beast has drawn nearly 1.4 million viewers. A grass-mud horse cartoon has logged a quarter million more views. A nature documentary on its habits attracted 180,000 more. Stores are selling grass-mud horse dolls. Chinese intellectuals are writing treatises on the grass-mud horse’s social importance. The story of the grass-mud horse’s struggle against the evil river crab has spread far and wide across the Chinese online community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Not bad for a mythical creature whose name, in Chinese, sounds very much like an especially vile obscenity. Which is precisely the point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the story is about evading censorship adds additional semiotic layers to an article constrained by editorial policy not to explain the pun at its center. In Wines' own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The grass-mud horse is an example of something that, in China’s authoritarian system, passes as subversive behavior. Conceived as an impish protest against censorship, the foul-named little horse has not merely made government censors look ridiculous, although it has surely done that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, any reader with access to web search can find less fastidious explanations, for example one by Joel Martinsen at Danwei ("&lt;a href="http://www.danwei.org/humor/baidu_baike_fake_entries.php"&gt;Hoax dictionary entries about legendary obscene beasts&lt;/a&gt;", 2/11/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Meet the &lt;strong&gt;Grass Mud Horse&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;span title="cǎonímǎ"&gt;草泥马&lt;/span&gt;), a rare animal that has become phenomenally popular in the past month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The animal, whose name sounds like a common curse (&lt;span title="cāo nǐ mā - Fuck your mother"&gt;操你妈&lt;/span&gt;),  is the most famous of the Ten Legendary Beasts of Baidu, non-existent  animals that were inserted into Baidu's user-editable encyclopedia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel also explains both sides of the pun, in pinyin and in English translation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;草泥马 = CAO3NI2MA3 = "grass mud horse"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span title="cāo nǐ mā - Fuck your mother"&gt;操你妈&lt;/span&gt; = CAO1NI2MA1 = "fuck your mother"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he lists the other "ten legendary beasts" as well. My personal favorite is "The Franco-Croatian Squid (法克鱿, scientific name 'Vai-te Foder'): A fierce species of squid originally inhabiting Europe and the Americas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one is a cross-lingual pun, 法克鱿 = FA3KE4YOU2. I&amp;#39;m not sure whether the odd-seeming French-to-pinyin transliteration in the &amp;quot;scientific name&amp;quot; is standard Chinese practice, or a mistake due to imperfect knowledge of French on the part of the original contributor to Baidu. [Update: maire-lucie observes in the comments that it&amp;#39;s Portuguese, not French. The &amp;quot;Franco-&amp;quot; part confused me…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The (by now numerous) YouTube results include the original (translation &lt;a href="http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2009/02/music-video-the-song-of-the-grass-dirt-horse/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://humantrafficking.change.org/blog/view/turkey_company_pays_disabled_workers_044_an_hour"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://humantrafficking.change.org/"&gt;Human Trafficking&lt;/a&gt; alerted me to this article from the March 9 &lt;a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090309/NEWS05/90309034/-1/SPORTS12/Atalissa+case+a++wake-up+call+++Harkin+says"&gt;Des Moines Register&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.rootswire.org/category/organization/henrys-turkey-service"&gt;Henry’s Turkey Service&lt;/a&gt;, a company in Texas, is under investigation by state and federal investigation for "alleged exploitation of dozens of mentally retarded employees who for the past 34 years worked at a meat-processing plant near Atalissa, Iowa":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Henry’s disabled workers were paid about 44 cents an hour. Henry’s also provided the men with room, board and care in a 106-year-old bunkhouse that was closed last month by order of the state fire marshal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee was led by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Ia., who characterized the Atalissa case as a “wake-up call” with regard to workplace exploitation of the disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t imagine how – I don’t think embarrassing is the right word – but just how badly I feel that this has taken place in my own state,” Harkin said. “Under my own nose. I didn’t even know about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin asked John McKeon, deputy administrator of the Department of Labor’s wage-and-hour division, how the Atalissa operation went undiscovered for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How could it be that for going on 30 years they had this situation like this bunkhouse here – this abandoned school where these people lived – and no one from DOL would ever check?” Harkin asked. “How could that just go on year after year after year? Wouldn’t something pop up someplace? Wouldn’t there be an inspection?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not exactly surprisingly, officials of Henry's have "denied any wrongdoing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, violators of wage laws concerning disabled workers are "rarely asked to pay anything other than the wages owed to employees. They aren’t asked to pay interest, fines or damages," according to James Leonard, a former attorney for the U.S. Department of Labor. Indeed, Leonard notes that "'there's almost a financial incentive to take a chance that you won’t be caught'"---employers are rarely checked due to a lack of inspectors from the Department of Labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a long meeting with Charlie's teacher earlier this week and we talked, as we always do, about what he's going to have to learn to do and what he's going to have to learn &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do to get a job in the community. Looks like we're going to have to watch those who employ Charlie as closely as we do him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation of Henry's Turkey Services reveals that we're all going to have to put in extra work and craft policy and call for sufficient protections, supervision and accountability, to ensure that employees with disabilities are not taken advantage of and abused in the workplace. Doing so is all part of creating a world that &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/disabilities/"&gt;empowers individuals with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;. Such empowerment was the centerpiece of President Obama's policy for individuals with disabilities and ensuring the rights of workers with disabilities is a crucial, fundamental first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the number 1 donating team on Kiva is “&lt;a href="http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=94"&gt;Atheists, Agnostics, Skeptics, Freethinkers, Secular Humanists and the Non-Religious&lt;/a&gt;.” Yes, that’s right. The team has over &lt;strong&gt;3,000&lt;/strong&gt; members. It made over &lt;strong&gt;10,000&lt;/strong&gt; loans. Wait for it, wait for it… The team loaned more than &lt;strong&gt;$300,000&lt;/strong&gt;. It is incredible that atheists were able to come together and work for a common cause to help developing countries prosper. A simple step to a better future for the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that number 2 team is Kiva Christians with over $200, 000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grothe, vice president and director of outreach programs for the Center for Inquiry, in a restaurant inside Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. At a nearby table, a group of fifteen or so men spoke in hushed tones. Sometimes they were entirely inaudible to me, and the only way I knew they spoke at all was by the movement of their lips. It was reminiscent of watching a group of government operatives taking lunch. But, to my knowledge, none of the men in the restaurant were government operatives. They were mentalists - mentalists attending Luke Jermay's Mentalism Workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's not exactly a secret society," Grothe said, "but it is a society committed to keeping secrets."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never really thought of the secretive aspect of magic before. I mean, sure, mentalists aren't supposed to tell you how it's done, but I never envisioned a whisper-filled meeting that included celebrities like Teller, Max Maven, Eric Mead, and Jamy Ian Swiss. And, for something extra cool, Larry Fong, Director of Photography for 300 and Watchmen gave an excellent talk on story-telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never saw any of the actual workshop - I assume because I'm not that cool - but Grothe was willing to fill me in on a few of the details: The event is, sadly for me, invitation only, and has a very small number of attendees. The one I visited was the fifth of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236834349680"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/check_out_the_brand_new_homepa.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2aeb1a36ff88d536</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogging"/><title type="html">Check out the brand new homepage of Seed Magazine!</title><published>2009-03-12T05:06:42Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T05:06:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/hDZTTFNKd1U/check_out_the_brand_new_homepa.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/check_out_the_brand_new_homepa.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="http://seedmagazine.com/" title=""&gt;SEEDMAGAZINE.COM&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;What they say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our online magazine team has been hard at work creating a new look for SEEDMAGAZINE.COM, the magazine's homepage. As you'll see, it has a ton of new features and pretty new colors.

&lt;p&gt;The content of the site is now divided into four departments with subcategories in each, which makes for a total of 11 areas of coverage. The departments are: World (politics, development and environment), Ideas (findings and theory), Innovation (technology, design and business) and Culture (books, art and events). You can go straight to one department, or view the latest stories from every department on the homepage, color-coded according to which they fall under. There's also a new tagging system- each article is tagged with relevant keywords, and a tag menu on the left hand side of the page also allows you to search for all articles tagged with a specific keyword ("globalization," for example, or "proof," or "democracy").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click on the yellow "Studio" button in the upper right corner of the site, you'll see all slideshows, videos of Salon dialogues, Revolutionary Minds, an interactive rendition of the Universe of 2009 and more to stimulate the senses. The Zeitgeist, highlighting four of the top stories in science every day, and featured blog posts are still there, too (but of course).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004826" title=""&gt;Buying Years to Extinction: Is Compensatory Mitigation for Marine Bycatch a Sufficient Conservation Measure for Long-Lived Seabirds?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Along the lines of the 'polluter pays principle', it has recently been proposed that the local long-line fishing industry should fund eradication of terrestrial predators at seabird breeding colonies, as a compensatory measure for the bycatch caused by the fishing activity. The measure is economically sound, but a quantitative and reliable test of its biological efficacy has never been conducted. Here, we investigated the demographic consequences of predator eradication for Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea, breeding in the Mediterranean, using a population model that integrates demographic rates estimated from individual life-history information with experimental measures of predation and habitat structure. We found that similar values of population growth rate can be obtained by different combinations of habitat characteristics, predator abundance and adult mortality, which explains the persistence of shearwater colonies in islands with introduced predators. Even so, given the empirically obtained values of survival, all combinations of predator abundance and habitat characteristics projected a decline in shearwater numbers. Perturbation analyses indicated that the value and the sensitivity of shearwater population growth rates were affected by all covariates considered and their interactions. A decrease in rat abundance delivered only a small increase in the population growth rate, whereas a change in adult survival (a parameter independent of rat abundance) had the strongest impact on population dynamics. When adult survival is low, rat eradication would allow us to "buy" years before extinction but does not reverse the process. Rat eradication can therefore be seen as an emergency measure if threats on adult survival are eliminated in the medium-term period. For species with low fecundity and long life expectancy, our results suggest that rat control campaigns are not a sufficient, self-standing measure to compensate the biological toll of long-line fisheries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Human lumbar vertebrae support the weight of the upper body. Loads lifted and carried by the upper extremities cause significant loading stress to the vertebral bodies. It is well established that trauma-induced vertebral fractures are common especially among elderly people. The aim of this study was to investigate the morphological factors that could have affected the prevalence of trauma-related vertebral fractures from medieval times to the present day. To determine if morphological differences existed in the size and shape of the vertebral body between medieval times and the present day, the vertebral body size and shape was measured from the 4th lumbar vertebra using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and standard osteometric calipers. The modern samples consisted of modern Finns and the medieval samples were from archaeological collections in Sweden and Britain. The results show that the shape and size of the 4th lumbar vertebra has changed significantly from medieval times in a way that markedly affects the biomechanical characteristics of the lumbar vertebral column. These changes may have influenced the incidence of trauma- induced spinal fractures in modern populations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Parasites are likely to play an important role in structuring host populations. Many adaptively manipulate host behaviour, so that the extended phenotypes of these parasites and their distributions in space and time are potentially important ecological variables. The fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which is pan-tropical in distribution, causes infected worker ants to leave their nest and die under leaves in the understory of tropical rainforests. Working in a forest dynamic plot in Southern Thailand we mapped the occurrence of these dead ants by examining every leaf in 1,360 m2 of primary rainforest. We established that high density aggregations exist (up to 26 dead ants/m2), which we coined graveyards. We further established that graveyards are patchily distributed in a landscape with no or very few O. unilateralis-killed ants. At some, but not all, spatial scales of analysis the density of dead ants correlated with temperature, humidity and vegetation cover. Remarkably, having found 2243 dead ants inside graveyards we only found 2 live ants of the principal host, ant Camponotus leonardi, suggesting that foraging host ants actively avoid graveyards. We discovered that the principal host ant builds nests in high canopy and its trails only occasionally descend to the forest floor where infection occurs. We advance the hypothesis that rare descents may be a function of limited canopy access to tree crowns and that resource profitability of such trees is potentially traded off against the risk of losing workers due to infection when forest floor trails are the only access routes. Our work underscores the need for an integrative approach that recognises multiple facets of parasitism, such as their extended phenotypes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_133.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/u3z5Qhm7Fe8" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236834349679"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/big_beagle_project_news.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d4679593e22b8ea2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="History of Science"/><title type="html">Big Beagle Project news</title><published>2009-03-12T04:17:23Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T04:17:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/UaCL7dRDEEA/big_beagle_project_news.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/big_beagle_project_news.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It appears that the Beagle Project crew will have a &lt;a href="http://thebeagleproject.blogspot.com/2009/03/darwin-and-adventure-to-be-funded-by.html" title=""&gt;trial run&lt;/a&gt; on the Brazilian ship &lt;em&gt;Tocorime&lt;/em&gt; - not a replacement for building the Beagle, but getting the feet wet, seeing what is involved, learning from the experience, before the Real Deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funded by the British Council, they will circumnavigate around South America following that portion of the original Darwin's trip. From the proposal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The year 2009 marks the bicentenary of Charles Darwin's birth. Without a doubt the greatest influence on Darwin and the development of his theory of evolution came during his travels in and around South America, carried by HMS Beagle and supported by HMS Adventure. Darwin experienced the wonders of the tropical rainforest in Brazil, fossils in Argentina, the uplifting of land in Chile and the remarkable variation of fauna on the Galapagos Islands.

&lt;p&gt;This proposal aims to support the recreation of Darwin's travels around South America, undertaking new science as part of an international effort to understand and develop a system of DNA-based identification of taxa (DNA barcoding). It will correlate this science at sea on the Brazilian tall ship Tocorime (Portuguese for Adventure) with a view of the world that Darwin could only dream of - from the International Space Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding is sought to bring together scientists from South America and the UK, the Tocorimé operators, the organisers of The HMS Beagle Trust and NASA to plan a scientific expedition from Rio to the Galapagos that will throw new light on evolutionary science in a highly visible and exciting way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/big_beagle_project_news.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/UaCL7dRDEEA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236834349678"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/cholesterol_will_kill_you_earl.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/de6fa975fad9cb2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Cholesterol will kill you earlier than you think</title><published>2009-03-12T03:52:01Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T03:52:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/VRI8GVAcab4/cholesterol_will_kill_you_earl.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/cholesterol_will_kill_you_earl.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/dYqM9-Fj0Pg%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26rel%3D0%26color1%3D0xe1600f%26color2%3D0xfebd01%26border%3D1&amp;amp;width=445&amp;amp;height=364" width="445" height="364"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is there “evidence” that Obama really is a secret Muslim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;–Obama’s background, education, and outlook are Muslim, and fewer than 1% of Muslims convert to Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Obama’s middle name (Hussein) references Husayn, who was the grandson of Muhammad, which most Christians would not retain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Obama uses the Muslim Pakistani pronunciation for “Pakistan” rather than the common American one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Obama has chosen the Secret Service code name “Renegade”. “Renegade” conventionally describes someone who goes against normal conventions of behavior, but its first usage was to describe someone who has turned from their religion. It is a word derived from the Spanish renegado, meaning “Christian turned Muslim.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s their “evidence” for Obama being a secret atheist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;–When he initially took the oath of office on Tuesday, January 20, 2009, Obama misspoke (possibly due to Chief Justice Roberts not being prepared) and out of an “abundance of caution” the oath was retaken the next day. CNN.com noted, “Though a Bible was used in Tuesday’s oath, one was not used for Wednesday’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Since assuming office Obama has not attended a single church function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOOOOOO! Can’t he just be a secret child molester instead? Anything but an atheist of Muslim! LOL!&lt;/p&gt;

And even more shockingly, it’s a Republican. Here’s John Linder’s response to a letter from the anti-vaccine group &lt;a href="http://adventuresinautism.blogspot.com/2009/01/time-to-make-some-noise-over-iacc.html"&gt;Autism Action Network&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear X:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for contacting me to express your support for increased Federal funding for autism research. I appreciate hearing from you on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I understand that many parents of children struggling with autism blame vaccines for the onset of the disease, the science on this issue overwhelmingly suggests that vaccines do not cause autism. In fact, I am sure that you are aware of a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims which specifically rejected arguments that thimerosal in certain vaccines and the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine caused autism in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nobody is completely certain about the causes of autism, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has concluded that the most likely cause of autism is genetics. Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with autism, and studies of people with autism have found common irregularities in several regions of the brain. Other studies have shown abnormal levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in children with autism as opposed to children who show no signs of the disease. According to the NIH, the abnormalities suggest that autism could result from the disruption of normal brain development early in fetal development caused by defects in the how the brain regulates growth and neuron communication. In addition, a recent study in Israel has added momentum to the theory that genetics is responsible for autism. The study, which concluded in 2006, showed that the older a man was when fathering a child, the more likely it was that the child would have autism then a child with a young father. Even with this new research in mind, the NIH is still committed to continued autism research in order to better understand the disease. I support this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should know that I have twice successfully supported doubling Federal research funds for the NIH. I wholeheartedly believe that it is the responsibility of the Federal government to support scientific research to understand the causes of disease and to develop cures for those diseases. As such, I will continue to support NIH funding and research activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for contacting me. If I may be of any further assistance to you, please do not hesitate to call on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Linder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way to go, Linder!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quisp was my favorite cereal when I was a kid. It tastes like Cap’n Crunch, but doesn’t recreate the Battle of Hastings on the roof of your mouth. Years ago, when The Little Astronomer was very Little, we rediscovered Quisp at one of those box stores and I was able to convince her of its superiority to modern (that is, &amp;quot;stupid&amp;quot;) cereals. But when we moved from Maryland, that was that. California is a vast wasteland of cereals. Hope was renewed when we moved to Boulder, as I heard that some Albertsons stores in the Denver area carry it. But they won’t return my calls, and &lt;a href="http://www.quakeroats.com/products/more-products-from-quaker/content/cereals/quisp.aspx"&gt;the Quisp website&lt;/a&gt; is no help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So. The other day I was researching something, and stumbled on the El Dorado of cereals on Amazon.com. Oh frabjous day! With free shipping (Amazon Prime, baby!) it doesn’t cost any more than buying other cereals at the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ll pardon me now. I have something I must attend too. You can ignore the loud crunching sound.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236817741587"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/denialism_humor.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b7a39a3b1e05996</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Wasting your time"/><title type="html">Denialism Humor</title><published>2009-03-11T21:12:40Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T21:12:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/KFhsOtjRA2Q/denialism_humor.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/denialism_humor.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Brought to us by The Onion &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news/san_francisco_historians_condemn"&gt;San Francisco Historians Condemn 1906 Earthquake Deniers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 1906 Earthquake Deniers, a group reviled by Californians and scholars alike, held three days of lectures and roundtable discussions over what they call a "century-long hoax" of exaggerated seismic activity in the Bay area, and part of a conspiracy to bring the World's Fair to San Francisco in 1915. Historians protested the conference, saying the organization's statements denying any major seismic activity in 1906 are reprehensible and out of line with all available geologic data from the time.
...
"If an earthquake of that size really did strike downtown San Francisco, then where is all the rubble?" read one pamphlet, entitled "After$hock$: Truth, Lies, And The Business Of Earthquakes," obtained by reporters. "Where are these alleged 3,000 dead? And why does the mayor refuse to answer questions about the fires that mysteriously started moments after the supposed 'earthquake' occurred? Ask yourself: Who is he protecting?"

&lt;p&gt;The early 1906 Earthquake Denier movement began shortly after World War I, when historian Michael P. Harrison published an article alleging that the Chinese government and San Francisco Mayor Eugene Schmitz devised a plan to purposely light the city on fire to acquire funds for a new Chinatown. The modern day movement, however, gained momentum in 1971 with Professor David Compson's controversial book Earthquake?, which argued that the inability to freely question the disaster was "the equivalent of mental rape."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mental rape.  Awesome.  They even included the persecution complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for someone who might be moving to San Fran in a month, this hit a bit close to home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"San Franciscans need to wake up and smell the lies and deceits they've been fed for the last century," Earthquake Denier Jared Meeder said. "If a giant earthquake did actually occur, why would anyone in their right mind rebuild a city knowing full well that another earthquake could easily come along and destroy it again?"

&lt;p&gt;"Think about it," Meeder added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2001 law &lt;a href="http://www.bullypolice.org/or_law.html"&gt;H.B. 3403&lt;/a&gt; requires schools to create and enforce anti-bullying policies.  Since this seems not to have sufficient effect on bullying, a new anti-bullying law is being recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OPB article details three different bullying stories in Oregon public schools, from an Asperger's teen, a Native American (now) college student, and from a member of the Oregon Students Equal Rights Alliance, a GLBT group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-bullying laws are good, but I am unfortunately not surprised about their ineffectiveness.  In systems science, there is an idea of &lt;em&gt;leverage points&lt;/em&gt;, a point in a system where a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donella_Meadows%27_twelve_leverage_points_to_intervene_in_a_system"&gt;"small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything"&lt;/a&gt;.  Example: in the case of a serious sinus infection, the leverage--that thing that will actually change whether one has an infection or not--is in taking antibiotics, it is not in taking an antihistamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laws and policies not to bully are like antihistamines.  They may attack some of the symptoms of the problem but aren't working on a leverage point.  They do not target lack of understanding, tolerance, or empathy, or other key reasons why bullying may occur.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236812097102"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/todd_thomsen_would_like_to_hea.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5ebb2d394d840969</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Todd Thomsen would like to hear opposing views</title><published>2009-03-11T23:04:19Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T23:04:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/A6K-fElZ4m4/todd_thomsen_would_like_to_hea.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/todd_thomsen_would_like_to_hea.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thomsen is the Republican representative in Oklahoma who proposed several resolutions that would censure the OU zoology department and Richard Dawkins for not being nice to creationism. You really must see his &lt;a href="http://www.oudaily.com/news/2009/mar/11/state-representative-disapproves-darwin-2009-proje/"&gt;justification for condemning views he finds religiously disagreeable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am trying to promote free thinking. I strongly oppose the Department of Zoology for their unwillingness to lead our state in this discussion and not have opposing views in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not believe Todd Thomsen even knows what free thinking is. The zoology department is not leading the state in the discussion of creationism because the members of the zoology department, as is true for biologists everywhere, have examined the claims of creationists and discovered that even under the most superficial scrutiny, they are transparently nothing but collections of incoherent, fragmentary superstitions clumsily tied together with a glue of lies, spit, and bile. As &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/how_creationism_should_be_taug.php"&gt;I've said before&lt;/a&gt;, you could ask biologists to speak out more about creation "theory", but the results would not bring much joy to your local churches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do go read that article in the OU Daily, and in particular note the laudable comment from Michael J. Davis. Davis obligingly includes &lt;a href="mailto:todd.thomsen@okhouse.gov"&gt;Todd Thomsen's email&lt;/a&gt;, and I think that since Representative Thomsen places such importance on the communication of diverse views, everyone ought to take a moment and let him know exactly what his standing in the wider universe might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember, next election cycle, Mr Thomsen deserves to be unemployed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/todd_thomsen_would_like_to_hea.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/A6K-fElZ4m4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236811368419"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=658">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7e1892874487569f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="tech"/><title type="html">Restating</title><published>2009-03-11T18:25:31Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T18:25:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/2009/03/11/restating/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A lot of people mistook my last post to mean nothing on the internet will ever be free anymore. Despite the “High volume, ad-supported web businesses will always exist, because in certain areas (search for instance) they just make sense” disclaimer at the end, I think I did a poor job setting the tone. My assertion wasn’t that they are or will soon be dead, just that they’re going to be a lot less common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some startups where you want to charge users, and some that you want to be free and just go for growth, and which strategy you use depends on the nature of the startup, not the state of the economy.&lt;br&gt;
Thinking that every startup has to start charging its users now because the economy is bad is just as mistaken as thinking a few years ago that no startup had to charge its users because the economy was good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t disagree with that at all. I just think that for a long time most startups that should have been charging at least some of their users were afraid to. They’ve been erring on the side of free in very large numbers. They’ve been erring in that direction because it worked, and it worked because of a good economy, or at least it will cease to work for a time because of a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just as it maybe was too far to one extreme in a good economy, it will probably shift too far to the other in the bad one. It will be mistaken in many cases perhaps, but on the balance it will be closer to correct because most startups now don’t charge anyone for anything, when in reality most startups (but not all) probably should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, at least based on my own experience, founders choose their startup from a pool of ideas. I realize that probably not everyone is as creative as me, but I come up with at least one new product idea every day. I consign most of them to the scrapheap immediately because I just don’t think many people would use them. Some I think would be popular but well outside of our startup’s purview (hell, a couple were restaurants and one was a snow plowing business) and those I file away in case I need startup ideas years from now. Some I think would work and fit well with what we’re doing but my team doesn’t for whatever reason. And once in a blue moon one of those ideas makes it through all the filters and becomes a new Blue Frog Gaming product, like &lt;a href="http://apps.facebook.com/football_tycoon"&gt;Football Tycoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most startup founders are at least somewhat similar in that they have a lot of ideas from which they choose one. They don’t just see one thing somewhere that needs improving and go for it. They see lots of things everywhere that need improving and they choose the one that passes through their filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font style="overflow:hidden;height:0;width:0"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.videnov.com/"&gt;мебели стара загора&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;And for the last 5 or so years, startup founders haven’t really used “is this monetizeable?” as one of those filters. Why would they? Acquirers didn’t, so nobody on down the chain did. I think that’s going to change with the new economy, perhaps even more so than it really should.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236810946833"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1224">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/58549861a07d7bbe</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and technology"/><title type="html">English and Science in China and Japan</title><published>2009-03-11T22:26:41Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T22:26:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1224" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the opportunity for an eye-opening talk with a man who for 20 years has been the director of a world-renowned biochemistry and physiology research institute.  His job frequently takes him to key labs in China and Japan, and he always has scores of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean staff scientists and postdocs working in his own labs.  Here are some of the mind-boggling things the director told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1. In their labs, when Chinese and Japanese scientists are engaged in discussions on research topics, they often speak in English or heavily lace their Chinese and Japanese with English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Chinese and Japanese scientists regularly write to each other in English, often even on non-research topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. There is an extremely strong imperative in the scientific culture of China and Japan to publish in English language journals.  In China, there is even a fixed award schedule for researchers who get published in top English language journals, from very large monetary bonuses to individuals whose work makes it into the pages of Science and Nature, on down through lesser, but still substantial, rewards for work in less prestigious, specialized journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. English is the de facto language of scientific culture in China and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. The Chinese government and Chinese business interests offer scientists who have landed coveted positions in American universities and industry extremely lucrative packages to buy them back to the motherland.  So great are the financial inducements that American institutions simply cannot match them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Many labs in China are now state-of-the-art with world-class equipment purchased abroad; the best labs in China are even better equipped than the general run of labs in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Despite all of these manifest attractions, Chinese scientists often hesitate to return to the motherland because of the political, social, and economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Finally, and this is a very delicate subject, the FBI frequently contacts the director and sometimes comes to the director’s institute to discuss sensitive matters concerning espionage carried out by Chinese scientists working in his labs.  One woman scientist who had worked at the director’s institute was actually caught red-handed acquiring classified, high-technology equipment through her position in the institute and sending it back to China with the help of her husband (she apparently had been doing this for years before she was apprehended).  Astonishingly, this female Chinese scientist was neither imprisoned nor deported from the United States; she merely lost her job at the research institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of what the distinguished director told me I had heard or seen previously for myself, but I had never before received such a complete and coherent account from such an authoritative source.  Everything he says offers confirmation for what William C. Hannas wrote in his prescient books, The Writing on the Wall and Asia’s Orthographic Dilemma.  If anyone were systematically to gather information from scientists in positions of authority at scores of major research institutes in academia, industry, and business, as well as investigate what really goes on in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean research institutes in terms of organized acquisition of high-technology equipment, sensitive databases, proprietary designs and processes, patented engineering blueprints, and so forth, I am sure that their findings would provide even more devastating confirmation for Hannas’s pathbreaking volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only wish to add that there are signs that the surge toward English in East Asia is also encroaching upon the social sciences and even the humanities in certain sectors.  I will here only give one small example by way of evidence, but could cite many more instances from my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, a well-known Chinese historian, who has been my friend for about twenty years and who is the head of a research institute in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), wrote to me saying that the powers-that-be in CASS had issued an urgently-worded directive that research units under their administration should go all out to publish their individual work in English, that journals from CASS should have English versions, and, moreover, that adequate financial support would be provided to pay for skilled English translators from outside of China at going rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, I predicted that all of this (the rapid shift to English) would happen IF East Asian countries did not aggressively expand the applications of Romanization for their own languages.  To my mind at the time, this was simply a foregone conclusion due to the archaic nature of sinographic writing and the relatively inflexible phonetic representational ability of syllabic writing in comparison with alphabetic scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last footnote:  Several astute, impartial observers (both in East Asia and in the West) have mentioned to me that China is fast becoming (albeit still somewhat clandestinely) the world’s largest Christian nation, and we already know how important a role Christianity plays in Korea and among the Korean diaspora (the anomaly is Japan, where Christianity has made little headway since its severe persecution several centuries ago, shortly after it arrived there; this is probably due to the overwhelming role that Buddhism [and to a lesser extent Shinto] plays in all areas of public and private life).  It seems to me rather curious that the Englishization, as it were, of language usage in China is taking place in tandem with the Christianization of belief.  (Please note that I am a complete agnostic and that I have long since been thoroughly Sinicized in terms of my own language usage, so I have absolutely no stake in the Englishization or Christianization of China; I am only reporting what I have witnessed — as we might say in Chinese, this is a brief JIAN4WEN2 JI4 見聞記 [“a record of things seen and heard”].)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236810842072"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/11/not-all-canadians-are-reality-based/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b868a3869dc38605</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><title type="html">Not all Canadians are reality-based</title><published>2009-03-11T22:32:19Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T22:32:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/11/not-all-canadians-are-reality-based/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I like about Canada is that its citizens tend not only to be reality-based, but also are so matter-of-fact about it. Of course we don’t think vaccines cause autism, they might say? Why would you ever think that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some do succumb to nonsense. And some of these can be high profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I present to you one &lt;a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090223.wmacgregor23/BNStory/Front"&gt;Paul Hellyer, ex-Minister of Defence&lt;/a&gt; (sic). He thinks evidence for UFOs is &amp;quot;irrefutable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, yeah.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, he’s wrong.&lt;em&gt; Of course&lt;/em&gt; the UFO evidence is refutable. If it weren’t, then we’d know UFOs exist. Despite the claims of some, we still have not a single confirmed picture, video, sample, or sighting of a bona fide alien spacecraft. What we do have is a gazillion UFOs, but remember what the acronym stands for. It doesn’t mean &amp;quot;space ships&amp;quot;. It means stuff some people haven’t quite figured out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article linked above is chock full o’ nonsense. They say that more sightings means that this is more evidence of UFOs, which is silly. A thousand sightings is not evidence of space ships, any more than one is. Little candle-powered balloons released at weddings and other celebrations are on the rise — literally — all over the place, accounting for a lot of sightings, for example. I’m not saying that the reported UFOs by Canada aren’t something else, but I am pointing out that there are literally dozens if not hundreds of more mundane explanations of such things, and jumping to &amp;quot;spaceships&amp;quot; on the list may be just a &lt;em&gt;tad&lt;/em&gt; premature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure Hellyer will be the darling of the UFO set now, despite what is most likely a complete lack of any real new data. I predict he’ll rehash the same old stuff, but having a new voice will give the movement some new momentum. But as I’ve said here and elsewhere over and over again: &lt;strong&gt;show me the evidence&lt;/strong&gt;. I will not accept eyewitness testimony, which is prone to being fooled. Nor will I accept blurry photos, videos of Venus, or circumstantial evidence. If you claim UFOs are actually spaceships, the onus is on you to provide &lt;em&gt;solid&lt;/em&gt; evidence. Until then, don’t be surprised that so many people make fun of you. You can make all the claims you want that aliens carved Homer Simpson into your wheat crop, or that carnivorous or medically inept Reticulans have been munching on bovine posteriors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until you have the solid evidence, all you’re doing is repeating the same tired old stuff, and no matter how many times you say it, it won’t make you right.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236809350586"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/older_dads_the_truth_smarts">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/371960ad9a960484</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Older Dads: The Truth Smarts?</title><published>2009-03-11T21:28:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T21:28:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/older_dads_the_truth_smarts" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_u337ThvlyDw/RsPr-tMaYTI/AAAAAAAAAjE/iXQQ36T4v-w/s320/IQ%2Btest.jpg" height="140" alt="IQ test and man with ? over his head" style="float:right;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-left:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="200"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Has the secret for the "&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/15/AR2008021502901.html"&gt;dumb and dumbering of America&lt;/a&gt;" been found? A glance at numerous stories in the media in the past few days would suggest there's been a eureka moment: Blame it on those 50+ year old dads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in the most recent &lt;a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000040&amp;amp;ct=1"&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/a&gt; has found that children born to older fathers scored lower on I.Q. tests than children of younger fathers at 8 months old, 4 years old and 7 years old. Reports on this study were inevitably accompanied by reference to &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/its-the-old-dad-theory-once-again/"&gt;studies linking older dads to children on the autism spectrum &lt;/a&gt; (all to be read with a few caveats). From the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/health/10dads.html?scp=3&amp;amp;sq=autism&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there has been a bit of a cultural bias against even looking at this issue, but finally people are willing to entertain this,” said Dr. Dolores Malaspina, a professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="http://www.med.nyu.edu/"&gt;New York University Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; who has written studies on the risk of schizophrenia among children of older fathers as well as the lower nonverbal I.Q. scores found among teenagers with older fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the mother of an autistic son---still cringing to hear the name of &lt;a href="http://unstrange.com/bettelheim.html"&gt;Bruno Bettelheim&lt;/a&gt;---I always feel wary towards studies that link congenital disabilities in a child to something in particular about a child's parents.  What will follow: Societal injunctions that individuals above a certain age not procreate, so great is the fear of having a child who scores lower on I.Q. tests and other "cognitive measure"? From &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090309092941.htm"&gt;Science Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the trend towards older maternal and paternal ages in the developing world, policy-makers may want to consider promoting an awareness of the risks to children that this study associates with delayed fatherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as what I.Q. measures and what they don't: It's been found that, when &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/he-looks-so-smart/"&gt; different intelligence test was used than the standard test (which focuses on language and social interactions) to evaluate autistic children&lt;/a&gt;, many of the children were found to be significantly more intelligent than assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

Good movie, good acting, interesting theme. And there's an added perk for fans of &lt;i&gt;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&lt;/i&gt;. To the extent that the Kinsey movie has a villain, it's Alfred Kinsey's colleague, Thurman Rice. Professor Rice is an old-school sex-hostile sex educator who shows the class horrific slides of syphilis sufferers and preaches abstinence. And who plays this buffoonish prig of a character? Why, Frank N. Furter himself, the pansexual mad scientist from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy Transylvania -- Tim Curry.

The only difference is that billions are willing to accept the former, but no one is crazy enough to accept the latter…you&amp;#39;d think. Not so, though: there is actually something called the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_Elf_School"&gt;Icelandic Elf School&lt;/a&gt; where you can learn all about the classification and cultivation of various sorts of fairy-like entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also known as &lt;i&gt;Álfaskólinn&lt;/i&gt; in Icelandic, The &lt;b&gt;Icelandic Elf School&lt;/b&gt; teaches students and visitors about the five different kinds of elves or hidden people in myth that are believed to inhabit the country of Iceland. The school is located in Reykjavík, the country&amp;#39;s largest city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school is headed by Magnús Skarphéðinsson, brother of the leader of one of Iceland&amp;#39;s largest political parties. Magnús has a full curriculum, and certificate programs for visitors that can be earned in as little as half a day. However, the school also publishes texts on hidden people, partly for its own use in the classroom. There is also ongoing research on the elves and hidden people of Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking that this organization sounds a lot like the American Discovery Institute, or just about any bible college you can name.&lt;/p&gt;

No sensible person dismisses the humane treatment of animals as inconsequential, but what the fanatics propose is not an advance in social ethics. To the contrary, it is an irrational intrusion into civil society, a tantrum masquerading as a movement. It is a kind of ethical pornography in which assertion stands in for ideas, and willfulness for argument, all for the sake of self-gratification. At the end of the day, there is no moral equivalence between the lives of humans and those of animals.

The way I read the bill, scientists with federal funding would not be able to publish their data openly. However, some commenters disagreed, saying the bill did not do at all what I said it would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,  &lt;a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/"&gt;Lawrence Lessig&lt;/a&gt; — a professor of law at Stanford — was interviewed about this very bill, and his conclusions are very similar to what I originally wrote. Because of this, I will for now stand by my original conclusion: this bill would prevent or make it very difficult for scientists to distribute their work except through very expensive journals, and that this would slow scientific progress due to the lack of open source publication of research. If better evidence comes along, then I am willing to listen, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blip.tv/play/geUe8YoShYE6"&gt;Here is that interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, Representative Conyers &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-conyers/a-reply-to-larry-lessig_b_172642.html"&gt;has posted a rebuttal to Lessig on The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll add that I do think that Lessig’s attacks on Conyers about corruption are strident; I myself said that it’s interesting that Conyers received far more than average donations from the publishing industry, but note that the total amount isn’t much (about $9000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/2009/03/a_reply_to_congressman_conyers.html"&gt;Lessig has posted a rebuttal to this&lt;/a&gt;, and so on it goes. I will continue to read about this as I have time and it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236795049180"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/regulatin_genes_is_crucial_to.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88f46d5ae8295299</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><title type="html">Regulatin’ Genes is Crucial to Development</title><published>2009-03-11T18:15:54Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T18:15:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/FW06Ww4bUAs/regulatin_genes_is_crucial_to.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/regulatin_genes_is_crucial_to.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I hope &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k_oKK4Teco"&gt;these guys&lt;/a&gt; win a Grammy, because this rap is the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;NCSU molecular biologist Jorge Piedrahita has cloned pigs and explored why they are not carbon copies despite sharing the same DNA. Now he is trying to crack puzzles that could result in transgenic animals useful in human and veterinary medicine. His studies in cloned pigs led him to an unusual family of genes called imprinted genes, involved in placental function and fetal development. Recently he found they are implicated in human diseases too and is developing stem cell technologies in swine to try to speed up clinical applications in people.

&lt;p&gt;To learn more, come hear Piedrahita discuss "From cloning to stem cells: How can pigs help us solve problems in human medicine?" at the next Sigma Xi Pizza Lunch at noon on Wednesday, March 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pizza Lunch is free and open to science journalists and science communicators of all stripes. Feel free to forward this message to others you think might be interested. RSVPs are required (for a reliable slice count) to cclabby@amsci.org.&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn't matter if one is a pragmatic who is trying to do the best he can, is being honest and open, while the other was a lunatic who got us into this mess in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, they say that both of them &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/dc_press_core_dissed_again_-_b.php" title=""&gt;treat the press corps&lt;/a&gt; the same!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or that both use signing statements &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/why_people_dont_care_about_new.php" title=""&gt;the same&lt;/a&gt;!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or ignoring the people who &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/derivatives_echo_chamber.php?page=all" title=""&gt;predicted the economic calamity&lt;/a&gt;!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Froomkin &lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/white-house-watch/2009/03/obama_as_the_anti-bush.html" title=""&gt;analyzes this journalistic pathology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, believe it or not, the journos also want to equate the politization of science between the two parties! Can you imagine how tortuous those arguments must be! &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/3/10/8416/46232/216/706609" title=""&gt;Read this&lt;/a&gt;!?! Wut? Harold Varmus and Karl Rove are on equal footing and have equal expertise in SCIENCE!!!! And are thus given equal reverence by the idiotic journalist?!? Oh my!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, watch The Intersection as Chris Mooney is keeping an eye at this curious phenomenon, e.g., &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/03/the_democrat_war_on_science_me.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/03/obama_unleashes_stem_cell_rese.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2009/03/the_importance_of_obamas_scien.php" title=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think GOP still exists, despite the complete ridiciulousness of ALL of their ideas (racism, sexism, trickle-down-economics, "small government" crap, etc.) only because the press needs to always have that "other side" for every article, and to present both sides as equally worthy of not laughing at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_falsest_balance_in_journal.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/6LQwjTeqA-4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236793923699"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1220">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/82b697978196a3a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Orthography"/><category term="Phonetics and phonology"/><title type="html">Breck?nridge</title><published>2009-03-11T17:50:47Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T17:50:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1220" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife Karen and I just spent a long weekend with her family in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. As I've &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005238.html"&gt;mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, there are some noteworthy (though not necessarily unique) properties of the local Louisville accent. One of these is a property shared among many Southern dialects of American English in some form or another: the lack of a (clear) distinction between [ɪ] and [ɛ] before [n] (and sometimes other nasal consonants as well), such that e.g. &lt;i&gt;pin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pen&lt;/i&gt; are (nearly) homophonous. To my ear, the result of this merger for natives of Louisville sounds closer to the [ɪ] vowel that I myself produce in &lt;i&gt;pin&lt;/i&gt;, but I have not done any serious analysis to confirm or disconfirm this impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another merger that is common to pretty much all English speakers is the reduction of many vowel distinctions to [ə] (schwa) in unstressed syllables. Thus, &lt;i&gt;atom&lt;/i&gt; is [ˈæɾəm] while &lt;i&gt;atomic&lt;/i&gt; is [əˈtʰɑːmək], with the vowels changing depending on which vowel is stressed and which vowel is unstressed. Relatedly, &lt;i&gt;carafe&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;giraffe&lt;/i&gt; only differ in the initial consonant; the former is [kəˈɹæf] and the latter is [ʤəˈɹæf], both with [ə] in the initial unstressed syllable even though these vowels are spelled differently. (But note that unlike &lt;i&gt;atom/atomic&lt;/i&gt;, the unstressed vowels of &lt;i&gt;carafe&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;giraffe&lt;/i&gt; never really have an opportunity to be stressed; they are virtually always pronounced as [ə] and thus the difference in spelling is, practically speaking, entirely arbitrary.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between [ɪ] and [ə] is pretty subtle, and the result of unstressed vowel reduction for some English speakers in some contexts is reported to be [ɪ] rather than [ə]. For example, on p. 97 of &lt;i&gt;A Course in Phonetics&lt;/i&gt; (4th ed., 2001), &lt;a href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/"&gt;Peter Ladefoged&lt;/a&gt; wrote: "I have transcribed the first vowel in 'explain' as [ɪ] because that is the form I use. But other dialects may have [ə] or some other quality."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This potential confound between [ɪ] and [ə] presents a special problem for natives of Louisville. Suppose there's a word with an unstressed vowel followed by [n], like [ˈbɹɛk__nˌɹɪʤ]. How should this word be spelled? The unstressed vowel sounds (kinda like) [ɪ], so the options are &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;, given the lack of a distinction between these two vowels before &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; in Louisville. So, the word can be either &lt;i&gt;Breckinridge&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Breckenridge&lt;/i&gt;. And, in fact, we find exactly this variation: the road that we take to get to the airport when we leave Louisville is &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=Breckenridge+Ln,+Louisville,+Jefferson,+Kentucky&amp;amp;sll=38.227663,-85.635509&amp;amp;sspn=0.084146,0.174923&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=38.221594,-85.631905&amp;amp;spn=0.084153,0.174923&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=13&amp;amp;iwloc=addr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Breckenridge Lane&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, except when it's &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=Breckinridge+Ln,+Louisville,+Jefferson,+Kentucky&amp;amp;sll=38.239883,-85.740327&amp;amp;sspn=0,359.956269&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;geocode=FeVIRwIdiU7l-g&amp;amp;split=0&amp;amp;ll=38.227663,-85.635509&amp;amp;spn=0.084146,0.174923&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=13&amp;amp;iwloc=addr"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Breckinridge Lane&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I had an opportunity on this visit to take a couple of photographs highlighting this: the one on the left is a street sign near 900 Breck&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;nridge Lane and the one on the right is a sign for a business located at 950 Breck&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;nridge Lane, just a block away.&lt;/p&gt;

He claims that he's focusing on me because of the "&lt;a href="http://debunkingloftus.blogspot.com/2009/03/i-think-christianity-is-cult-by-john-w.html?showComment=1236687600000#c5086776451066935144"&gt;entertainment value&lt;/a&gt;." Hmmmmm. What's that exactly? And if so, is this a good "stewardship" of his time? In fact his answer is disingenuous, for inconsistently he later added I'm an "enemy of the common good." Lot's to say about that one. No one bothers with enemies who don't have any power, now do they? So you see, he cannot even honestly or consistently tell us why he's targeting me. Besides, most of what we'll get from him are &lt;em&gt;ad hominems&lt;/em&gt;. He's the one who has entertainment value I think! ;-) Dr. Keith Parsons calls him an "idiot loser" and &lt;a href="http://secularoutpost.infidels.org/2008/07/idiot-loser-crap-apologist-takes-on.html"&gt;proclaims&lt;/a&gt;: "If you elicit foaming rants from Holding and his ilk, you must be doing your job."&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't plan on giving Holding much attention here at all. Attention is what he craves. In fact, among his ignorant followers they think he's pretty important precisely because he gets some pretty important skeptics to turn our guns on him. His followers conclude he must be doing something right if we go after him. But the truth is that Holding merely annoys us by treating us with such disrespect that we feel compelled to respond. He makes us angry, not because he has great arguments but because of his demeanor toward us. As Dr. Parsons says of him in the link above: "Holding is like the big, fat cockroach that scuttles across your kitchen floor. You just can't resist the temptation to stomp on him." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one of his diatribes Holding called Dr. Hector Avalos "Dr. Stupid" not long ago. As you'd guess that got a rise out of him. So Avalos powerfully responded to Holding &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/01/dr-hector-avalos-responds-to-jp.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. [You must read this sound trashing!]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there is the case of former DC member, Matthew J. Green, who as a skeptic tried to be Holding's friend to no avail, and finally &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/06/writing-james-p-holding-off.html"&gt;wrote him off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want everyone to know &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/10/what-motivates-me.html"&gt;what motivates me like nothing else&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to doing what I'm doing. Hint: Holding has something to do with it, along with a few others. [You must read what I wrote if you haven't already].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most important debates about Holding and his ilk has to do with his Biblical justification for ridiculing and belittling apostates, skeptics and yes, even other Christians he thinks are heretics. Holding’s justifications for being obnoxious to people who don't accept the "truth" can to be found &lt;a href="http://www.tektonics.org/lp/madmad.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Most everyone would disagree with Holding on this. He and others like him live in a tiny tiny part of the world. I've weighed in on this matter &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-dealing-with-apostates-like-us.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. What do you think?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-4564376602766552017?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The Quote Garden provides an extensive list of &lt;a href="http://www.quotegarden.com/be-self.html"&gt;Quotes about Being Yourself&lt;/a&gt;.  Psychology Today published an online article &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-4576.html&amp;amp;fromMod=popular_personality"&gt;Dare To Be Yourself&lt;/a&gt;, which probes the idea of authenticity, of "being ones self," from a lot of directions, including the necessity of it for well being,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Authenticity is] also a cornerstone of mental health. Authenticity is correlated with many aspects of psychological well-being, including vitality, self-esteem, and coping skills. Acting in accordance with one's core self--a trait called self-determination--is ranked by some experts as one of three basic psychological needs, along with competence and a sense of relatedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Psychology Today article also discusses self-awareness and the need to understand both one's strengths and weaknesses and learn how to work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; not &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; them.  From outside the realm of anything-autism, the importance of being one's self is typically not argued against.  People want to act in accordance with their core values and sense of self, and feel uncomfortable when they go against such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is there so often a double standard when it comes to autism?  Why suddenly is it vital for an autistic person to be something other than themselves, something much more like everyone else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new essay by Jim Sinclair, &lt;a href="http://www.cjob.com/Blog/StationShared/Blog/OnTheEdge/blogentry.aspx?BlogEntryID=10024815"&gt;What Does Being Different Mean?&lt;/a&gt; eloquently, succinctly addresses these questions and many related, and echos the same message quoted above from Psychology Today,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some autistic children internalize this message and accept "being normal" as their major goal in life. And it's been my observation that the more deeply invested an autistic person is in being normal, the more likely it is that he or she suffers from anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. It's a natural consequence of making one's top priority to become something other than oneself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been ample demonstration that I can function more effectively by starting from a position of strength rather than one of weakness: that is, by presenting myself as myself rather than trying to become something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being one's self may be difficult whether one is autistic or not.  But it is also a critical key to health and success, whether one is autistic or not.  Self-improvement always needs to be self-determined and in the service of becoming more fully one's self, acting in accordance with one's core, regardless of one's neurology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting.  ~e.e. cummings, 1955&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236791585929"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6414">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/279820ff7e8fd86f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Drinking Skeptically in Minneapolis</title><published>2009-03-11T16:38:45Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T16:38:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6414" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7f8dc9b4af2d865e06ed52ad165c9589&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, fellow blizzard weary people!

In this case, young ignoramuses from Liberty University are filed through the Smithsonian Institution to practice closing their minds, while a newspaper reporter echoes their rationalizations. I hate these exercises in bad journalism: there is absolutely no critical thinking going on here, either among the creationists or the reporter writing it up. An example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I love it here,"&lt;/span&gt; said Ross, who has a doctorate in geosciences from the University of Rhode Island. &lt;span&gt;"There's something romantic about seeing the real thing."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Modern creationists don't deny the existence of dinosaurs but believe that God made them, and all animals, on the same sixth day that he created man. In fact, Ross's only real beef in the fossil hall is with the 30-foot lighted column that is a timeline marking 630 million years of geology. As a young-Earth creationist, he asserts that the vast majority of the rocks and fossils were formed during Noah's flood about 4,000 years ago. Most paleontologists date the T-Rex to 65 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible to be a Christian and still have a rational respect for the evidence. Take, for example, the Reverend Adam Sedgwick, an opponent of evolution in the 19th century, but also someone who worked out details of the geological column and determined that the idea that there was a single, defining world-wide flood was untenable. Or Charles Lyell, who struggled with the idea of evolution because it conflicted with his religious beliefs, but who was a major force in bringing about the understanding of geology as a product of continually acting forces. Or the Reverend William Buckland, who believed in a global flood, but regarded it as insufficient to account for the wealth of geological complexity — he would not have looked at the timeline and tried to compress it into the product of a single biblical event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were people working almost &lt;i&gt;200 years ago&lt;/i&gt;. The question of flood geology has long been settled — it&amp;#39;s wrong. And the evidence has only gotten stronger since for an old earth and a complex history. Marcus Ross is a man standing among a collection of some of the best and strongest and most thoroughly vetted and cross-checked evidence that directly contradicts what he claims, and he is spluttering out ignorant uncomprehending gibberish. He has a doctorate in the geosciences, we are always told, but he learned nothing. That ought to be the story here, about the peculiar psychology of these purblind creationists, but the journalist just let&amp;#39;s it slide by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How bad is the 'education' these poor students receive at Liberty University? This anecdote tells the tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the "Evolution Trail," the class showed no signs of being swayed by the polished, enthusiastic presentation of Darwin's theory. They were surprised, though, by the bronze statue of man's earliest mammalian ancestor.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"A rat?"&lt;/span&gt; exclaimed Amanda Runions, a 21-year-old biochemistry major, when she saw the model of a morganucodon, a rodent-like ancient mammal that curators have dubbed Grandma Morgie. &lt;span&gt;"All this hype for a rat? You're expecting, like, at least an ape."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Morganucodon&lt;/i&gt; is a genus of early mammals that lived over 200 million years ago. &lt;i&gt;200 million years ago&lt;/i&gt;. We're talking about the Upper Triassic, in the early part of the Mesozoic. She is expecting &lt;i&gt;apes&lt;/i&gt;? She thinks the only animals worth getting excited about must be primates? She is &lt;i&gt;surprised&lt;/i&gt; by the fact that paleontology reveals a succession of forms, with the only mammals in the early Mesozoic being small rat-like forms? Oh, dear, don't introduce her to the Paleozoic, she'll be shocked at the mere fish that represent our ancestors of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real story here, the one that the staff writer for the Washington Post ignored, is that Liberty University is victimizing young people like that woman and making them believe that they are biochemistry majors when they're actually being intellectually abused by an anti-scientific propaganda mill. There was a time when investigative journalism was actually practiced, and this would be an opportunity to expose a disgraceful pseudo-academic fraud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/creationists_in_denial.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/8HdJdNzluMY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236789259533"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/hiya_illinois.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/830e0096e63d5909</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Hiya, Illinois!</title><published>2009-03-11T15:27:20Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T15:27:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/oupdEcL05bw/hiya_illinois.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/hiya_illinois.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true — I&amp;#39;m going to be speaking at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana on Friday, 13 March, at 6:00 in &lt;a href="http://illinois.edu/ricker/CampusMap?buildingID=43&amp;amp;target=displayHighlight"&gt;Gregory Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Well, nominally at 6:00 — my flight schedule is cutting it awfully close, giving me only an hour of leeway, so we&amp;#39;ll see if I make it in time. If I don&amp;#39;t, start the conversation without me. This one is going to be a bit on the history of embryology, with some discussion of modern interpretations of the well-known facts of development…including the thoroughly bogus claims of creationists. I will be teaching the controversy — I&amp;#39;ll be showing the audience how idiotic the Discovery Institute&amp;#39;s claims are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no after-the-talk plans…yet. I&amp;#39;m sure that an informal get-together will coalesce afterwards, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For future reference, I'm also going to be in Michigan in two weeks, in Ashland, Oregon on 22-24 April, and LA in mid-May.

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I read about new “treatments” for autism that seem too wacky to be real. Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the time they are all &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; real. What I am talking about today is the use of nicotine patches to “treat” autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of this latest therapeutic misadventure in autism begins with a &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081117103651.htm"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on 17 November 2008 at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington, D.C. by Dr. Rene Anand, an associate professor of Pharmacology at Ohio State University’s College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anand’s presentation was about &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=600565"&gt;neurexin-1&lt;/a&gt;, a gene that has been implicated in &lt;a href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/17/11/1569"&gt;nicotine addiction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/18/5/988"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=18179900"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;. In his research (not yet published), Dr. Anand has apparently found that one of the products of the neurexin-1 gene (neurexin-1 beta) is responsible for directing a specific type of acetylcholine receptor (nicotinic receptors) to the synapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since abnormalities in acetylcholine receptors have been noted in autism (see &lt;a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/7/1483"&gt;here &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6T07-4BVNYBW-1&amp;amp;_user=1694017&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000054237&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=1694017&amp;amp;md5=e0d49354d6073bbd0e538fab6ec6281f"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and the neurexin-1 gene has &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; been implicated in autism, this seems like an promising line of inquiry into the etiology of autism. When asked, Dr. Anand was quoted as saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we were to use drugs that mimic the actions of nicotine at an early time in human brain development, would we begin to help those and other circuits develop properly and thus significantly mitigate the deficits in autism? This is a novel way of thinking about how we might be able to use drugs to approach autism treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good. It certainly sounds like an intriguing area for future research. But how did the “biomedical” community of practitioners respond to this information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/bradstreet.html"&gt;Dr. Jeff Bradstreet&lt;/a&gt;, noted &lt;a href="http://www.kevinleitch.co.uk/dan-doctors-us.html"&gt;DAN!&lt;/a&gt; physician, has jumped on this news and is currently treating autistic children with nicotine patches (see &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.icdrc.org/documents/Link%20between%20the%20Vagus%20Nerve,%20Cholinergic%20Deficit.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, esp. the last three slides). I’m sure he’s not the only one, but he’s been kind enough to put his……”practices” on the web for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/184/"&gt;Dr. Bradstreet&lt;/a&gt; is treating autistic children with the nicotine patch, there are sure to be several other “alternative” practitioners who are following his lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is truly frightening to watch how a bit of speculative musing was “morphed” in a few short months into a full-blown “biomedical” treatment for autism. Without even a &lt;em&gt;single piece of data&lt;/em&gt; supporting the use of nicotine in autism, “alternative” practitioners are slapping nicotine patches on autistic children across the country (and possibly all over the world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his usual fashion, Dr. Bradstreet has marshalled a number of tangentially relevant studies to support - after the fact - his decision to promote this “treatment”.  He cites the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;amp;_udi=B6T0N-4PRYFT0-1&amp;amp;_user=1694017&amp;amp;_rdoc=1&amp;amp;_fmt=&amp;amp;_orig=search&amp;amp;_sort=d&amp;amp;view=c&amp;amp;_acct=C000054237&amp;amp;_version=1&amp;amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;amp;_userid=1694017&amp;amp;md5=78440fd72153d4ba66ae7fbf62e8d3ee"&gt;Potter and Newhouse (2008)&lt;/a&gt; study that showed the nicotine patch improved cognitive performance &lt;em&gt;in young adults (18 - 22 years old) with ADHD &lt;/em&gt;[Note: ADHD is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same as autism].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also cites (but apprently does not comprehend) the &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=15582913"&gt;Sacco &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; (2004)&lt;/a&gt; review of  nicotinic receptor mechanisms and cognitive function (if he had &lt;em&gt;understood&lt;/em&gt; it, he would have seen that it didn’t support the use of nicotine in autism - it doesn’t even &lt;em&gt;mention&lt;/em&gt; autism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, he makes liberal use of the graphics in the &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=17502850"&gt;de Jonge and Ulloa (2007) &lt;/a&gt;article about the anti-inflammatory actions of the α-7 acetylcholine receptor without showing that autism is caused by neuroinflammation (although he seems fixated on that concept, the data supporting it is weak at best). His presentation also wanders into vagal nerve stimulation, which is a frightening window onto what he may be considering in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to emphasise that I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; picking on Dr. Bradstreet. He, at least, has made an &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; (largely negated by his use of scientific studies to “prove” what he already “believes”) to understand the science behind what he proposes to do to autistic children. Others haven’t even gone &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; far - they simply mimic what “everyone else is doing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But enough about Dr. Bradstreet and the parrot practitioners. What is the actual likelihood of the nicotine patch &lt;em&gt;helping&lt;/em&gt; an autistic child? Let’s go back to Dr. Anand’s statement for a moment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we were to use drugs that mimic the actions of nicotine &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;at an early time in human brain development&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, would we begin to help those and other circuits develop properly and thus significantly mitigate the deficits in autism?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…at an early time in brain development…” does not mean six years old. Dr. Anand was probably speaking about intrauterine development. In fact, Dr. Anand &lt;em&gt;doesn’t have any idea if this would work or not&lt;/em&gt; - he’s just speculating. Read the sentence again if you disagree with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the studies looking at acetylcholine receptor abnormalities in autism have shown problems with expression of the genes for the receptors themselves, not with neurexin-1-related proteins. In fact, even the study linking neurexin-1 disruption to autism found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A scan of the NRXN1 coding sequence in a cohort of ASD subjects, relative to non-ASD controls, revealed that amino acid alterations in neurexin 1 are not present at high frequency in ASD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These facts together suggest that treating autistic children with nicotine patches is not likely to help them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what are the &lt;em&gt;risks&lt;/em&gt; of treating young children with nicotine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, nicotine is an &lt;em&gt;addictive drug&lt;/em&gt;. Parents who recoil at the thought of giving their children Ritalin (methylphenidate) because it is addictive should contemplate this fact carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, nicotine withdrawal causes anxiety, irritability and aggressive behaviors. Will this lead parents to believe that the nicotine patch is “working” because their children are so much worse when they don’t get their “fix”? I suspect it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we don’t have a lot of information about how nicotine affects childhood development, largely because few children - prior to now - have become addicted to nicotine before their early teens. Once again, parents of autistic children are queing up to have their kids &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/169/"&gt;turned into guinea pigs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance of benefits is extremely low and the risk of bad outcomes is significant (nearly a certainty, given what we know about nicotine in adults). In addition, the symptoms of withdrawal in nicotine-addicted autistic people are likely to be misinterpreted by parents (and many “alternative” practitioners) as signs that the nicotine patch “works” to treat autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should ”just say no” to giving nicotine to autistic children. Not just because nicotine is an addictive drug, but also because it’s a poorly thought-out idea with no data to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most grammatical six-word sequences are very rare.  That is one of the things that made &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003066.html"&gt;Kaavya Viswanathan's plagiarism&lt;/a&gt; so easy to spot. For a six-word phrase to be moderately common it has to be a fixed phrase of some kind, such as a cliché, an idiom, or a proverb.  I made up the six-word phrase &lt;tt&gt;"before anyone had even noticed it"&lt;/tt&gt; literally at random, and Googled it, and got only a single hit in all of the web&amp;#39;s trillion words.  But shooting rampages by suicidal maniacs have become so common (there was another one in Alabama yesterday) that &amp;quot;before turning the gun on himself&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;before turning his gun on himself&amp;quot; have become commonly encountered clichés in news sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I don't give actual numbers is that it is hard to establish accurately&lt;br&gt;
how many times a phrase occurs, using Google.  (A commenter who signs himself Forrest below explains why.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a weird and horrible coincidence, while I was writing this post (which I have entirely rewritten because it was so badly misunderstood in its first draft), unknown to me, a new shooting rampage was occurring in Winnenden, near Stuttgart, in Germany.  The gunman must have been committing suicide just about the time I first posted.  And sure enough, in the &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/4975030/Germany-school-shootings-Teachers-sacrificed-themselves-to-save-pupils.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; account of it&lt;/a&gt; the phrase "before turning the gun on himself" turns up once again (in a reference to an earlier incident in 2002).  The &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7938402.stm"&gt;BBC News website&lt;/a&gt; uses the phrase yet again, referring to a 2006 incident in Germany.  The &lt;a href="http://www.itv.com/News/Articles/Teenage-killer-caught-on-camera-907819511.html"&gt;ITV News site&lt;/a&gt; uses the phrase of the Winnenden massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the comments that piled up below the original draft of this post  simply cited phrases, or lists of phrases, that get huge numbers of hits.  This was disappointing, not only because the result is boring, and didn't quite connect with my point, but also because it diluted the pool, so the three or four really interesting comments were hard to find.  I have done a ruthless cull, and deleted all the ones that merely cited a phrase and said how many hits it got.  (I probably should have deleted more.  See the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?page_id=72"&gt;Language Log Comments Policy&lt;/a&gt;.  It is not incumbent upon us to host in our comments area any random observation that floats across your mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that phrases with high hit counts can be found if you go for formulaic ways of saying things that are often said (like &amp;quot;Email this page to a friend&amp;quot;).  There are so many six-word phrases in English that there is room for thousands of them to have become clichés or otherwise familiar expressions.  One commenter cited &amp;quot;of the United States of America&amp;quot;, for example (this is really two or three lexical items rather than six: it has the same syntax as &amp;quot;of the USA&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;of France&amp;quot;) — an even more deeply boring example than the many others.  But even if there are thousands of high-hit-count six-word phrases, it can still be the case (and almost certainly is) that &lt;b&gt;most&lt;/b&gt; six-word phrases are very rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my main observation here is not about the rarity of arbitrary phrases.  It is about the sad fact of this one having been called upon so often, as school massacres go on and on racking up their victim tallies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

This was part of &lt;a href="http://whyscience.co.uk/"&gt;a much larger project&lt;/a&gt; started by Alom Shaha in London, to show people, well, why science is important. He got lots of scientists and educators to make videos or write comments on the topic, and they’re fascinating to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now Alom has created a video wrapping all this together. It’s very well done, and well worth your time to watch. There were any number of times I found myself smiling goofily at how wonderful this is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A FOUR-WEEK-OLD girl in northern NSW has died in intensive care after contracting whooping cough, sparking official alarm over a worsening epidemic of the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free booster shots are being offered to new parents, grandparents and carers of young children in the state in a bid to protect babies too young to have had immunisations of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are also calling on doctors to bring forward new babies’ first whooping cough jabs. The immunisations are usually given in three doses, at two, four and six months, but NSW Health is asking GPs and parents to consider bringing the first shot forward to six weeks as a result of the latest death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSW Health officials said in a statement last night that the baby girl was admitted to an unnamed hospital on the state’s north coast last week, but died on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed to be the first case of a baby dying from whooping cough in NSW since at least 2000, and nationally since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;———&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babies of four weeks are too young to be immunised for whooping cough, however they are more likely to catch it if other people around them are not. This is a very sad example of the damage done by the likes of The Australian Vaccination Network. I &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2009/02/28/the-anti-vacc-movement-an-australian-perspective/"&gt;blogged about this &lt;/a&gt;recently and reported on it for The Skeptic Zone podcast &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;number 19&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on this story as news comes to hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.counterminds.com/2009/03/darwin-issue-of-magazine-is-banned-in.html" title=""&gt;Darwin issue of a magazine is banned in Turkey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The title summarizes all the lunacy at once. After all the censorship towards evolution (and many other things), Turkish government finally took a giant step -backwards- for all mankind and blocked the whole issue of a scientific magazine.

&lt;p&gt;Darwin is now completely banned in Turkey. What a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note that the above link belongs to RichardDawkins.net, which is another banned website in Turkey. Therefore readers from Turkey can not access it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the news, the cover of the biggest and oldest magazine called Bilim ve Teknik (Science and Tech) has been changed after the release has been completed and ready for printing, due to the decision made by the new Vice President of the institution: Omer Cebeci PhD. Omer Cebeci was just assigned to that position when the government decided to be in charge of all the scientific institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuibguy.com/?p=175" title=""&gt;Banning Darwin In Turkey&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Turkey is an American ally in the bridge between Europe and the Middle East.  It is in a strategic location.  Turkey has been a secular country for most of a century, although largely Muslim by population.  Freedom of thought and speech was largely respected in Turkey (if not for the Kurds and the Greek Cypriots,) but at least in academia.  Turkey is moving dangerously towards a Muslim religious takeover of government, and most frightening is the censorship of science that embarrasses creationists.

&lt;p&gt;It may be the influence of Adnan Oktar, the sex criminal, whose idea of defending Islam is to spread lies about the facts of evolution.  People more familiar with Turkey, such as my reader Betul, can better analyze what is going on.  In fact, Betul sent me an e-mail alerting me to the censorship of a science and technology magazine whose entire issue was to have been devoted to the 200th birthday of Sir Charles Robert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.counterminds.com/2009/03/nature-on-turkeys-darwin-censorship.html" title=""&gt;Nature on Turkey's Darwin Censorship&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am glad Nature has put this issue out there. Read the article: Turkish Scientists Claim Darwin Censorship&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://snailstales.blogspot.com/2009/03/turkey-takes-another-step-in-its.html" title=""&gt;Turkey takes another step in its downward spiral towards Islamic fundamentalism&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Turkish newspapers (here and here), the journal Nature as well as Turkish bloggers (here and here) are reporting that TÜBITAK, the government-controlled science funding organization of Turkey has removed from the March issue of its own popular-science magazine Bilim ve Teknik (Science and Technology) an article about Charles Darwin and evolution. A planned cover featuring a picture of Darwin was also replaced.

&lt;p&gt;The blatant censorship was apparently ordered by TÜBİTAK's vice-president Ömer Cebeci. It's a sad occasion for Turkish science and the intellectual future of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://secularoutpost.infidels.org/2009/03/darwin-too-controversial-for-turkish.html" title=""&gt;Darwin too controversial for Turkish science magazine&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the US, creationism is a menace that can do real harm to science. But at least the US is not a Muslim country.

&lt;p&gt;In the latest news about creation and evolution from Turkey, it appears that the leading, government-supported popular science magazine in Turkey has been prevented from running a cover story on the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth. Ömer Cebeci, a high official in the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (who incidentally is an engineering Ph.D. from Iowa State University), intervened at the last minute to change the cover story and delete the 15 pages of Darwinian material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the news I've read, I'm having trouble reading between the lines to figure out what must have happened behind the scenes. Perhaps Cebeci is a creationist. Creationism is not uncommon among engineers, quite common among Muslim engineers, and very common indeed among Turkish officialdom under the current Islamist ruling party. On the other hand, it may just be an attempt to protect the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey from being associated with "controversial" ideas such as evolution, which may draw unwanted attention, or worse, budget cuts, from the Islamists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090310/full/news.2009.150.html" title=""&gt;Turkish scientists claim Darwin censorship&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The main Turkish government agency responsible for funding science has provoked outrage by apparently censoring a magazine article on the life and work of Charles Darwin.

&lt;p&gt;The article was stripped from the March issue of the widely read popular-science magazine Bilim ve Teknik (Science and Technology) just before it went to press. The magazine, which is published by Turkey's research funding and science management organization, TÜBİTAK, also switched a planned cover picture of Darwin for an illustration relating to global warming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/anti-evolution_censorship_in_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/tlFngJ3sRHQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236778505107"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clocking_cancer.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0670e0a66471b4e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock News"/><title type="html">Clocking Cancer</title><published>2009-03-11T14:01:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T14:01:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/pIHx-zaObIY/clocking_cancer.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clocking_cancer.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Les Lang at the UNC Medical Center News Office now writes a blog - &lt;a href="http://uncsom.wordpress.com/" title=""&gt;Hard Science&lt;/a&gt;. One recent post immediately caught my eye - &lt;a href="http://uncsom.wordpress.com/2009/02/17/clocking-cancer/" title=""&gt;Clocking Cancer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You might say that Dr. Aziz Sancar is trying to clock cancer. 

&lt;p&gt;In a nifty double play involving a pair of recent publications in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the Sarah Graham Kenan professor of biochemistry and biophysics at UNC found in one study that tinkering with the circadian clock can suppress cancer growth, and in the other he and his lab team presented molecular data  suggesting why timing just might be everything with regard to delivering chemotherapy for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both studies involve  the daily oscillatory rhythms of the cellular repair machinery. The main driver of these rhythms  is the circadian clock, which keeps the biological, behavioral and physiological processes on a  24-hour cycle.  Every cell in the body has its own internal clock, and each is synchronized by one master clock, located in a neuronal cluster in the brain. (No wonder we feel wound up sometimes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latter research, the Sancar team found that the ability of the cellular repair sytem known as nucleotide excision repair is linked to the circadian clock.  Repair ability is  at a minimum in the early morning and reaches a maximum in the evening hours. Moreover, this daily dance is due to changes in the levels of just one of six repair machinery components,  an enzyme, at different times of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Of importance here is that the repair machinery in question usually fixes damage to DNA caused by chemotherapy or UV radiation exposure.  So although the study involved murine brain tissue,  chemotherapy delivery may be best early in the morning (6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr.Sankar explains the study in this video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea is that there is a huge backlog of papers detailing negative results that people are gagging to get out if only there was somewhere to publish them. Unfortunately there are several problems with this. The first is that actually writing a paper is hard work. Most academics I know do not have the problem of not having anything to publish, they have the problem of getting around to writing the papers, sorting out the details, making sure that everything is in good shape. This leads to the second problem, that getting a negative result to a standard worthy of publication is much harder than for a positive result. You only need to make that compound, get that crystal, clone that gene, get the microarray to work once and you've got the data to analyse for publication. To show that it doesn't work you need to repeat several times, make sure your statistics are in order, and establish your working condition. Partly this is a problem with the standards we apply to recording our research; designing experiments so that negative results are well established is not high on many scientists' priorities. But partly it is the nature of beast. Negative results need to be much more tightly bounded to be useful .

&lt;p&gt;---------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally my personal belief is that the vast majority of "negative results" and other journals that are trying to expand the set of publishable work will not succeed. This is precisely because they are pushing the limits of the "publish through journal" approach by setting up a journal. To succeed these efforts need to embrace the nature of the web, to act as a web-native resource, and not as a printed journal that happens to be viewed in a browser. This does two things, it reduces the barrier to authors submitting work, making the project more likely to be successful, and it can also reduce costs. It doesn't in itself provide a business model, nor does it provide quality assurance, but it can provide a much richer set of options for developing both of these that are appropriate to the web. Routes towards quality assurance are well established, but suffer from the ongoing problem of getting researchers involved in the process, a subject for another post. Micropublication might work through micropayments, the whole lab book might be hosted for a fee with a number of "publications" bundled in, research funders may pay for services directly, or more interestingly the archive may be able to sell services built over the top of the data, truly adding value to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sennoma.net/main/archives/2009/03/fooling_around_with_numbers.php" title=""&gt;Fooling around with numbers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Interesting, no? If the primary measure of a journal's value is its impact -- pretty layouts and a good Employment section and so on being presumably secondary -- and if the Impact Factor is a measure of impact, and if publishers are making a good faith effort to offer value for money -- then why is there no apparent relationship between IF and journal prices? After all, publishers tout the Impact Factors of their offerings whenever they're asked to justify their prices or the latest round of increases in same.

&lt;p&gt;There's even some evidence from the same dataset that Impact Factors do influence journal pricing, at least in a "we can charge more if we have one" kinda way. Comparing the prices of journals with or without IFs indicates that, within this Elsevier/Life Sciences set, journals with IFs are higher priced and less variable in price:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sennoma.net/main/archives/2009/03/fooling_around_with_numbers_pa.php" title=""&gt;Fooling around with numbers, part 2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relationship here is still weak, but noticeably stronger than for the other two comparisons -- particularly once we eliminate the Nature outlier (see inset). I've seen papers describing 0.4 as "strong correlation", but I think for most purposes that's wishful thinking on the part of the authors. I do wish I knew enough about statistics to be able to say definitively whether this correlation is significantly greater than those in the first two figures. (Yes yes, I could look it up. The word you want is "lazy", OK?) Even if the difference is significant, and even if we are lenient and describe the correlation between IF and online use as "moderate", I would argue that it's a rich-get-richer effect in action rather than any evidence of quality or value. Higher-IF journals have better name recognition, and researchers tend to pull papers out of their "to-read" pile more often if they know the journal, so when it comes time to write up results those are the papers that get cited. Just for fun, here's the same graph with some of the most-used journals identified by name:&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/correlation_is_not_causation_w.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/h1yh931uOlo" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236777090424"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6411">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07b4dec92f65b44e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 3.11</title><published>2009-03-11T13:00:31Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T13:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=6411" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

These include logical and clear thinking, unambiguous definitions, and internal consistency. In fact it is demonstrably true that opposing science often equates to promoting muddied and sloppy thinking, ambiguous language, and self-contradiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I wrote about that latter virtue - consistency - and its lack when dealing with regulating physicians vs regulating so-called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In fact CAM exists, in my opinion, specifically to create a double-standard to disguise contradictory standards. It is institutionalized compartmentalization to minimize public cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, as promised, I will discuss how the same double standard has been made to apply to the regulation of supplements vs pharmaceuticals. The recently published Government Accountability Office &lt;a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09250.pdf"&gt;(GAO) report on supplement regulation&lt;/a&gt; by the FDA brings this to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DSHEA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, supplement regulation is primarily determined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), which is an amendment of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The purpose of DSHEA was to limit FDA power to regulate supplements and to expand the definition of “supplement.” Here we see the first internal contradiction. The GAO report states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DSHEA defines dietary supplements as products that, among other things, are intended for ingestion to supplement the diet, labeled as a dietary supplement, and not represented as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or diet. They must also contain one or more dietary ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSHEA also states that herbs and other botanical are to be considered supplements.  Botanicals, however, are not dietary supplements. They are taken not for their nutritional value but for their pharmacological effects. Herbs and botanicals are simply one form of drugs. Vitamins and minerals are nutritional supplements; echinacea is a collection of chemicals, some of which may be pharmacologically active, but with no or trivial nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The GRAS Is Always Greener&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justification for regulating herbal drugs as nutritional supplements derives, it seems, from the concept of GRAS - which stands for “generally recognized as safe.”  FDA regulations state that for supplements and food additives companies do not have to prove safety if the ingredient is GRAS and if it was in use prior to 1994. Any totally new ingredient must be studied for safety (which makes sense as a new ingredient has not been around long enough to be considered GRAS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument is that herbs that have been around for a long time are generally recognized as safe and therefore should not suffer the burden of having to prove safety prior to marketing. However, it is not always true that herbal supplements have been in use for very long, especially not as they are currently marketed. And even for those that have been around for centuries, subtle risks and toxicity would not be necessarily generally recognized without controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example I think is very relevant is that of VIOXX, which was pulled from the market because studies showed that it significantly increased heart attacks in those at risk. This was enough to generate a scandal. And yet, without large post-marketing clinical trials this increased statistical risk would never have come to light.  We cannot say with any confidence that any herbal supplement does not carry a similar risk - the GRAS standard is simply not sufficient for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRAS is reasonable when it comes to food and true supplements. Companies should not have to conduct clinical trials prior to adding salt, corn oil, chocolate, or other common ingredients to their food products. The GRAS standard is sufficient for this. But I do not think it properly applies to taking an botanical drug for a medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAO report also noted that companies are responsible for determining whether or not an ingredient falls under GRAS, and they are under no obligation to report this to the FDA (although some do voluntarily). This means the FDA may not even hear about food or supplement ingredients if the companies themselves felt they were GRAS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety, Efficacy, and the GAO Report&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAO report looks at current FDA effectiveness in regulating the safety and educating the public about the science of supplements under DSHEA. It is interesting to note that the GAO report does not question a central fact of DSHEA - that the FDA has no role in regulating the claims made for supplement products. This, in my opinion, is a major failure of DSHEA. Regulating marketing claims has been left entirely to regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commision (FTC), which can go after supplement marketers for commercial fraud. However, FTC fines have been little more than a slap on the wrist, and they have no authority to pull products themselves from the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA regulation of claims was reduced with another double-standard contradiction - so-called structure/function claims. Under DSHEA companies are free to make whatever structure/function claims they wish. These are claims that a supplement or ingredient improves a structure or function of the body. Companies are not allowed to claim that their product treats or cures a disease. However, it did not take long for companies to figure out that they could restate disease claims as structure/function claims to skirt the FDA. For example, a company may claim that their product promotes a positive mood, but they cannot say it treats depression. Or they may say it boosts the immune system (which is important for fighting cancer -wink, wink, nod, nod), but they may not say it cures cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result has been an explosion of unregulated supplement claims, and a growing supplement market. The GAO report says the supplement industry grew to 23.7 billion dollars in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAO report does not question or recommend changes to this basic structure, which I think is fatally flawed. Rather their recommended solution is to increase FDA efforts to educate the public about the science of supplements. I am very much in support of efforts to educate the public. However, I do not hold out much hope that such efforts will have a significant effect. The supplement industry has billions of dollars with which to market their claims. The FDA is not likely to significantly impact upon this. It is also much easier to make claims that people want to believe rather than patiently explain that science does not support those claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding safety the GAO report makes a number of observations and conclusions. At present companies are required to report to the FDA severe adverse reactions to their products. They are not required to report mild or moderate adverse reactions, which are voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA cannot require safety testing prior to marketing. The FDA primarily uses after-marketing monitoring for safety, and the burden of proof is on them to show that a product is unsafe before they can pull it from the market. The only product so removed was ephedra, and that was 10 years after the FDA issued it first warning about the product and after thousands of people were harmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GAO report brings to light many of the current shortcomings of FDA regulations of supplements.  The FDA is underfunded and does not have the authority to properly regulate supplements and as a result, the GAO concludes, the public is insufficiently protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve safety regulation they recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. To improve the information available to FDA for identifying safety concerns and better enable FDA to meet its responsibility to protect the public health, we recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services direct the Commissioner of FDA to request authority to require dietary supplement companies to&lt;br&gt;
Recommendations for Executive Action&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; • identify themselves as a dietary supplement company as part of the existing registration requirements and update this information annually,&lt;br&gt;
• provide a list of all dietary supplement products they sell and a copy of the labels and update this information annually, and&lt;br&gt;
• report all adverse events related to dietary supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. To better enable FDA to meet its responsibility to regulate dietary supplements that contain new dietary ingredients, we recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services direct the Commissioner of FDA to issue guidance to clarify when an ingredient is considered a new dietary ingredient, the evidence needed to document the safety of new dietary ingredients, and appropriate methods for establishing ingredient identity.&lt;br&gt;
3. To help ensure that companies follow the appropriate laws and regulations and to renew a recommendation we made in July 2000, we recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services direct the Commissioner of FDA to provide guidance to industry to clarify when products should be marketed as either dietary supplements or conventional foods formulated with added dietary ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better regulate claims of efficacy for supplements they recommend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. To improve consumer understanding about dietary supplements and better leverage existing resources, we recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services direct the Commissioner of FDA to coordinate with stakeholder groups involved in consumer outreach to (1) identify additional mechanisms—such as the recent WebMD partnership—for educating consumers about the safety, efficacy, and labeling of dietary supplements; (2) implement these mechanisms; and (3) assess their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think these are all reasonable measures, my sense is that they do not go nearly far enough.  Perhaps they consider this a baby-step, making the best of the current regulations. However, there are core problems with DSHEA that need to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structure/function claims are a fiction - a manufactured loop-hole for supplement marketers. It should be done away with. Instead, any health claims made for supplements or food ingredients should be subjected to some form of FDA review prior to allowing the claims. Opponents of this typically appeal to a false dichotomy - pharmaceutical level regulation or no regulation. However, a middle-level of regulation is also an option. Existing scientific evidence can be reviewed and only claims that are sufficiently backed by evidence should be allowed in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of safety, I do not think the GRAS standard should apply to herbals and botanicals. They should, in fact, not be categorized as supplements at all. This would eliminate the problem of having companies classify their food additives as supplements to evade regulation. Rather, it makes more sense to create another category for botanical drugs. Evidence of both safety and efficacy should be required, but the same level of procedures for pharmaceuticals is not realistic.  An appropriate level of evidence can be mandated, but perhaps, for example, the FDA can allow use of prior research to establish their claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, even though DSHEA and the GAO report do not deal with this issue, while I am making recommendations to alter FDA regulation, I would eliminate approval for homeopathic substances. Their inclusion under FDA approval is anachronistic (not that it was ever justified) and is another glaring contradiction. Homeopathic substances are not supplements or drugs - they are nothing but water, lies, and pseudoscience. It is time FDA regulations reflected this demonstrable scientific fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the GAO recommendations would be a few baby steps in the right direction, much more substantive changes to FDA regulations are required to bring them into line with science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

Duchy Originals detox tincture is just one more of thousands of snake oil products being marketed to the public with dubious health claims. Except this one is backed by the Prince of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The con is an old one - virtually random ingredients are put into a pill, elixir, tincture, or salve and sold with incredible hype but no science. So-called snake oil marketers have a long tradition of knowing their marks and the market. Claims are designed to appeal to the broadest market, to have maximal allure, and to be just vague enough to evade any pesky regulations that may be in effect. Claims also tend to follow recent fads, using the buzz-words that are hot, and often try to wrap cutting-edge sciency terms in the cloak of ancient wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and celebrity or pseudoauthoritarian endorsements help, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is marketing their product as a detoxifier. This is the latest buzz word for snake-oil. The claim is that such products help the body eliminate toxins. Of course, the specific toxins are typically not named, and no plausible mechanism for removing the unnamed toxins can be given. The body’s own detoxification processes, such as the liver and kidneys, do just fine without any help in most circumstances. When a real toxin cannot be handled by the body then real disease is usually the result, and treatments, when available, are specific. Vague references to toxins and detoxification, however, are pure nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edzard Ernst, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7934568.stm"&gt;as reported by the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, is very critical of the claims made for their detox tincture by Duch Originals, and supported by Prince Charles. He says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nothing would, of course, be easier than to demonstrate that detox products work. All one needed to do is to take a few blood samples from volunteers and test whether this or that toxin is eliminated from the body faster than normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But where are the studies that demonstrate efficacy? They do not exist, and the reason is simple: these products have no real detoxification effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite true. Ernst is an interesting character. He is the UK’s first professor of complementary medicine. He started out quite fond of the notion of complementary and alternative medicine and set out to study CAM modalities scientifically. What he found, however, is that no so-called CAM modality has been established by adequate scientific evidence, and many have already been disproven. He wrote the book &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=195"&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/a&gt;: Alternative Medicine on Trial, with Simon Singh - a harsh criticism of CAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So despite his ideological leanings he was intellectually honest enough to listen to the evidence.  I think Prince Charles could use of dose of Professor Ernst’s Miraculous Elixir of Honesty. If only such a product existed.&lt;/p&gt;

Whatever the sins of big pharma (and they are legion), this claim is, of course, a whole lot of hooey. If there is a double standard (and, indeed there is), it favors CAM. Indeed, CAM itself is a "wedge strategy" to apply a favorable double standard to modalities that are either ineffective or, although strictly speaking unproven, highly unlikely to be effective based on our understanding of science and prior probability alone. Scientific medicine has to jump through many hoops, including scientific plausibility, biochemical and cell culture studies, animal models, and, finally, randomized clinical trials; in contrast, we are told that we should "respect" CAM modalities and that they should be permitted by "tradition," regardless of whether there's any science whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area where this double standard is glaringly apparent is in the regulation of supplements by the Food and Drug Administration. Among the hodge-podge mish-mash of divergent and sometimes mutually contradictory modalities that have found a home under the "big tent" of CAM, there are two areas that come to mind that might actually produce more than placebo effects. The first are herbal medicines, which, being raw plant extracts, are in reality nothing more than impure drugs with variable purity and activity--if drug there is in them. It's basically the way medicine was practiced a couple of hundred years or more ago, and there really is nothing "alternative" about medicines derived from natural products. Indeed, there is a whole perfectly scientifically respectable field of pharmacology devoted to natural products known as pharmacognosy, whose cooptation as "alternative" by the woo that is CAM is one of the biggest crimes against science ever committed. This second area of CAM that might produce actual effects is the area of dietary supplements, for the same reasons, given that many of them are based on plant extracts. Others, of course, are simply vitamins, all too often taken in much higher doses than ever recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's where the double standard comes in. Since 1994, dietary supplements have been almost immune from regulation by the FDA, thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/DSHEA.html"&gt;Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994&lt;/a&gt; (DSHEA), which created a new class of regulated entities known as dietary supplements and &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html"&gt;liberalized the sorts of information&lt;/a&gt; that supplement manufacturers could transmit to the public. The end result was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It [the DSHEA] also expanded the types of products that could be marketed as "supplements." The most logical definition of "dietary supplement" would be something that supplies one or more essential nutrients missing from the diet. DSHEA went far beyond this to include vitamins; minerals; herbs or other botanicals; amino acids; other dietary substances to supplement the diet by increasing dietary intake; and any concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any such ingredients. Although many such products (particularly herbs) are marketed for their alleged preventive or therapeutic effects, the 1994 law has made it difficult or impossible for the FDA to regulate them as drugs. Since its passage, even hormones, such as DHEA and melatonin, are being hawked as supplements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the DSHEA largely allows the use of the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/03/quack_miranda_warning.php"&gt;Quack Miranda warning&lt;/a&gt;" to avoid FDA scrutiny. It in essence neutered the FDA, making it very hard for it to regulate so-called dietary supplements, even when potentially dangerous. In brief, it (mostly) exempts from regulation compounds "generally recognized as safe" if they were in widespread use before 1994. While this is reasonable for true foods, such as corn, wheat, or other ingredients, a lot of supplements are have pharmacologically active ingredients. Worse, the DSHEA allows manufacturers to make "structure/function" claims. Specifically, the law allows dietary supplements to bear "statements of support" for (a) a benefit for classical nutrient deficiency disease; (b) a description of how ingredients affect the structure or function of the body, organs, or cells; (c) the documented mechanism by which the ingredients act to maintain structure or function; and (d) general well-being from consumption of the ingredients. As &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html"&gt;Quackwatch&lt;/a&gt; points out, the statement "calcium builds strong bones and teeth" is a classic example of an allowable structure/function statement for a food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, supplement manufacturers often go far beyond such uncontroversial statements claims of curing all sorts of disease, albeit usually in the form of postulated vague benefits, all communciated with a "nudge, nudge, wink, wink" that lets the people buying them know what the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; health claims are. For science- and evidence-based medicine, the DSHEA has been an unmitigated disaster, although the quacks sure do like it because before a supplement can be removed from the market the burden of proof is on the FDA to show that the supplement is dangerous, not on the manufacturer to show that it's safe, as is the case for drugs. That's one reason why it was so difficult to get ephedra off the market; indeed, it was a decade after the first advisory before the FDA could finally pull ephedra from the market--and then only after thousands of adverse events and several deaths. Can you imagine the reaction that would have occurred if such a delay had occurred for a pharmaceutical product with exactly the same number of adverse events?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the DSHEA is so much of a problem that even under the Bush Administration, the Government Accoountability Office (GAO) commissioned a report on dietary supplements, which was released in January of this year. The report, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09250.pdf"&gt;Dietary Supplements: The FDA Should Take Further Actions to Improve Oversight and Consumer Understanding&lt;/a&gt; presents evidence of a real problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/will_the_government_ever_regulate_supple.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/will_the_government_ever_regulate_supple.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/O5w0u5m4tMA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236761887963"><id gr:original-id="http://holfordwatch.info/?p=3779">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd0e2999a9d34201</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Patrick Holford, Still Claiming IgG Levels Are Relevant to Food Intolerance and Weight Loss</title><published>2009-03-11T08:17:49Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T08:17:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://holfordwatch.info/2009/03/11/patrick-holford-still-claiming-igg-levels-are-relevant-to-food-intolerance-and-weight-loss/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Patrick Holford claims that food intolerance is linked to resistant weight loss.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bill Clinton actually used signing documents way more than George W. Bush. But No. 42 is a Democrat and his wife currently works for Obama. So No. 44 is on a big tear right now to distance himself instead from No. 43, the Republican, who's back in Texas and doesn't care but just hearing his name trashed makes Democrats feel good. (See, also more Bush distancing in The Ticket on today's stem cell changes here.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B-b-b-b-ut!!!!???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/04/30/bush_challenges_hundreds_of_laws/" title=""&gt;Bush challenges hundreds of laws&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Bush has quietly claimed the authority to disobey more than 750 laws enacted since he took office, asserting that he has the power to set aside any statute passed by Congress when it conflicts with his interpretation of the Constitution.

&lt;p&gt;Among the laws Bush said he can ignore are military rules and regulations, affirmative-action provisions, requirements that Congress be told about immigration services problems, ''whistle-blower" protections for nuclear regulatory officials, and safeguards against political interference in federally funded research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal scholars say the scope and aggression of Bush's assertions that he can bypass laws represent a concerted effort to expand his power at the expense of Congress, upsetting the balance between the branches of government. The Constitution is clear in assigning to Congress the power to write the laws and to the president a duty ''to take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Bush, however, has repeatedly declared that he does not need to ''execute" a law he believes is unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_03/017224.php" title=""&gt;NOT EVEN CLOSE....&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, this wasn't written by the Republican National Committee to be read on-air by Fox News personalities; it just seems like it.

&lt;p&gt;Did Clinton use signing statements "way more than George W. Bush"? It's a highly misleading claim, based on a count of the individual documents, instead of the number of provisions to which the signing statements have been applied. In reality, Bush "broke all records" while abusing this presidential tool, "using signing statements to challenge about 1,200 sections of bills over his eight years in office, about twice the number challenged by all previous presidents combined."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hear Malcolm tell it, President Obama is just playing a silly partisan game, "trashing" Bush when Clinton was worse, just to make Democrats "feel good." This is lazy, partisan, and disingenuous analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, Obama didn't rule out the use of signing statements, which Malcolm concludes makes yesterday's announcement "change to sort-of believe in." This, again, is misleading. Obama's decision is entirely in line with historic presidential authority. The problem isn't with the signing statements themselves -- the practice has been around for nearly 200 years -- but with Bush's unprecedented abuse of the presidential tool. The 43rd president took the practice to new heights (or depths, as the case may be), using signing statements to ignore parts of laws he didn't like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Obama might, at some point, use signing statements is not controversial, and certainly doesn't point to more of the same. Why Andrew Malcolm is arguing otherwise is a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-signing-statements10-2009mar10,0,357503.story" title=""&gt;Obama orders review of Bush's signing statements&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He signaled that, unlike Bush, he would not use signing statements to do end runs around Congress.

&lt;p&gt;According to one count, Bush issued 161 signing statements in which he cast doubt on more than 1,000 provisions in legislation and essentially stated his intention to ignore those parts of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former President Clinton issued significantly more signing statements, but Bush was more aggressive in making claims that the legislation in question would undermine presidential authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bush's signing statements were viewed by many critics, Republican and Democratic alike, as another attempt to expand the scope of presidential power. Bush didn't publicize them, however, and for much of his presidency, the public was largely unaware of this practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Thursday, the non-profit investigative journalism outfit ProPublica named Amanda Michel its first "editor of distributed reporting." Her title alone suggests the future of news gathering, and so does her background: Michel was director of The Huffington Post's citizen-journalism effort, Off the Bus, which enlisted 12,000 volunteers to cover the 2008 presidential campaign.

&lt;p&gt;Michel wrote a must-read account of the project for Columbia Journalism Review, and she expounded on the experience in an hour-long interview with me on Thursday evening. She would probably be the first to argue that there are no ironclad rules in this game, so I hope she excuses this distillation of our conversation into five tips for running a successful citizen-journalism operation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;First and foremost, the show is a critique of the media. It is not "fake news." It is not "funny riffs on the headlines," a la "Weekend Update." It is a lampoon of media excess. As any veteran watcher can tell you, it has ALWAYS been "attacking people like [Cramer]." George W. Bush was just value-added content.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/10/AR2009031000793.html" title=""&gt;Howard Kurtz&lt;/a&gt; goes further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If you think Jon Stewart is merely funny, you're missing the point.

&lt;p&gt;The Comedy Central guy is one of the sharpest media critics around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know he feels strongly about the shortcomings of the news business -- and who doesn't? -- because I've interviewed him about it, and the one time I was on the "Daily Show," he carried on at some length, long past the allotted time for our discussion. Only the studio audience got to see that part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to his young army of TiVo sleuths, Stewart comes up with tape that either a) makes journalists look slightly ridiculous, or b) shows that they don't know what the hell they're talking about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/jon_stewart_is_not_a_comedian.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/d9M-Zy9M8eE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236755835504"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/a_lovely_article_about_science.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5efe9c72ca6957b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SO'09"/><title type="html">A lovely article about ScienceOnline'09</title><published>2009-03-11T06:45:14Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T06:45:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/YO2Gc9t77g8/a_lovely_article_about_science.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/a_lovely_article_about_science.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Written by Allen Dodson in ASBMB Today: &lt;a href="http://www.asbmbtoday-digital.com/asbmbtoday/200903/?pg=34" title=""&gt;Communicating Science in an Online World&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Also in the Sunday edition, however, was the paper's long-demanded interview with Obama, which the Times somewhat arrogantly considers its birthright with every new president. The reporters used the opportunity to learn a few things about Obama's work and goals. But in the process one reporter, Peter Baker, asked one of the most idiotic questions I've ever heard from a reputable news organization. He asked if Obama was a socialist, and then, when Obama said no, followed up with, "Is there anything wrong with saying yes?" Obama, for his part, called the paper later to say he couldn't believe the paper was "entirely serious." That's more polite than the journalists deserved.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/white-house-watch/2009/03/the_capitalist-in-chief.html" title=""&gt;The Capitalist-in-Chief&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's not easy to shock our famously unflappable president. But when Peter Baker of the New York Times asked Barack Obama during an interview on Air Force One on Friday if he was a socialist, that's exactly what happened.

&lt;p&gt;Obama initially replied with a denial and a largely boilerplate answer about his budget plan. But some 90 minutes later, he called the Times back to express his disbelief that the question was actually intended seriously, to castigate critics who have been using the term against him -- and to point out that it was George W. Bush, not he, who started buying up shares in banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was another lesson for Obama in the ways of Washington, where Republican calumnies still make it into the mainstream political discourse with alarming ease.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/when_nytimes_shills_for_the_ri.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/Hrtg4hzVXWY" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236755835504"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/green_and_gold_oa_complementar.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d42e9450da429705</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Open Science"/><title type="html">Green and Gold OA: complementary or competitive?</title><published>2009-03-11T06:21:47Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T06:21:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/OEpHTXVjj9I/green_and_gold_oa_complementar.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/green_and_gold_oa_complementar.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Richard Poynder asks an important question: &lt;a href="http://poynder.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-access-who-would-you-back.html" title=""&gt;Open and Shut?: Open Access: Who would you back?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an issue of intellectual curiosity alone: it has important strategic implications for the OA movement. It requires, for instance, that the movement decides whether to treat Green and Gold OA as complementary or competitive activities; and if they are competitive, then where the OA movement should focus its main efforts ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When users click from one page to another while looking through online scientific journals, they generate a chain of connections between things they think belong together. Now a billion such 'clickstream events' have been analysed by researchers to map these connections on a grand scale.

&lt;p&gt;The work provides a fascinating snapshot of the web of interconnections between disciplines, which some data-mining experts believe reveals the degree to which work that is not often cited -- including work in the social sciences and humanities -- is widely consulted and can form bridges between scientific disciplines...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...This statement by Deutsche Bank is an astonishing comment on the profitability of the industry.  The notion that Elsevier, and therefore the other commercial publishers, add "little value to the publishing process" and cannot justify the high profit margins is significant.  This statement by Deutsche Bank, while aimed towards investors, reveals the skepticism of investment analysts regarding the value that Elsevier, and therefore other firms with similar business models, claim to add to the publishing process.

&lt;p&gt;If the large publishers provide little value-added, what explains their apparently high profit margins and ability to consistently raise prices?  The first element that may account for the large publisher's profits is the concentration of the industry.  As noted, the top three publishers of scientific journals (Elsevier, Springer-Kluwer and Wiley-Blackwell) account for approximately 42% of all articles published.  Although there are over 2,000 publishers of academic journals, no other publisher beyond the big three accounts for more than a 3% share of the journal market.  Moreover, the big three control the most prestigious journals with the largest circulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the oligopolistic structure of the industry, rivalry between publishers is low (at least among the big three).  Rivalry is further attenuated because there is little direct competition between the individual journals produced by each publisher.  This is due to the specialized character of academic journals which are targeted to specific academic disciplines thus each journal has its own distinct target audience.  This is a form of product differentiation.  Moreover, the publishers that own prestigious journals are able to take advantage of another form of differentiation since faculty and libraries will always seek out the most influential journal within any given discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no more striking evidence of the power of the large academic publishers than the fact that two of the most important inputs to the production of a journal - the articles themselves and editorial review - are provided virtually free of charge to the publishers.  As seen in the business model, faculties have strong incentives to produce articles and participate in editorial reviews, activities that are promoted both by the values of the profession and academic tenure and review procedures.  Academic journals are the primary means for disseminating scholarly work and this fact places the journal publishers in a uniquely powerful position.  Although they may not provide a great deal of value through their operational activities as illustrated by the Deutsche Bank analysis, they occupy a strategic position in the current business model by controlling the flow of scholarly exchange necessary to the process of knowledge creation.  In the current model, faculty members are more dependent upon the publishers than the publishers are on faculty members.  The dependency is increased by the fact that there are a relatively large number of faculty members seeking an outlet for their scholarly output compared to the number of journals available within any academic discipline....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Our speaker is Dr. David Reif from the US Environmental Protection Agency. That evening we will be talking about the interplay between our genetic makeup and our environment &amp;amp; lifestyles.  We will also discuss human genetics with a focus on evolutionary theory.  Here is a link (http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1879213,00.html#) to an interesting article by a popular author, Carl Zimmer that you might find fun to read. The article gives some background on Darwin and the ideas behind his evolutionary theory as well as some new thoughts that scientists are having about genes and evolution.  If you are particularly interested in the writings of Charles Darwin, here is a link to his writings online (http://darwin-online.org.uk/).  I hope that many of you can come on the 24th - it should be a very interesting cafe that will give us a lot to talk about.

&lt;p&gt;Darwin lives on: how gene-environment interactions affect modern society&lt;br&gt;
Tuesday March 24, 2009&lt;br&gt;
6:30-8:30 p.m. with discussion beginning at 7:00 followed by Q&amp;amp;A&lt;br&gt;
Tir Na Nog 218 South Blount Street, Raleigh, 833-7795&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 150 years since Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species, there has been great debate (political, spiritual, and scientific) over the implications of natural selection for human beings: What does our shared evolutionary history have to do with common, complex diseases? How might genetics shape differential susceptibility to the multitude of chemicals--both manufactured and natural--present in the environment? How do modern lifestyles impact the evolutionary process? Join us as we discuss these and other questions concerning the interplay between our genes and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the Speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Reif earned his B.S. (Biology) from the College of William &amp;amp; Mary and both his M.S. (Statistics) and Ph.D. (Human Genetics) from Vanderbilt University. He is currently a Statistician in the National Center for Computational Toxicology at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Reif&amp;#39;s research focuses on novel statistical and bioinformatical strategies for human health and environmental toxicology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, these scientists were able to demonstrate that the coevolutionary process is dependent on ecological conditions. Indeed, under certain conditions, the prey becomes resistant to the predator, which itself evolves so that it can attack this new prey. In addition, the scientists issued a warning against the previously envisaged use of this predator (&lt;em&gt;Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus&lt;/em&gt;) as a “living antibiotic” because, like other antibiotics, this could lead to the selection of resistant pathogenic bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm, I wonder what excuse the creationists will come up with to deny this. They’ll probably use the old, it wasn’t a species change gambit, claiming to be perfectly okay with variation and mutation so long as the species (pretty much an vague and almost arbitrarily label) hasn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4965405/Autistic-girl-shut-in-cramped-room-after-getting-upset-at-school.html"&gt;Telegraph&lt;/a&gt; reported that 8-year-old Melanie-Rose Wichmann was discriminated against on the basis of her disability (she is on the autism spectum). School staff at  John Fisher Roman Catholic Primary School in Perivale, West London have been ordered to apologize after shutting her in a 16ft by 7ft medical room "when she burst into tears and started waving her arms around because she feared she would be punished for not doing her homework." Kept in the room for up to ten minutes, Melanie-Rose has suffered from anxiety attacks since February of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every case like Melanie-Rose's that gets reported, one suspects there's more than go unnoted and unnoticed. There's been calls for an end to the use of &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/school_is_not_supposed_to_hurt_3_against_physical_restraints_amp_padded_rooms"&gt;physical restraints and timeout rooms&lt;/a&gt; for special education students. Parent blogger &lt;a href="http://nomoseclusion.blogspot.com/"&gt;Ange&lt;/a&gt; has started a &lt;a href="http://nomoseclusion.blogspot.com/"&gt;grassroots campaign&lt;/a&gt; in Missouri to &lt;a href="http://nomoseclusion.blogspot.com/"&gt;end the use of these inhumane practices&lt;/a&gt; and especially for students with disabilities. Another parent blogger, &lt;a href="http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/03/thinking-outside-box.html"&gt;Club 166&lt;/a&gt;, wrote about why we really need to &lt;a href="http://club166.blogspot.com/2009/03/thinking-outside-box.html"&gt;think outside the box&lt;/a&gt; and stop seeing restraints and seclusion as the "best alternative" and, indeed, an "acceptable" practice in an educational setting, and for special education students in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hears too many accounts of physical restraints and seclusion in the form of timeout rooms and/or padded rooms that some school district somewhere must be signing off on the use (the misuse....) of such practices. Having seen the effects of physical restraints---the infamous basket hold on my son----I find it baffling to think anyone could condone the use os such "methods." But the Spring 2009 &lt;a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/Timeout.html"&gt;Education Next&lt;/a&gt; (a publication of the &lt;a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/ednext/Timeout.html"&gt;Hoover Institute&lt;/a&gt;) describes how one New Mexico school district was charged with violating the Constitution when timeouts were used to "control a violent child." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August of 2008, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that when the &lt;a href="http://idea.ed.gov"&gt;Individual with Disabilities Education Act&lt;/a&gt; (IDEA) is followed "to the letter," school officials may actually be protected from liability in regard to the use of timeout rooms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.C. in 2002 was six years old, profane, and violent. He hit furniture and threatened to kill students and teachers with hot oil. Having judged him “emotionally disturbed,” school officials had placed him in a special education program and prepared an Individualized Education Plan in consultation with his mother, who signed it. Teachers were obliged to follow the plan and report to his mother daily. Among the techniques of “behavioral intervention” prescribed were supervised timeouts in a timeout room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a visit, Ms. Couture objected to the characteristics of the room: “very small” with “carpeting, but no padding on the walls. Nothing in it.... It had a very dim light.” In an administrative appeal to a hearing officer, she also complained of “inappropriate reliance upon timeouts and physical restraints.” Defeated there, she complained to the district court under section 1983 of the U.S. Code, which individual litigants often use in an effort to show that state or local officials have deprived them of constitutional or federal statutory rights. The district court was troubled by the length of some of the timeouts and what seemed on occasion to be insufficient provocation on M.C.’s part, such as refusing to take his spelling test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuit court, questioning the district court’s mode of analysis, found that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. Even if putting M.C. in the timeout room were considered a seizure—a question that the court declined to decide—it was not unreasonable. The court expressed sympathy both for Ms. Couture and the teachers, but ruled that “The Fourth Amendment...does not empower federal courts to displace educational authorities regarding the formulation and enforcement of pedagogical norms.... If we do not allow teachers to rely on a plan specifically approved by the student’s parents and which they are statutorily required to follow, we will put teachers in an impossible position—exposed to litigation no matter what they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless: The court acknowledged that the use of timeout rooms did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; improve M.C.'s behavior. Whether or not using a timeout room was a "good or effective teaching method" was not considered "'relevant'"---puzzling; one would think that it is all too "relevant" that a school district use teaching methods that are "effective" if not "good" in teaching its students. The court ruled that the use of timeout rooms was "'primarily a pedagogical judgment for the educators on the spot to make.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the school officials in New Mexico not realize the severity of using a timeout room? Or the potential for traumatizing a child (and a 6-year-old child at that) using such a practice? Was the timeout room used too much, for any behavior issue, as is suggested by the court's noting that M.C. was placed in the timeout room for "refusing to take his spelling test"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that M.C.'s mother had signed the IEP is crucial to note. Was she adequately informed of other methods to help M.C. with difficult behaviors? Was she informed that she had 15 days to review the IEP and consider the methods to be used? Was there a clearly written &lt;a href="http://www.bridges4kids.org/articles/2003/1-03/LukerFBA1-13-03.html"&gt;Behavior Intervention Plan&lt;/a&gt; that carefully presented not only how the timeout room would be used, but how educators would teach M.C. alternate ways to communicate his frustrations and needs, so that the use of the timeout room might, gradually and eventually, be lessened?&lt;/p&gt;

I'll be honest that I'm not entirely happy with how the post turned out (I don't know that it fits the title, for instance, and I never really got to the point), but I also think it's an honest examination of my somewhat-muddled and uninformed thought process on the matter. My point is that I'd like to get as many corrections, elaborations, and other responses as possible, so feel free (nay, encouraged) to leave comments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;The comment thread on &lt;a href="http://atheistexperience.blogspot.com/2009/03/do-moderate-christians-enable.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; at the Atheist Experience blog got too long, too fast, for me to weigh in on the subject there. It's something I've given some thought to (but not enough to keep this post from rambling, I'm afraid), so I'm going to write about it here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conventional wisdom says that the fundamentalist, conservative, literalist Christians have the more legitimate claim to the label of Christianity--that they are more the "True Christians" than the liberals and moderates. Conversely, conventional wisdom says that the moderates are the more reasonable Christians, recognizing that the Bible is the product of humans at a particular time, and thus tailoring their beliefs to a changed (and changing) society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think either one of these is quite the case--at the very least, I don't think that's the whole story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, there's the conservatives' claim to being the "True Christians," interpreting the bible "literally" and trumpeting mantras like "God said it, I believe it" and so forth. This notion--like the notion that conservative Christians have a monopoly on "family values" and are "traditional"--is one that the fundamentalists have worked very hard to cultivate. The "tradition" of modern conservatism, though it clearly has earlier roots, is really only about a century old--kind of gives the lie to "True Christianity," I would think. Wouldn't the Catholics have the most legitimate claim to that? Or the Greek Orthodox church? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2009/02/on-interpretation.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, there's no such thing as a "literal" interpretation of &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; text. The nature of communication makes it damn near impossible. The truth is that fundamentalist Christians and moderate-to-liberal Christians both approach the Bible in basically the same way: picking and choosing passages to cite in order to prop up their pre-existing beliefs. That particular bit reminds me of that Anne Lamott quotation: "You can safely assume that you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do." That applies on a broader level--each Christian has a different concept of God, based on some mish-mash combination of what they believe from (and about) the Bible, what they believe from their church and pulpits, what they believe from the culture, what they believe from personal experience, and what they think ought to be the case. Fundies tend to center on believing that God punishes the wicked, rewards the virtuous, and that the events and teachings in the Bible are more or less accurate--at least, the Old Testament, Revelation, Acts, and the bits written by Paul, anyway. Moderate and liberal Christians tend to seize more on the "loving God" motif, and believe that the "core" teachings of the Bible are valuable, even if some of the more specific bits are the products of outdated politics, dogma, and prejudice. This "core" is largely summed up in the Sermon on the Mount and some of the other red-letter bits, and such Christians use this to handwave away much of the Old Testament (except Psalms, Proverbs, and selected other bits) and some of the Pauline books (mostly the more misogynistic and homophobic parts). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't feel entirely informed enough to make this distinction, but I'm going to give it a try anyway. For the Dispensationalist Christian (like Tim LaHaye), it seems that the focal point of the Bible is Revelation, and the primary Gospel is Matthew--because it's the one &lt;strike&gt;written to claim that&lt;/strike&gt;where Jesus fulfills all the Old Testament prophecies. Consequently (or perhaps the other way around), they read the Bible the way Nostradamus's fans read his works--as a book of otherwise unrelated words and phrases that can be strung together to form accurate prophecies. If you haven't read anything &lt;a href="http://slacktivist.typepad.com/"&gt;Fred Clark&lt;/a&gt; has to say about the Dispensationalist mindset, you should. They'll twist, pull, cut, and reinterpret phrases from all over the Bible to create their Rapture/Antichrist/Armageddon narrative. In arguments, this type of Christian tends to pull out the "fulfilled and to-be-fulfilled prophecy" card, citing Jesus's fulfillment of OT prophecy, prophecies in Isaiah which were said to have been fulfilled in Isaiah, and vague prophecies of the End Times, which have been coming "any day now" for at least a century (and in earlier configurations, two millennia). Things that don't fit are ignored as applying to a future 'dispensation,' whereas things that other Christians would recognize as directed at specific people are almost always talking to the current generation, no matter when that current generation exists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the general conservative fundamentalist, I'd think that the focal book might be Genesis or Exodus (insert snarky comment here about how they never got any farther), but it's far more likely that their favorite book of the Bible is actually "The Case for Christ" or "Evidence that Demands a Verdict." Their primary Gospel is John (of which they've really only read one passage). Alternately, the preferred Gospel might be Mark, since that's the one that talks about all the miracles that believers can perform (or even post-Gospel Acts, with Pentecost and speaking in tongues), but again, it depends on the fundie flavor (which I imagine is a lot like Bertie Botts' every-flavor beans, except without the good ones). These fundies more often in arguments pull out the standard cards--Pascal's Wager, "look at the trees," "your God is evolution," and so forth. I'm pretty sure that these folks are the source of bumper-sticker Christianity--their beliefs are mostly easily summed up in pithy phrases, their arguments for those beliefs are equally pithy, and their knowledge of Christian dogma comes mostly secondhand, from preachers promoting a particular interpretation. They're casual believers; they haven't put much thought into why they believe what they believe, or even the details and conclusions that follow from what they believe, but they know that they believe it, and they do so passionately. They can tell you that abortion should be illegal, but not what should happen to mothers who get illegal abortions. They can tell you that homosexuality is a sin, but aren't familiar with similar sins like shellfish-eating and wearing blended fabric. They're prepared to defend their beliefs and spread the gospel, so long as they don't have to answer any follow-up questions. Watch most &lt;a href="http://atheist-experience.com/archive/"&gt;Atheist Experience&lt;/a&gt; episodes to get a feel for this kind of Christian*.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moderate Christians tend to be the recipients of the "casual Christian" label, though they certainly aren't the only ones who deserve it. The conservative fundamentalists generally have shallow, unexamined beliefs, but they believe them fervently; the moderates have similarly shallow, unexamined beliefs, but they are fairly apathetic about it. They might go to church occasionally, or go to a moderate church, and they'll probably put up some kind of show of faith at Christmas and Easter. Their central Bible book is Psalms, or more likely, "Mere Christianity," and their favorite Gospel is split between the bits of John that they know (3:16, probably 1:1) and the bits of Luke that they know (mostly the stuff from Luke 2:10-12, or more famously, from Linus in "A Charlie Brown Christmas"). In arguments, these folks often pull the same standard cards as the conservatives, at least to start--Pascal's Wager, "look at the trees"--but usually end up going down the "well, you can't know for sure" and "what's the harm" path rather than the more threatening route of their conservative counterparts. They have their bumper stickers too, and billboards, but they're more of the simple "God is love" sort of thing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm going to pause for a moment here to draw a bit more distinction between the conservative and moderate Christians. While I think both groups seize on the same common, popular Bible verses, I think they put different emphases on them. John 3:16, for instance; I'd say that conservatives read it as &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font size="1"&gt;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, so that&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Moderates and liberals, on the other hand, I think read it as &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;For God so loved the world,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; that he gave his only begotten Son, &lt;font size="1"&gt;that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;** Incidentally, I think Catholics read it as &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font size="1"&gt;For God so loved the world,&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="4"&gt;&lt;b&gt;that he gave his only begotten Son,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font size="1"&gt;that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish,&lt;/font&gt; but have everlasting life.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Those wacky Catholics and their guilt.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The liberal Christians, as I said before, look primarily to the Sermon on the Mount as their focal point for the Bible. There's a gospel-centeredness to this, which makes it difficult (with my limited knowledge) to speculate on the gospel of choice; my guess would be John, since it's the pretty one, but it's possible that (at least among the more historically-savvy ones) it's Mark, the earliest. They look for what they see as the "core message" of the Bible, which involves as much (if not more) picking and choosing bits as the Dispensationalists, though the bits they pick and choose and twist and reinterpret, obviously, are different ones. The liberals tend to be more informed--directly or indirectly--about the thoughts of various church fathers, classic theologians, and religious philosophers. Or perhaps they're just informed about different ones; I suppose the average Dispensationalist might know as much about Scofield and Paley as the liberal knows about Weber and Augustine. Liberals generally accept the conclusions of historians and scientists, and they generally adhere to the moral codes of the modern age. They seize onto Jesus's message of love and acceptance, apply it as much as they can to the rest of the Bible, and handwave away the rest. For Dispensationalists, the stuff they disagree with applies to some other dispensation; for liberals, the stuff they disagree with was mortal flaws that made their way into the book, or matters that applied in another day and time, or just don't fit with the core message of the Bible. They tend to be less ostentatious with their faith. This is in part because they go with the flow of society, and thus aren't trying to hold back or turn back progress, so they aren't constantly waging war on modernism; in part, this is because they actually read the bit where Jesus said not to pray as the hypocrites do, but in the closets, and so they live and let live; in part, this is because they follow some variation of the Protestant ethic, in that they recognize that the best way to glorify God and to win converts is to live well and be a good example for others. I have had very few arguments with such Christians, and I've found that they're most likely to agree with you on most points; they may pull out some theological arguments that propose a Deist god (i.e., any Cosmological or Transcendental argument); they may tell you that the Fundamentalists aren't "real Christians," that they "follow Jesus, not the Bible," and that the Bible was written by people, but they're just as likely to quote G.K. Chesterton for some reason. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it's a mistake to think that any of these groups has any claim to the title "True Christian;" in fact, I'm not even sure what such a person would be. Jesus and the Biblical authors wrote so many conflicting things that it's impossible to pull any coherent philosophy of life from the book without ignoring large swaths of it, and we're only helping the fundamentalists if we don't recognize that they're ignoring just as much of the book as the liberals are. For every "it is an abomination" that the liberals ignore, there's a "judge not" that the conservatives discard. They're all "salad bar" Christians, they're just on different sides of the bar, and the Liberals are willing to say "that cottage cheese has gone bad," while the fundies will say "that cottage cheese is perfectly fine, but I'm going to let someone else try it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the problem, part of why this is so widespread (I think), is that we've gotten to the point where even the liberals and moderates seem tacitly to accept the fundamentalists' claim to the term. Perhaps it's just because the liberal position is more complicated and more difficult to communicate; when push comes to shove, the fundies can point to the passage in the Bible and say "God says it, I believe it, no more questions." At that point, the liberal has to explain that the Bible isn't meant to be taken 'literally,' or that Jesus said otherwise, or that they're ignoring the context, or something, and I think to the casual viewer, that's tantamount to them cutting off the branch they're sitting on. I can see very few good ways for a liberal Christian to easily call into doubt the Fundamentalist positions on most things without undermining their own position and making them look like wishy-washy quasi-believers. There are some matters on which the liberal position is more clearly the correct one, dogmatically and textually--once again, see the Dispensationalist End Times narrative--but it's hard to argue that the Levitican and Deuteronomian laws against homosexuality don't apply in light of one verse in Galatians and Jesus's general message of love. I think, to some degree, the liberals recognize this difficulty--and perhaps even internalize the fundamentalists' claims to some degree, causing some measure of self-doubt and insecurity--and that combines with their general non-confrontational stance regarding their faith to prevent them from speaking out against the loud fundamentalists in large numbers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which moves us on to the problem of which position is the more reasonable one. The conventional wisdom is that the liberal position has that claim, but I don't know that I agree. I imagine the people who make this claim are the people who consider themselves most rational, and so we assume that "reasonable" means "generally comes to the same conclusions we've come to." But we have to remember that reason can take you to &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; conclusion &lt;i&gt;depending on what your premises are&lt;/i&gt;. Through one method or another, both the left and right wings of Christianity have come to*** the same basic premise: the God of the Bible exists, came to the Earth as Jesus Christ, then died on the cross for the sins of humanity, and promises Heaven for some and Hell for others****. Following from this premise, though, they end up at wildly different courses of action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The right-leaning Christians take this premise, realize that the Bible is their only source for what God thinks, what Jesus said, and what the secret password into Heaven is, and conclude that they ought to be following what's in the Bible as closely as they can in order to avoid Hell. There are a number of different logical avenues which can lead from this point to the belief that the Bible is a true, accurate, and perfect representation of what God wants, but I think it boils down to the point that, since it's the only source for what God says, they have to &lt;i&gt;treat&lt;/i&gt; it as perfect even if it isn't. Christians of this sort will sometimes admit (usually when condemning Christians of the more liberal variety) that if you treat any part of the Bible as metaphorical or symbolic or otherwise not-true, then you might as well toss out the whole thing: either it's all true, or none of it is true. This is a fallacy, to be sure, but underlying it is a valid concern and criticism for their liberal brethren: if it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; all true, then how do you know what parts of it &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; true? The fundamentalist (ostensibly) never needs to face this quandary, since they (ostensibly) accept all of the Bible as "literally" true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their other traits follow from that conclusion. Knowing the threat of Hell, they work tirelessly to convince others that Hell is real and that they know how to avoid it. They've been saved from its fiery jaws, and they're going to try to make sure that everyone else gets saved too (and the ones they can't save--the ones working against them--are already in its grip and beyond their help). They dedicate as much of their lives as they can to praising and glorifying God with all the energy and volume of a castaway trying to signal a passing cargo plane, as though trying to draw the attention of the omnipotent and earn his approval. They've saturated their lives with worship and work to wedge it into everyone else's lives, through sermons and tracts and street-corner preaching and legislation and education and media punditry and social mores and any other outlet they can find, in hopes that doing so will demonstrate their devotion, glorify their deity, increase their numbers, and protect them from annihilation and damnation should God decide that America looks an awful lot like Gomorrah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, you have the liberal and moderate Christians. Again, they've arrived at the same basic premises as the conservatives with regard to God's nature and existence, and the importance of Jesus. There's a chicken-and-egg situation with the next bit, though, where I'm not sure what precedes what. Moderate and liberal Christians have somehow come to a largely different set of premises in addition to the ones they share with the fundies, the sort of premises that I imagine we'd consider average for people in the 21st century western world: they value freedom and equality, they think science and senses are generally reliable, they generally accept the morals of the society around them, and so forth. They also have a different take on the Bible; though it's the only primary source that discusses (with any authority) the mind of God and the story of Jesus, they think that it's only somewhat reliable and accurate--certainly not the icon of perfection that the fundamentalists elevate it to. They read the Bible for its 'core message' and justify or ignore the parts that don't fit. In addition to the Bible, such Christians tend to accept another source for their beliefs: alternately called "faith" or "a personal relationship with God/Christ," who typically speaks to them "in their heart." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like I said, there's a chicken/egg issue here: did the belief in the God relationship come first, allowing them to decide what parts of the Bible no longer apply and what God's real opinions are, or did the acceptance of modern morals and science and such lead to the belief that such conclusions were the result of a personal connection to the divine? I can't say, though I suspect it's not a simple causal relationship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, this connection to God makes each liberal Christian his or her own Pope, able to update the canon and dogma as necessary, on a personal level. Each claims that their pronouncements have some divine weight behind them, though they may come to different conclusions, but that's certainly not a problem faced by liberals alone. They are able, through their relationship with God, to determine what the "core message" of the Bible is, what that means for the other parts, and what God's message for the modern age must be. God, apparently, is pretty cool with the trappings of modern society that the fundamentalists reject; he thinks that believers shouldn't be ostentatious about their faith, he sees virtuous living and skillful craftsmanship in his followers' vocations as glorification of him, and he might even accept other routes to Heaven than through Jesus. He puts some emphasis on works as a key to salvation, loves his creations, and encourages them above all things to love one another. Consequently, they generally adopt a live-and-let-live philosophy toward people of other faiths, rather than the obvious and constant proselytization of the conservatives. They don't see the need to enact their beliefs into law, since religion is a personal thing, to be done in the closets and not out in the open as the hypocrites. God said "love thy neighbor," not "force thy neighbor to act in accordance with thy beliefs." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, back to the main point of all this: who's more reasonable? While the liberal position is the one most in line with what modern society would consider reasonable, I'm not sure how well it logically follows from their beliefs. It's easy to see the logical progression of fundamentalism; if you believed in the sort of God that they do, you'd want to make sure that no one--particularly yourself--got on his bad side. The liberals have a more difficult progression, and I think it's here that some of the fundamentalist criticisms hold water. The Bible is, for better or worse, the closest thing we have to a primary source on the life and teachings of Jesus. It is also the only generally-agreed-upon testimony of the morals, acts, and commandments of the Christian God. And yet, the liberals actively dismiss parts of it as metaphor or parable or mistake or outdated teaching, in favor of impressions and feelings they get internally, which they believe to be divine. This poses a problem: do they assert that the fundamentalists, conservatives, and others who come to different conclusions &lt;i&gt;lack&lt;/i&gt; a personal rapport with the divine? By what right and authority can they make such a distinction? Wouldn't such an argument boil down to diametrically-opposed shouts of "God told me I'm right"? Or do they recognize the legitimacy of the conservatives' claim to personal relationships with God, but acknowledge that he's telling them different things? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, how do the liberals know that their relationship is with God at all? The fundamentalists are likely to say that any voice speaking in their hearts things that contradict the Bible must be the trickery of Satan; how do the liberals know that this voice which tells them things they want to hear but conflict with the Bible is the voice of the divine and not the damned? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those would be the criticisms from the fundamentalists, and I'm not entirely sure how the liberal Christian would respond to them, except to cite again the "core message" of the Bible. I don't think that would convince the fundamentalists; their approaches to the Bible are vastly different, and any response about the "core message" is going to fall well outside of the fundamentalists' framework. But I have another criticism, one which others (both atheists and theists) have leveled: if you have a personal relationship with God through which he shares his teachings and prescriptions, and if much of the Bible is flawed and outdated, then &lt;i&gt;why do you need the Bible at all&lt;/i&gt;? Having God give you the straight scoop on his up-to-the-minute revised revelations makes the Bible an outdated edition, several generations removed from what's currently available, and not even particularly useful for the end-of-chapter questions. Why would liberal Christians assign any significance to the Bible at all? Sentimentality? Why justify any part of it? Why use it as an authoritative reference? If you're acknowledging that it was written and assembled and translated by flawed people, and if you're asserting that your personal revelation trumps theirs, then why even consult it? Or at the very least, why give it any more prominence than the writings of the similarly-inspired theologians, poets, and other writers who inform your faith? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, to unite this with the fundamentalist critique: if you don't believe all of the Bible, why believe any of it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, lest we think that the fundamentalists have the monopoly on criticism here, their devotion to the Bible opens them up to a criticism from the liberals. The liberals accept the history of the Bible, the sordid tales of copyists and committees, of discarded books and dogmas past that are attested to by all the available evidence (not that that would be convincing for some). They accept--even assert--that the book is not perfect, that it was transcribed, copied, and translated by imperfect humans who may have even been imperfectly interpreting their divine inspiration. I think the liberal, in general, would be likely to say that no human's interpretation of the divine is perfect, that no human work is perfect, and that their own apprehension of both divine and mundane may be imperfect. They'd be likely, I think, to say that only God is perfect, and that elevating the Bible (or anything else of this mortal world) to the status of perfection is idolatry. Were they particularly savvy, they might point out that even if the Bible were perfect, the people reading and interpreting it are not, and thus the fundamentalist is not merely asserting the Bible's perfection, but their own as well. They are engaging in self-idolatry, declaring themselves perfectly able to sort out the will and mind of God from the imperfect writings of first-century preachers. I'm not sure, but I don't think most liberal Christians pretend to the kind of certainty approaching personal infallibility that the fundamentalists so often do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And you'd think that the fundies would be all over this, what with their general acceptance (and promotion) of the idea that this Earth is fallen, tainted, imperfect, and potentially even ruled by Satan. Why is the Bible excepted from this assessment? Accepting its history should fit perfectly into their worldview. Instead, not only will they deny it, defend its unity, and proclaim its perfection, but in many cases they'll claim that one particular arbitrary version is the only perfect one, above all others. They accomplish this through an amazing display of compartmentalization, denial, and Olympic-level quality gymnastics, when they'd only have to apply their worldview consistently to make the whole mess fit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I think there are significant failures of reason on both sides, some more fundamental than others. Inasmuch as the beliefs and practices follow logically from the premises, I think the edge might indeed go to the conservatives, though I think both sides have some pretty distinct fallacies to deal with. Both, as far as I'm concerned, are dealing with unsound premises--and I think the unsound premises of the conservative position are far more fundamental--and the other problems spiral out of that. Either way, I know which group I'd rather associate with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I recognize that all of this is a mishmash of speculation, subjective experience, armchair psychology, barely-informed theology, and broad generalizing, but I think there may be something to all this. I won't say that these categories are entirely distinct, accurately named, or all-inclusive. I'm drawing very vague lines here, between very large and overlapping categories, and if I'm making some obvious errors, feel free to correct me. But what I've tried to accomplish with this overlong screed is a fairly fine and simple response to the two common claims I mentioned above. To say that either the liberals or conservatives has a more legitimate claim to the term "True Christian" is problematic at best, and tends to fallaciously favor the fundamentalists. To say that either conservative or liberal Christianity is more "reasonable" entirely depends on whether you mean "reasonable" in a casual sense of "not crazy," or "reasonable" in the more specific and accurate sense of "well-reasoned." In that case, it really relies upon counting the fallacies leading from unsound premises to invalid conclusions, and I'd have to see a side-by-side array of the different specific arguments, with premises and conclusions laid out specifically, in order to make such a distinction (though my inclination is that the conservative position may follow more directly from the flawed premises). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, neither claim is accurate, and we (atheists and moderate/liberal theists alike) should consider being more careful with the assumptions we make and the assumptions our language betrays with regard to who are the real and reasonable Christians. To do less risks granting prestige and legitimacy to those who haven't earned it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;br&gt;*I think the modern conservative Christians have a lot in common with the medieval Catholic laity and the 17th Century Protestant laity. In all three cases, the vast majority have read little, if any, of the Bible; the old Catholics weren't allowed to, the early Protestants were largely illiterate, and the modern group is a little of both, with apathy, short attention span, and arrogant ignorance mixed in. Like those early protestants, the modern conservatives get their beliefs mostly from popular reinterpretations--four hundred years ago, if a family owned two books, they were the Bible and "Pilgrim's Progress," which uses tortuously obvious metaphor to turn the Christian experience into a narrative. Today, I suspect that "Evidence that Demands a Verdict," "The Case for Christ," "Mere Christianity," and "Left Behind" (among other books) have supplanted Bunyan in most conservative Christians' homes. Like those lay Catholics of the middle ages, conservative Christians tend to often look to God and the trappings of Christianity as a source of magic. This theme comes up repeatedly in Fred Clark's analysis of "Left Behind," particularly toward the end. Where the medieval laity would steal communion wafers and use corrupted versions of Latin phrases to try to conduct more-or-less Pagan magic rituals, the modern conservative seems to view prayer as something akin to calling upon a finicky genie, and being saved binds God to the believer, forming a magical shield which protects them against Chaotic Evil. As long as you say the right magic words, God will reveal himself to you and protect you, but only if you do it right (see also: the Sinner's Prayer). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if the conservatives are modern-day Catholic or Protestant laity, then the Dispensationalists are modern-day Gnostics. I wrote a historically and theologically inept paper to that end in undergrad, but that thesis only becomes more and more apparent as I look into the blatant exclusivist Manicheanism practiced by the likes of Tim LaHaye. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**It's even more nuanced than this, I think--Dispensationalists and other End-Timers, with their fixation on the Rapture as an (otherwise indistinguishable) alternative to death, would put even more emphasis on the "shall not perish," while the other conservatives (with similar fears but different fixations) would emphasize the "have everlasting life." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***I say "come to" because these beliefs aren't (necessarily) axiomatic. Some Christians of either bent may consider the premise that God exists and loves us to be foundational, axiomatic, transcendent, or something along those lines, but they still initially arrived at that premise through some other method--being told by parents, being convinced by arguments, etc. That method of first convincing had to follow some other path of reasoning, relying on other axioms--Mommy is always right, if a belief is comforting then I should believe it, if an argument is convincing then it must be true, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;****Of course, there are Christians with different takes on this--non-Trinitarians, universal salvationists, folks who deny that Hell is a real place, and so forth. I'm drawing broad generalizations again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/20494433-2746964205367465536?l=dubitoergo.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Tom Foss</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Dubito Ergo Sum</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236746841907"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/back_from_boston.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/477a7b78a697dd20</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Back from Boston</title><published>2009-03-11T05:13:06Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T05:13:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/8uyf1vgclTw/back_from_boston.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/back_from_boston.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still recovering. Flights were smooth. I finally finished Jennifer Rohn's book on the airplane. I hated my Chapel Hill neighbors, lounging at the pool in 78F, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/yikes_-_we_just_got_rid_of_the.php" title=""&gt;I was leaving for the cold&lt;/a&gt;, snowy Boston. But now I'm back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/in_boston_are_you.php" title=""&gt;first night&lt;/a&gt;, a bunch of us went to the &lt;a href="http://www.sciencecafes.org/event_pages/Boston1.html" title=""&gt;Science Cafe&lt;/a&gt; and discussed the possibility of intelligent life in the Universe and methods to find them if they are out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boston09 001.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Boston09%20001.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And had some dinner as well...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boston09 002.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Boston09%20002.jpg" width="336" height="448"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/next_week_in_boston.php" title=""&gt;On Monday&lt;/a&gt;, we gathered at &lt;a href="http://www.wgbh.org/" title=""&gt;WGBH&lt;/a&gt; station, in a nice, modern, green building, and about 20 of us discussed the PRI/BBC/NOVA/SigmaXi/WGBH/World project: how to build an online Science Cafe that is tied to their expanding science coverage on the radio show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boston09 007.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Boston09%20007.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room was full of brilliant people, each coming from a different background and having different experiences, expertise and ideas. There were key people from each of the above-mentioned organizations, including my friends here from Sigma Xi &lt;a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/about/" title=""&gt;Katie Lord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://elsakristen.com/" title=""&gt;Elsa Youngsteadt&lt;/a&gt;, plus &lt;a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~terveen/" title=""&gt;Loren Terveen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rmurthy.com/" title=""&gt;Rekha Murthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bryankeefer.com/" title=""&gt;Bryan Keefer&lt;/a&gt; and myself as 'external advisors'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boston09 008.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Boston09%20008.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent about seven hours brainstorming how to make this happen, what to do, what NOT to do, what to expect, how to go about it. Not more I can tell you right now - I'll keep you in the loop as these things get under way and become public - but I am quite excited about the project myself, I have to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boston09 009.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Boston09%20009.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to finish the meeting just in time to catch the last few minutes of the live broadcast of &lt;a href="http://www.theworld.org/" title=""&gt;The World&lt;/a&gt;, which we observed from within the studio (we had to keep very quiet!). The World has been making podcasts for quite a while, but just recently started doing &lt;a href="http://www.theworld.org/rss/science.xml" title=""&gt;science podcasts&lt;/a&gt; - four so far: check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boston09 010.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/Boston09%20010.jpg" width="448" height="336"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went to &lt;a href="http://www.casablanca-restaurant.com/" title=""&gt;Casablanca&lt;/a&gt; for some food and beer with friends: &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/U2929A0EA/blog" title=""&gt;Anna Kushnir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://network.nature.com/people/chenette/profile" title=""&gt;Emily Chenette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/scitable" title=""&gt;Rachel Davis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.openhelix.com/blog/" title=""&gt;Mary Mangan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://elsakristen.com/" title=""&gt;Elsa Youngsteadt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/" title=""&gt;Blake Stacey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://daedalus2u.blogspot.com/" title=""&gt;David Whitlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.roarproject.org/ROAR/html/staff.htm" title=""&gt;Michael Feldgarden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sph.bu.edu/index.php?option=com_sphdir&amp;amp;id=239&amp;amp;Itemid=340&amp;amp;INDEX=653" title=""&gt;David Ozonoff  &lt;/a&gt;. I love meeting friends, old and new, wherever I travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court today, Judge James Ellis of San Mateo County Superior Court called Adams’ actions “despicable” and said he regretted that the maximum sentence wasn’t longer, said Steve Wagstaffe, chief deputy district attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m with Judge Ellis. Sure I’m opposed to capital punishment but would it be wrong to mail her to Abu Dhabi or Afghanistan?&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll have more, including an updated launch time, later.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things, of opposite natures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Debris from the smashed Cosmos satellite is predicted to start re-entering Earth’s atmosphere as early as Thursday according to &lt;a href="http://spaceweather.com/"&gt;spaceweather.com&lt;/a&gt;. That’s earlier than I expected, but not by much; I figured it would be a few weeks. Basically, debris that had orbits that dipped lower would get more drag from the Earth’s very thin atmosphere at that height, and over time their orbit drops. As they drop, the air gets thicker, dropping them more, until… &lt;em&gt;fzzzt!&lt;/em&gt; Evidently, for reasons unknown (I suspect collision geometry and the construction of the satellite itself — it may have been internally pressurized) the debris cloud from the Cosmos satellite expanded more than from the Iridium bird, so it’s coming in sooner.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The Space Shuttle is due to launch at 21:20 Eastern (US) time Wednesday night (01:20 UT Thursday morning). It’ll be covered on &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ntv"&gt;NASA TV&lt;/a&gt; of course, and I expect &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/badastronomer"&gt;I’ll live tweet it&lt;/a&gt;. Damaris Sarria, an astronaut candidate, &lt;a href="http://damarisbsarria.blogspot.com/2009/03/look-for-me-on-spaceflightnowcom.html"&gt;will be on various venues discussing it as well&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since I know you’re wondering… according to NASA, the debris poses a very small risk to the Shuttle over the usual background field of junk up there. Hopefully everything will go smoothly and safely.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236744992755"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/gender_trends_in_science_and_m.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20bc5762904bc637</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Reporting"/><title type="html">Gender Trends in Science and Medical Writing</title><published>2009-03-11T04:33:28Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T04:33:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/cn2BHSIaIIA/gender_trends_in_science_and_m.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/gender_trends_in_science_and_m.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Karen Ventii, a former SciBling and now a science writer, &lt;a href="http://quichemoraine.com/2009/03/gender-trends-in-science-and-medical-writing/" title=""&gt;wonders&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a medical writer, I've noticed that most medical writers I meet are female. A quick Google search using the keywords‚ "freelance medical writer‚" produced seven female and three male writers (approx. 2:1 ratio) from the first 10 eligible results.1 While it is difficult to draw statistically relevant conclusions from such a small sample size, it certainly implies a trend.

&lt;p&gt;The American Medical Writers Association is the leading professional organization for medical communicators, with over 5,500 members from around the world. The ratio of female to male members is 4449:1227 (approx. 4:1), mirroring the trend observed with the Google search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004803" title=""&gt;Clickstream Data Yields High-Resolution Maps of Science&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intricate maps of science have been created from citation data to visualize the structure of scientific activity. However, most scientific publications are now accessed online. Scholarly web portals record detailed log data at a scale that exceeds the number of all existing citations combined. Such log data is recorded immediately upon publication and keeps track of the sequences of user requests (clickstreams) that are issued by a variety of users across many different domains. Given these advantages of log datasets over citation data, we investigate whether they can produce high-resolution, more current maps of science. Over the course of 2007 and 2008, we collected nearly 1 billion user interactions recorded by the scholarly web portals of some of the most significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia. The resulting reference data set covers a significant part of world-wide use of scholarly web portals in 2006, and provides a balanced coverage of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. A journal clickstream model, i.e. a first-order Markov chain, was extracted from the sequences of user interactions in the logs. The clickstream model was validated by comparing it to the Getty Research Institute's Architecture and Art Thesaurus. The resulting model was visualized as a journal network that outlines the relationships between various scientific domains and clarifies the connection of the social sciences and humanities to the natural sciences. Maps of science resulting from large-scale clickstream data provide a detailed, contemporary view of scientific activity and correct the underrepresentation of the social sciences and humanities that is commonly found in citation data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004838" title=""&gt;Mystery Solved: The Identification of the Two Missing Romanov Children Using DNA Analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the greatest mysteries for most of the twentieth century was the fate of the Romanov family, the last Russian monarchy. Following the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, he and his wife, Alexandra, and their five children were eventually exiled to the city of Yekaterinburg. The family, along with four loyal members of their staff, was held captive by members of the Ural Soviet. According to historical reports, in the early morning hours of July 17, 1918 the entire family along with four loyal members of their staff was executed by a firing squad. After a failed attempt to dispose of the remains in an abandoned mine shaft, the bodies were transported to an open field only a few kilometers from the mine shaft. Nine members of the group were buried in one mass grave while two of the children were buried in a separate grave. With the official discovery of the larger mass grave in 1991, and subsequent DNA testing to confirm the identities of the Tsar, the Tsarina, and three of their daughters - doubt persisted that these remains were in fact those of the Romanov family. In the summer of 2007, a group of amateur archeologists discovered a collection of remains from the second grave approximately 70 meters from the larger grave. We report forensic DNA testing on the remains discovered in 2007 using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), autosomal STR, and Y- STR testing. Combined with additional DNA testing of material from the 1991 grave, we have virtually irrefutable evidence that the two individuals recovered from the 2007 grave are the two missing children of the Romanov family: the Tsarevich Alexei and one of his sisters.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004791" title=""&gt;Universality of Rank-Ordering Distributions in the Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Searching for generic behaviors has been one of the driving forces leading to a deep understanding and classification of diverse phenomena. Usually a starting point is the development of a phenomenology based on observations. Such is the case for power law distributions encountered in a wealth of situations coming from physics, geophysics, biology, lexicography as well as social and financial networks. This finding is however restricted to a range of values outside of which finite size corrections are often invoked. Here we uncover a universal behavior of the way in which elements of a system are distributed according to their rank with respect to a given property, valid for the full range of values, regardless of whether or not a power law has previously been suggested. We propose a two parameter functional form for these rank-ordered distributions that gives excellent fits to an impressive amount of very diverse phenomena, coming from the arts, social and natural sciences. It is a discrete version of a generalized beta distribution, given by f(r) = A(N+1-r)b/ra, where r is the rank, N its maximum value, A the normalization constant and (a, b) two fitting exponents. Prompted by our genetic sequence observations we present a growth probabilistic model incorporating mutation-duplication features that generates data complying with this distribution. The competition between permanence and change appears to be a relevant, though not necessary feature. Additionally, our observations mainly of social phenomena suggest that a multifactorial quality resulting from the convergence of several heterogeneous underlying processes is an important feature. We also explore the significance of the distribution parameters and their classifying potential. The ubiquity of our findings suggests that there must be a fundamental underlying explanation, most probably of a statistical nature, such as an appropriate central limit theorem formulation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004785" title=""&gt;The Architecture of the Golfer's Brain&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Several recent studies have shown practice-dependent structural alterations in humans. Cross-sectional studies of intensive practice of specific tasks suggest associated long-term structural adaptations. Playing golf at a high level of performance is one of the most demanding sporting activities. In this study, we report the relationship between a particular level of proficiency in playing golf (indicated by golf handicap level) and specific neuroanatomical features. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of grey (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes and fractional anisotropy (FA) measures of the fibre tracts, we identified differences between skilled (professional golfers and golfers with an handicap from 1-14) and less-skilled golfers (golfers with an handicap from 15-36 and non-golfer). Larger GM volumes were found in skilled golfers in a fronto-parietal network including premotor and parietal areas. Skilled golfers revealed smaller WM volume and FA values in the vicinity of the corticospinal tract at the level of the internal and external capsule and in the parietal operculum. However, there was no structural difference within the skilled and less-skilled golfer group. There is no linear relationship between the anatomical findings and handicap level, amount of practice, and practice hours per year. There was however a strong difference between highly-practiced golfers (at least 800-3,000 hours) and those who have practised less or non-golfers without any golfing practise, thus indicating a step-wise structural and not a linear change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004741" title=""&gt;Reality = Relevance? Insights from Spontaneous Modulations of the Brain's Default Network when Telling Apart Reality from Fiction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although human beings regularly experience fictional worlds through activities such as reading novels and watching movies, little is known about what mechanisms underlie our implicit knowledge of the distinction between reality and fiction. The first neuroimaging study to address this issue revealed that the mere exposure to contexts involving real entities compared to fictional characters led to engagement of regions in the anterior medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices (amPFC, PCC). As these core regions of the brain's default network are involved during self-referential processing and autobiographical memory retrieval, it was hypothesized that real entities may be conceptually coded as being more personally relevant to us than fictional characters. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we directly test the hypothesis that entity-associated personal relevance is the critical factor underlying the differential engagement of these brain regions by comparing the brain's response when processing contexts involving family or friends (high relevance), famous people (medium relevance), or fictional characters (low relevance). In line with predictions, a gradient pattern of activation was observed such that higher entity-associated personal relevance was associated with stronger activation in the amPFC and the PCC. The results of the study have several important implications. Firstly, they provide informed grounds for characterizing the dynamics of reality-fiction distinction. Secondly, they provide further insights into the functions of the amPFC and the PCC. Thirdly, in view of the current debate related to the functional relevance and specificity of brain's default network, they reveal a novel approach by which the functions of this network can be further explored.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004703" title=""&gt;Desiccation of Rock Pool Habitats and Its Influence on Population Persistence in a Daphnia Metacommunity&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Habitat instability has an important influence on species' occurrence and community composition. For freshwater arthropods that occur in ephemeral rock pools, the most drastic habitat instabilities are droughts and the intermittent availability of water. However, although the desiccation of a rock pool is detrimental for planktonic populations, it may also bring certain benefits: the exclusion of predators or parasites, for example, or the coexistence of otherwise competitively exclusive species. The commonness of drought resistant resting stages in many aquatic organisms shows the ecological significance of droughts. We measured daily evaporation in 50 rock pools inhabited by three Daphnia species D. magna, D. longispina and D. pulex over one summer. Daily evaporation and ultimately desiccation showed significantly seasonally influenced correlation with pool surface area, presence of vegetation, ambient temperature, wind and standardized evaporation measures. We used the estimates from this analysis to develop a simulation model to predict changes in the water level in 530 individual pools on a daily basis over a 25-year period. Eventually, hydroperiod lengths and desiccation events could be predicted for all of these rock pools. We independently confirmed the validity of this simulation by surveying desiccation events in the 530 rock pools over a whole season in 2006. In the same 530 rock pools, Daphnia communities had been recorded over the 25 years the simulation model considered. We correlated pool-specific occupation lengths of the three species with pool-specific measures of desiccation risk. Occupation lengths of all three Daphnia species were positively correlated with maximum hydroperiod length and negatively correlated with the number of desiccation events. Surprisingly, these effects were not species-specific.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004768" title=""&gt;Free-Ranging Macaque Mothers Exaggerate Tool-Using Behavior when Observed by Offspring&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The population-level use of tools has been reported in various animals. Nonetheless, how tool use might spread throughout a population is still an open question. In order to answer that, we observed the behavior of inserting human hair or human-hair-like material between their teeth as if they were using dental floss in a group of long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in Thailand. The observation was undertaken by video-recording the tool-use of 7 adult females who were rearing 1-year-old infants, using the focal-animal-sampling method. When the data recorded were analyzed separately according to the presence/absence of the infant of the target animal in the target animal's proximity, the pattern of the tool-using action of long-tailed adult female macaques under our observation changed in the presence of the infant as compared with that in the absence of the infant so that the stream of tool-using action was punctuated by more pauses, repeated more often, and performed for a longer period during each bout in the presence of the infant. We interpret this as evidence for the possibility that they exaggerate their action in tool-using so as to facilitate the learning of the action by their own infants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004786" title=""&gt;Use of Number by Fish&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Research on human infants, mammals, birds and fish has demonstrated that rudimentary numerical abilities pre-date the evolution of human language. Yet there is controversy as to whether animals represent numbers mentally or rather base their judgments on non-numerical perceptual variables that co-vary with numerosity. To date, mental representation of number has been convincingly documented only for a few mammals. Here we used a training procedure to investigate whether mosquitofish could learn to discriminate between two and three objects even when denied access to non-numerical information. In the first experiment, fish were trained to discriminate between two sets of geometric figures. These varied in shape, size, brightness and distance, but no control for non-numerical variables was made. Subjects were then re-tested while controlling for one non-numerical variable at a time. Total luminance of the stimuli and the sum of perimeter of figures appeared irrelevant, but performance dropped to chance level when stimuli were matched for the cumulative surface area or for the overall space occupied by the arrays, indicating that these latter cues had been spontaneously used by the fish during the learning process. In a second experiment, where the task consisted of discriminating 2 vs 3 elements with all non-numerical variables simultaneously controlled for, all subjects proved able to learn the discrimination, and interestingly they did not make more errors than the fish in Experiment 1 that could access non-numerical information in order to accomplish the task. Mosquitofish can learn to discriminate small quantities, even when non-numerical indicators of quantity are unavailable, hence providing the first evidence that fish, like primates, can use numbers. As in humans and non-human primates, genuine counting appears to be a 'last resort' strategy in fish, when no other perceptual mechanism may suggest the quantity of the elements. However, our data suggest that, at least in fish, the priority of perceptual over numerical information is not related to a greater cognitive load imposed by direct numerical computation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004796" title=""&gt;Self-Medication as Adaptive Plasticity: Increased Ingestion of Plant Toxins by Parasitized Caterpillars&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Self-medication is a specific therapeutic behavioral change in response to disease or parasitism. The empirical literature on self-medication has so far focused entirely on identifying cases of self-medication in which particular behaviors are linked to therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we frame self-medication in the broader realm of adaptive plasticity, which provides several testable predictions for verifying self-medication and advancing its conceptual significance. First, self-medication behavior should improve the fitness of animals infected by parasites or pathogens. Second, self-medication behavior in the absence of infection should decrease fitness. Third, infection should induce self-medication behavior. The few rigorous studies of self-medication in non-human animals have not used this theoretical framework and thus have not tested fitness costs of self-medication in the absence of disease or parasitism. Here we use manipulative experiments to test these predictions with the foraging behavior of woolly bear caterpillars (Grammia incorrupta; Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) in response to their lethal endoparasites (tachinid flies). Our experiments show that the ingestion of plant toxins called pyrrolizidine alkaloids improves the survival of parasitized caterpillars by conferring resistance against tachinid flies. Consistent with theoretical prediction, excessive ingestion of these toxins reduces the survival of unparasitized caterpillars. Parasitized caterpillars are more likely than unparasitized caterpillars to specifically ingest large amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids. This case challenges the conventional view that self-medication behavior is restricted to animals with advanced cognitive abilities, such as primates, and empowers the science of self-medication by placing it in the domain of adaptive plasticity theory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004740" title=""&gt;Morphological Diversity and the Roles of Contingency, Chance and Determinism in African Cichlid Radiations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Deterministic evolution, phylogenetic contingency and evolutionary chance each can influence patterns of morphological diversification during adaptive radiation. In comparative studies of replicate radiations, convergence in a common morphospace implicates determinism, whereas non-convergence suggests the importance of contingency or chance. The endemic cichlid fish assemblages of the three African great lakes have evolved similar sets of ecomorphs but show evidence of non-convergence when compared in a common morphospace, suggesting the importance of contingency and/or chance. We then analyzed the morphological diversity of each assemblage independently and compared their axes of diversification in the unconstrained global morphospace. We find that despite differences in phylogenetic composition, invasion history, and ecological setting, the three assemblages are diversifying along parallel axes through morphospace and have nearly identical variance-covariance structures among morphological elements. By demonstrating that replicate adaptive radiations are diverging along parallel axes, we have shown that non-convergence in the common morphospace is associated with convergence in the global morphospace. Applying these complimentary analyses to future comparative studies will improve our understanding of the relationship between morphological convergence and non-convergence, and the roles of contingency, chance and determinism in driving morphological diversification.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004745" title=""&gt;Physically Active Lifestyle Does Not Decrease the Risk of Fattening&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Increasing age is associated with declining physical activity and a gain in fat mass. The objective was to observe the consequence of the age-associated reduction in physical activity for the maintenance of energy balance as reflected in the fat store of the body. Young adults were observed over an average time interval of more than 10 years. Physical activity was measured over two-week periods with doubly labeled water and doubly labeled water validated triaxial accelerometers, and body fat gain was measured with isotope dilution. There was a significant association between the change in physical activity and the change in body fat, where a high initial activity level was predictive for a higher fat gain. The change from a physically active to a more sedentary routine does not induce an equivalent reduction of energy intake and requires cognitive restriction to maintain energy balance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004744" title=""&gt;Feline Leukemia Virus and Other Pathogens as Important Threats to the Survival of the Critically Endangered Iberian Lynx (Lynx pardinus)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is considered the most endangered felid species in the world. In order to save this species, the Spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild. In this context, a retrospective survey on prevalence of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated. We systematically analyzed the prevalence and importance of seven viral, one protozoan (Cytauxzoon felis), and several bacterial (e.g., hemotropic mycoplasma) infections in 77 of approximately 200 remaining free-ranging Iberian lynxes of the Doñana and Sierra Morena areas, in Southern Spain, between 2003 and 2007. With the exception of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), evidence of infection by all tested feline pathogens was found in Iberian lynxes. Fourteen lynxes were feline leukemia virus (FeLV) provirus-positive; eleven of these were antigenemic (FeLV p27 positive). All 14 animals tested negative for other viral infections. During a six-month period in 2007, six of the provirus-positive antigenemic lynxes died. Infection with FeLV but not with other infectious agents was associated with mortality (p&amp;lt;0.001). Sequencing of the FeLV surface glycoprotein gene revealed a common origin for ten of the eleven samples. The ten sequences were closely related to FeLV-A/61E, originally isolated from cats in the USA. Endogenous FeLV sequences were not detected. It was concluded that the FeLV infection most likely originated from domestic cats invading the lynx&amp;#39;s habitats. Data available regarding the time frame, co-infections, and outcome of FeLV-infections suggest that, in contrast to the domestic cat, the FeLV strain affecting the lynxes in 2007 is highly virulent to this species. Our data argue strongly for vaccination of lynxes and domestic cats in and around lynx&amp;#39;s habitats in order to prevent further spread of the virus as well as reduction the domestic cat population if the lynx population is to be maintained.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004798" title=""&gt;A Large Scale shRNA Barcode Screen Identifies the Circadian Clock Component ARNTL as Putative Regulator of the p53 Tumor Suppressor Pathway&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The p53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in about half of human cancers, but the p53 pathway is thought to be functionally inactivated in the vast majority of cancer. Understanding how tumor cells can become insensitive to p53 activation is therefore of major importance. Using an RNAi-based genetic screen, we have identified three novel genes that regulate p53 function. We have screened the NKI shRNA library targeting 8,000 human genes to identify modulators of p53 function. Using the shRNA barcode technique we were able to quickly identify active shRNA vectors from a complex mixture. Validation of the screening results indicates that the shRNA barcode technique can reliable identify active shRNA vectors from a complex pool. Using this approach we have identified three genes, ARNTL, RBCK1 and TNIP1, previously unknown to regulate p53 function. Importantly, ARNTL (BMAL1) is an established component of the circadian regulatory network. The latter finding adds to recent observations that link circadian rhythm to the cell cycle and cancer. We show that cells having suppressed ARNTL are unable to arrest upon p53 activation associated with an inability to activate the p53 target gene p21CIP1. We identified three new regulators of the p53 pathway through a functional genetic screen. The identification of the circadian core component ARNTL strengthens the link between circadian rhythm and cancer.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/new_and_exciting_in_plos_one_132.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/FMgvX9DS2V0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236744992754"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/today_in_plos_biology.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/855effd3117c2cc7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science News"/><title type="html">Today in PLoS Biology</title><published>2009-03-11T01:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T01:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/sh9adDvKEo0/today_in_plos_biology.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/today_in_plos_biology.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Could not resist....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The circadian clock is the biological clock found throughout the body that coordinates the timing of molecular and cellular processes on a 24-hour rhythm. It is composed of numerous transcription factors that feed back and control their own expression. To explore how the clock functions in the face of genetic perturbations, we disrupted its function by knocking down gene expression of known clock genes in a dose-dependent fashion. We measured the expression of clock genes following knockdown and constructed perturbation-based network models to describe, visualize, and mine the results. We reported several novel network features, such as signal propagation through interacting genetic modules and proportional responses whereby levels of expression are altered commensurately with changing levels of the gene. We also observed several examples where a gene is up-regulated following knockdown of its paralog, suggesting the clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. We propose that the network features we observe act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000056" title=""&gt;Amazonian Amphibian Diversity Is Primarily Derived from Late Miocene Andean Lineages&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Neotropics, which includes South and Central America, contains half of remaining rainforests and the largest reservoir of amphibian diversity. Why there are so many species in certain areas and how such diversity arose before the Quaternary (i.e., more that 1.8 million years ago [MYA]) are largely unstudied. One hypothesis is that the Amazon Basin was the key source of diversity, and species dispersed from there to other areas. Here, we reconstruct a time-calibrated phylogeny and track, in space and time, the distribution of the endemic and species-rich clade of poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) during the Cenozoic (more than 65 MYA) across the continental Neotropics. Our results indicate a far more complex pattern of lineage dispersals and radiations during the past 10 MY. Rather than the Amazon Basin being the center of origin, our results show that the diversity stemmed from repeated dispersals from adjacent areas, especially from the Andes. We also found a recurrent pattern of colonization of Central America from the Chocó at 4-5 MY earlier than the formation of the Panamanian Land Bridge at 1.5 MYA. Thus, the major patterns of dispersals and radiations in the Neotropics were already set by ∼5-6 MYA (the Miocene-Pliocene boundary), but the ongoing process of Neotropical radiation is still happening now, especially in the Chocó-Central America region and Amazonian rainforest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000053" title=""&gt;Transmission Dynamics and Prospects for the Elimination of Canine Rabies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Canine rabies has been successfully eliminated from Western Europe and North America, but in the developing world, someone dies every ten minutes from this horrific disease, which is primarily spread by domestic dogs. A quantitative understanding of rabies transmission dynamics in domestic dog populations is crucial to determining whether global elimination can be achieved. The unique pathology of rabies allowed us to trace case-to-case transmission directly, during a rabies outbreak in northern Tanzania. From these unusual data, we generated a detailed analysis of rabies transmission biology and found evidence for surprisingly low levels of transmission. We also analysed outbreak data from around the world and found that the transmission of canine rabies has been inherently low throughout its global historic range, explaining the success of control efforts in developed countries. However, we show that when birth and death rates in domestic dog populations are high, such as in our study populations in Tanzania, it is more difficult to maintain population-level immunity in between vaccination campaigns. Nonetheless, we conclude that, although the level of vaccination coverage required is higher than would be predicted from naïve transmission models, global elimination of canine rabies can be achieved through appropriately designed, sustained domestic dog vaccination campaigns.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/today_in_plos_biology.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/sh9adDvKEo0" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236737562776"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2468">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1208b5b1dda33dc1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="religion"/><category term="Bostonist Post"/><category term="Brazil"/><category term="Catholicism"/><category term="pedophiles"/><category term="rape"/><category term="Rebecca Watson"/><title type="html">Catholic Church needs money because raping children is expensive</title><published>2009-03-11T02:03:23Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T02:03:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/10/catholic-church-needs-money-because-raping-children-is-expensive/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let me tell you, &lt;span&gt;trying to bully 9-years-olds into giving birth isn’t cheap either.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here you have Barack Obama going in and spending the money on embryonic stem cell research, and then some, fundamentally changing - remember, those great progressive doctors are the ones who brought us Eugenics. It was the progressive movement and it was science. Let's put science truly in her place. If evolution is right, why don't we just help out evolution? That was the idea. And sane people agreed with it!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And it was from America. Progressive movement in America. Eugenics. In case you don&amp;#39;t know what Eugenics led us to: the Final Solution. A master race! A perfect person. That came from people in white coats. That came from the best and brightest because they were unhinged from any kind of ethics. They were unhin… they believed in evolution. It came from the scientific consensus. We&amp;#39;re headed back down there again. The stuff that we are facing is absolutely frightening. So I guess I have to put my name on yes, I hope Barack Obama fails. But I just want his policies to fail; I want America to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A curious, contradictory aspect of this Taoist Golden Rule was pointed out by the great 20th-century Chinese author, Lu Xun (1881-1936), who wrote the following in chapter 3 of his Han wenxue shi gangyao (An Outline of Chinese Literary History):  "Lao Zi's words are inconsistent.  He warned against prolixity, yet from time to time he gave vent to indignant words; he valued non-action, yet wished to rule all under heaven."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grammarians argue over whether this is an injunction ("do nothing") or a negative declarative sentence ("there is no action").  It is normally rendered in English as a noun.  Regardless of the part of speech, WU2WEI2 has had an enormous impact on Chinese thought for the past two millennia and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Afterword to &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/055334935X/"&gt;my Bantam translation of the Tao Te Ching / Dao De Jing&lt;/a&gt;, I pointed out a number of Sanskrit terms (e.g., AKRTA [non-action], AKARMA [inaction], NAISKARMYA [freedom from action or actionlessness], KARMANAM ANARAMBHAN [noncommencement of action] — diacriticals omitted here), especially numerous in the Bhagavad Gita, that mean essentially the same thing as WU2WEI2.  The Indian notions, while equally subtle and elusive, are quite different in their moral implications.  Whereas the Taoist concept is both ethical and socio-political, the Hindu complex of ideas is metaphysical and existential.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236730921115"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/10/old-folks-wing-of-the-blogodome/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e3adfa39f823246</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogosphere"/><title type="html">Old Folks Wing of the Blogodome</title><published>2009-03-11T00:19:55Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T00:19:55Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/10/old-folks-wing-of-the-blogodome/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The end of February marked &lt;a href="http://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2004_02_01_archive.html"&gt;five full years of blogging&lt;/a&gt; for me.

&lt;p&gt;After a half-decade, I can slack off a bit while I finish the book.  But here are some other goodies to keep you entertained on the internets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A few months ago, friend-of-the-blog George Musser from &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; visited us here in LA, and had some fascinating stories about the process of equipping his house with solar power.  We were like:  dude, that is totally bloggable.  And so it is!  George is telling his tale in &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/blog/60-second-solar/"&gt;a series of posts at the SciAm 60 Second Science site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neuromech.northwestern.edu/people/"&gt;Malcolm MacIver&lt;/a&gt;, a versatile engineer/philosopher/neuroscientist at Northwestern University, also flew out to LA a short while back to help the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/18/seex/"&gt;Science and Entertainment Exchange&lt;/a&gt; with a consultation for the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/"&gt;sequel to &lt;em&gt;TRON&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  He is now blogging about the experience at Northwestern’s &lt;a href="http://blog.scienceinsociety.northwestern.edu/"&gt;Science in Society&lt;/a&gt; blog:  &lt;a href="http://blog.scienceinsociety.northwestern.edu/2009/02/the-science-entertainment-exchange/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.scienceinsociety.northwestern.edu/2009/02/the-science-entertainment-exchange-part-ii/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.scienceinsociety.northwestern.edu/2009/03/the-science-entertainment-exchange-part-iii/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2008 edition of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823"&gt;The Open Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, collecting science blog posts from around the web, is now on sale.  Thanks to Bora Zivkovic and Jennifer Rohm for doing the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, use these threads to pimp out other things people should be reading.&lt;/p&gt;

The U.S. Office of Disability and Employment Policy has published a page on &lt;a href="http://www.dol.gov/odep/pubs/fact/advising.htm"&gt;Advising Youth with Disabilities on Disclosure: Tips for Service Providers&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a tidy table of some advantages and disadvantages to disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More interesting for the self-advocate is the &lt;a href="http://www.ncwd-youth.info/resources_&amp;amp;_Publications/411.html"&gt;The 411 on Disability Disclosure: A Workbook for Youth with Disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, put out by the &lt;a href="http://www.ncwd-youth.info/index.html"&gt;National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability&lt;/a&gt; (a treasure box of information on disability and employment in general).  The 411 is a huge workbook that covers the topics of self-determination, the importance of disclosure, advantages and disadvantages, disclosure and the law, accommodations, and disclosure in post-secondary education, employment, and community settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit I did not read the 99 page workbook in huge depth, but my impression was very positive.  It seems to do a great job of being relevant to any type of disability, including autism and any sorts of associated learning disabilities.  It was understandable to even my semantic/pragmatic quirks.  And while it's geared toward "youth" I think the information in it is fully applicable to many older adults--the issues with, and strategies for, disclosure don't really change between age 19 and age 29 or beyond.  My one major criticism is that the workbook is that it does not include any images to assist visual learners in understanding the material.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236724001900"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4193">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5896ab255fc0d990</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Transitional Fossils" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">Footprints through time</title><published>2009-03-10T22:16:44Z</published><updated>2009-03-11T05:41:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/03/footprints-thro.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/323/5918/1197" rel="external "&gt;A recent paper (Bennett et al. 2009)&lt;/a&gt; announced the discovery of 1.5 million year old fossilized footprints from Ileret, Kenya, almost certainly belonging to &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; (see also &lt;a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/226/1" rel="external "&gt;this commentary article&lt;/a&gt; by Ann Gibbons). &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; was already known from fossils such as the Turkana Boy to be very similar to modern humans below the neck, and completely adapted to bipedal locomotion. So it was no suprise when the footprint analysis showed that the owners of the Ileret footprints had a fully modern foot shape and were pushing off their big toes and shifting their weight exactly as modern humans do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answers in Genesis, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2009/03/07/news-to-note-03072009" rel="external "&gt;was delighted to report on this&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that it confirmed their belief that &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt; was a modern human (never mind the more primitive features of pelvis, shoulder and skull found in &lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;). So did the &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/4550/" rel="external "&gt;Institute for Creation Research&lt;/a&gt;. But AIG and ICR carefully avoided mentioning information from the paper that did not fit with their agenda.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another famous set of fossilized hominid footprints, the 3.7 million year old Laetoli footprints from Ethiopia, thought by scientists to belong to Lucy’s species, &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus afarensis&lt;/em&gt;, or something closely related to it. Creationists in general, and Answers in Genesis in particular, have always claimed that these are same as small modern human footprints (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v15/i4/hominid.asp" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/cfol/ch3-human-beings.asp" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The new paper however contains some evidence against that claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, Bennett and his colleagues compared the Ileret and Laetoli footprints, and concluded that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bennett et al. Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
… these [Ileret] prints are also morphologically distinct from the 3.75-million-year-old footprints at Laetoli, Tanzania
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A comparison of the instep width relative to the width in the metatarsal head region shows that the upper prints at FwJj14E [Ileret] fall within the modern human range and are distinct from the relatively wider insteps characterizing the Laetoli prints (Fig. 4C).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When compared to the Laetoli prints, the Ileret prints have a more contracted proximal mid-foot region, including a deeper instep (Fig. 4D), suggesting the presence of a medial longitudinal arch. The location of the narrowest point of the instep also lies farther forward (more distal) in the Laetoli prints than in both the modern and Ileret prints, possibly reflecting differences in foot proportions or a lack of definition of the instep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, contrary to the previous claims of creationists, the scientists found a number of significant differences between the Laetoli footprints and &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;sapiens&lt;/em&gt;) footprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And although the Ileret &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; individuals walked identically to modern humans, Bennett et al. did report one small anatomical difference between them and us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The angle of hallux abduction, relative to the long axis of the foot, is typically 14° compared to, and statistically distinct from (table S4), 8° for the modern reference prints and 27° for the Laetoli prints (Fig. 4A).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The hallux is the big toe, and abduction is the action of pulling the toe away from the line of the foot. Not to be confused with the opposite action, which is called a&lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;duction.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online supplementary material for the paper also shows that the creationist spin on the Laetoli footprints is way, way oversimplified. There is a wide range of opinion about the Laetoli prints, only a part of which is consistent with the creationist interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bennett et al. Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The interpretation of the Laetoli footprints has been and continues to be a matter of debate over whether they represent an essentially modern bipedal gait (S5-S9), a primitive gait (e.g., bent-hip, bent-knee) or unique form of gait (S10-S12), or whether the evidence to date is ambiguous (S13). Debate also continues over the interpretation of anatomy from the prints, with some researchers arguing that they point to a primitive foot structure bearing a slightly abducted hallux, relatively long, possibly curled lateral toes, and lacking both a medial longitudinal arch and evidence of a medial weight transfer (S10,S11,S14). Others instead argue that the Laetoli prints show evidence of a relatively modern human-like foot anatomy with evidence of a medial longitudinal arch (S5-S8), and these researchers point to the considerable variation in footprint structure, including variations in the degree of hallucal abduction and longitudinal arch height in the prints made by habitually shod and unshod modern humans (S6). Our study supports the hypotheses that the Laetoli prints were made by a foot whose hallux was much more adducted than in apes, but slightly and significantly more abducted than that of modern humans (Fig. 4A), with little positive evidence of medial weight transfer prior to push-off, or a longitudinal arch comparable to that seen in modern humans (Fig. S16). There is little doubt that compared to the modern great apes (S11, S15) the Laetoli prints and the hard tissue anatomy of contemporary hominins show evidence of a foot adapted for bipedalism including a more rigid tarsus but debate continues over whether the Laetoli footprints provide evidence of a modern human-like longitudinal arch (S6,S11).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, Answers in Genesis readers won’t be hearing about any of that…
&lt;/p&gt;

The US government is "the world's first genuinely autistic government"? So Chas W. Freeman, Jr.,&lt;br&gt;

It allows users to set tasks and major milestones, to upload files, to set due dates, and to monitor progress on any number of individual projects.  Aside from some minor hiccups with getting people in the lab to actually use it, I think it looks very useful.  The success of software like this depends on the growth of a strong user community, so if you have a group of people in your lab and need a way to keep everyone organized and on target, I suggest you try it sometime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://wiki.opengoo.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;amp;h=&amp;amp;cache=cache&amp;amp;media=full_screen_browser.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:600px;height:438px" src="http://wiki.opengoo.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=600&amp;amp;h=&amp;amp;cache=cache&amp;amp;media=full_screen_browser.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://opengoo.org/"&gt;OpenGoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href="http://opengoo.org/about.html"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://demo.opengoo.org/en_us/index.php?c=access&amp;amp;a=login"&gt;Demo&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://wiki.opengoo.org/doku.php"&gt;Manual&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-8855835095810317130?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/FpxfdTstKAI" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236717096735"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/10/tam-london-the-clock-is-ticking/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e6630c25c5eea03</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="JREF"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">TAM London: the clock is ticking!</title><published>2009-03-10T20:17:22Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T20:17:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/10/tam-london-the-clock-is-ticking/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update II: The link now works Yay!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you must know by now, The Amaz!ng Meeting is the premier critical thinking conference in the US. It’s held every year in Las Vegas, and &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/article/37-static/445-the-amazing-meeting-7.html"&gt;registration is open for TAM 7&lt;/a&gt;, which will be held July 9 - 12, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you’re in London? Well, first, consider yourself lucky to see Doctor Who on the night it airs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t help much if you want to go to Las Vegas, which is a third of the world away, and your TARDIS is on the fritz. What’s a Brit to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tamlondon.org/"&gt;How about attend TAM London&lt;/a&gt;? Yes, we’re holding a TAM across the pond, on 3 - 4 October, 2009. If you’re wondering just how long a wait that is, then you can visit the official TAM London website, which has a countdown clock download for both Mac and PCs which you can install and use to breathlessly anticipate the very first international TAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the site will have more specifics, like our list of brilliant speakers. For now, though, download the clocks and use them to pace yourself.

It's like a Snow Day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, getting kicked out of work just means I have to go home to Morris. In a blizzard. With everything shut down and locked up tight. Well, I hope I don&amp;#39;t get lost in a whiteout and freeze to death while trying to find the door to my house…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:37. Made it home, covered in snow. All that wind also blows the snow in through every crevice — took my coat off and shed snow on everything. Afraid to go to the bathroom now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:10. Have discovered that the cupboard is bare. Should have stockpiled food yesterday. Too late now — the car is a chunk of ice, and there&amp;#39;s no way I&amp;#39;m walking outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemplating cannibalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3:28. Darn. Wife is snowbound in Willmar and will be spending the night there, so I'm going to be home alone. There goes the cannibalism idea. May have to carve out a chunk of my own thigh to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait! The cat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:48. Took a long hard look at the cat. I'm not that hungry. Back to palpitating thigh for tenderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:01. CAAAAABBIIIIIIIIIIINNNN FEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVER!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4:32. I'm feeling better now. I found the &lt;a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/484667"&gt;Narwhal song&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm playing it over and over. I won't go insane now, no sir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Narwhals, Narwhals, swimmin' in the ocean causing a commotion 'cause they are so awesome". They are the jedi of the sea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:05! Wait! I found everything I need for waffles! And some hot cocoa mix hidden away in a cupboard! I&amp;#39;m saved! Waffle orgy at my house tonight! Sanity…restored!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm still going to be singing that Narwhal song for a while, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two generations, evangelicalism will be a house deserted of half its occupants. (Between 25 and 35 percent of Americans today are Evangelicals.) In the "Protestant" 20th century, Evangelicals flourished. But they will soon be living in a very secular and religiously antagonistic 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I believe it will happen? I confess that there's a good bit of wishful thinking on my part that clouds my judgment, but I have high hopes, and I think it entirely possible. This particular article is especially interesting because it is published in the &lt;i&gt;Christian Science Monitor&lt;/i&gt;, and it's written by a Christian (well, more accurately, "a postevangelical reformation Christian in search of a Jesus-shaped spirituality," whatever that means), writing as an insider with intimate knowledge of the evangelical movement. He's not happy about it, either, which makes the article an interesting read just because every time he intones an article of woe in his litany of doom, I'm feeling like pumping a fist in the air and shouting "Yes!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He places the blame on several factors. 1) Evangelicals hitched their wagon to conservative politics, and that cart is busted. 2) Christian media has been superficial and failed to teach them the basics of their belief (which I don&amp;#39;t think is quite as damaging as he thinks—teaching the actual scripture is a great way to make atheists). 3) Megachurches. Enough said. 4) Christian education has failed. 5) Christianity has become a taint rather than a selling point in efforts to do good works. 6) Confidence in the bible and faith are waning. And probably most importantly, 7) &amp;quot;The money will dry up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One caveat to his explanations, though, is that he is making specific predictions about a very narrow part of the Christian spectrum, evangelicalism. We still have to worry about the crazy Charismatics, the freaky Fundamentalists, the conservative Catholics, and all those weird little splinter sects all over the place. Christianity isn't going to simply vanish, it's simply going to submerge for a bit, be a little less flamboyant and openly money-hungry, and maybe be a little less politically influential. Those are good outcomes all around, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also wants to predict that a new and vital Christianity can arise from the ruins. Let&amp;#39;s hope not — I want to see a clearing away of the detritus of superstition to allow for a new Enlightenment to shine forth, instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/alas_alas_that_great_city_baby.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/Pot3XRrFZOs" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236712144852"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/cant_we_all_get_along.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eec0c2c383ff1bb3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Can't we all get along?</title><published>2009-03-10T18:38:01Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T18:38:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/TRaUDIgb6QM/cant_we_all_get_along.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/cant_we_all_get_along.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Phelps gang is picketing in Chicago with their "god hates fags" sign.

Like me, she worries about spreading the word about those two endeavors in the Spanish speaking world, where inroads seem to be tough. So she took &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/20/why-is-science-important/"&gt;my recent video&lt;/a&gt; on why science is important, created a Spanish transcript, and posted it with the video on &lt;a href="http://www.andercismo.com/2009/03/la-ciencia-es-importante.html"&gt;the andercismo website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting interest in science and skepticism into the Spanish-speaking world is a goal of mine, so I’m glad she’s taking the time to do this. If you speak Spanish, go take a look. And if you teach in a predominantly Spanish-speaking area, please feel free to use this video and transcription!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but she took my recent interview on The History Channel program &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/05/i-herald-the-apocalypse-tonight-on-tv/"&gt;&amp;quot;Seven Signs of the Apocalypse&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; which had Spanish captioning, broke it up into digestible parts, and posted the video on TeacherTube (like YouTube but safe for teachers). This means teachers can use the videos in school, which is something of which I approve con mucho gusto!&lt;/p&gt;

That social information may include information such as stereotypes or labels like "intelligent" or "lazy" (the study used photographs and written descriptions rather than direct observation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impressions and labels have been suggested by Robert Axelrod to be &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KFf2HXzVO58C&amp;amp;pg=PA146&amp;amp;vq=labels&amp;amp;dq=axelrod+cooperation+labels&amp;amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;amp;cad=0"&gt;one way for people to quickly understand whether they should cooperate or double-cross&lt;/a&gt; in an interaction.  How does a person decide whether to cooperate with another or look out only for their own interest in an interaction at any cost? If nothing is known about a partner or that partner is not to be trusted, then it might be better to double-cross.  But if the person can be reasonably sure their partner will cooperate, then its might be better to also cooperate.  In a world where one must decide whether a potential partner is trustworthy in order to make a decision, first impressions and labels are one way (presumably) to assess the degree of trustworthiness or to anticipate the partner's actions in order to develop a good strategy for interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a first impression based on the observable characteristics of someone who does not behave in ways aligned with social norms &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/mental_models_observable_behavior_and_disability"&gt;may be disastrously erroneous&lt;/a&gt;.  If a person is averting their gaze, it might mean they are untrustworthy and lying...or, in the case of an autistic person, it might mean nothing at all beyond an honest dislike of eyeball-to-eyeball gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impressions based on stereotypes and labels instead of on observations can also be problematic.  What value judgement might come along with the label "autism"--does the label stigmatize or aid in understanding?  Does it generate fear?  Or cause misplaced adoration?  Does "autism" give a a negative first impression more like "lazy" or a positive first impression more like "intelligent?"  I've often heard people cite not wanting the label to make a first impression on someone as a reason not to disclose, or even a reason not to get a diagnosis at all for fear the label will become accidentally known to others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, an autism label might mean an improved first impression, as it could help avoid a first impression based on misunderstood social behavior like averted eye gaze.  Instead of distrust in the eye gaze case, the first impression might be based instead on the actual substance of the interaction.  In a culture that has good acceptance and understanding of autism or disabilities, the negative value judgments associated with the label are not present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels are indeed a &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/double-edged_sword"&gt;double edged sword&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236704641717"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4553">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/436f20ed9394427f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="eric morris" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="LA: Fact and Fiction" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="Los Angeles" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><category term="traffic" scheme="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com"/><title type="html">Los Angeles Transportation Facts and Fiction: Driving and Delay</title><published>2009-03-10T16:29:41Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T16:29:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/los-angeles-transportation-facts-and-fiction-driving-and-delay/" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/los-angeles-transportation-facts-and-fiction-driving-and-delay/#comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/los-angeles-transportation-facts-and-fiction-driving-and-delay/feed/atom/" type="application/atom+xml"/><summary xml:base="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/wp-atom.php" xml:lang="en" type="html">Time to bring the quiz to a close.

Yes, it's not an actual language, but just some playful vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(Hat tip to Doug Kenter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the Snickers people's first brush with playful vocabulary; back in 2006, I reported &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003514.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on an earlier advertising campaign using playful morphology, in particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hungerectomy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;peanutopolis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;nougatocity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;substantialiscious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;satisfectellent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the current campaign. According to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snickers campaign, by the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, is being rolled out in stages. The initial phase, which gets under way this week, includes outdoor ads and content on the Snickers Web site (&lt;a href="http://snickers.com/"&gt;snickers.com&lt;/a&gt;) as well as Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Television commercials are scheduled to begin appearing next week. And there will be more content on snickers.com in the spring, including a way to translate regular language into the Snickers lingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snacklish is a humorous way of speaking that revises everyday words and phrases for a Snickers-centric world. To underscore their origin, they are printed in the typeface and colors of the Snickers brand logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the basketball great Patrick Ewing becomes Patrick Chewing. Combine the rapper Master P with the peanut, a main ingredient of Snickers, and he turns into Master P-nut — perhaps a hip-hop relation of the Planters brand mascot, Mr. Peanut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples include a Snickers taxi, or snaxi; peanutarium, for planetarium; and chompensation, for compensation. And the Sigma Nu fraternity is transformed into Sigma Nougat, after another Snickers ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The article has a photo of a Snaxi.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Snickers site: &lt;em&gt;chewconomy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;chompetition&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MVP-nut&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nougativity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nougetaboutit&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nutopia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nutlegience&lt;/em&gt; [as in "pledge nutlegience"], &lt;em&gt;nutvana&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;satisfocalypse&lt;/em&gt; [as in "the Four Horsemen of the Satisfocalypse"], &lt;em&gt;snaxophone&lt;/em&gt;. Plus a link to the Snickers Facebook site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snacklish plays on ordinary vocabulary by introducing parts (or all) of Snickers-related words into it: &lt;em&gt;chew&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;chomp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nougat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nut&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;peanut&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;satisfy/satisfaction/satisfactory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;snack&lt;/em&gt;. Not a hard game to play, but some of the combinations are stretches, and need some context to be interpretable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Arnold Zwicky</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236703633665"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/how_creationism_should_be_taug.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc11ef11d2e97815</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">How creationism should be taught in the classroom</title><published>2009-03-10T17:35:40Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T17:35:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/tR07kXmtsEw/how_creationism_should_be_taug.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/how_creationism_should_be_taug.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Schools in Hampshire, England are receiving &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/4961698/Creationism-should-be-taught-in-science-lessons.html"&gt;information on how to incorporate creationism into the classroom&lt;/a&gt;. It's hard to judge whether this is good or bad without seeing the actual materials, but I'm inclined to say it's probably a bad idea, since it's supported by people claiming the point is to "analyse different views in a balanced way." That is the wrong way to teach this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I incorporate creationism into my introductory biology course, too, but I don't think I do it quite the way creationists want. What they want is that we be respectful of their views, explain it as an alternative, and nod sagely in the direction of Charles Darwin &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Philip Johnson. We got a picture of what they want in Dover, Pennsylvania, when the school board mandated a vague statement about critical thinking that did not actually exercise any critical thought, and that waved a hand in the direction of some fifth-rate books that students ought to examine. No, that's not how you teach a subject in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I'm teaching a course in transmission genetics right now. If I taught it the creationist way, I would have said something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uh, this is a course in the theory of genetics. There are some other theories out there, maybe you can find some books on them somewhere, but, ummm, keep an open mind. We teach something about genes getting passed down from generation to generation. That's enough. There are some other details, I suppose, but right now we should spend some time on preformation and acquired characters, which I suppose are equivalent theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I could be done and sit down for the rest of the term. It sure would be easier. That&amp;#39;s the thing about creationist &amp;quot;ideas&amp;quot; — they&amp;#39;re so danged fuzzy and unteachable, either falsified already or so incoherent that they&amp;#39;re untestable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I actually teach genetics is essentially a temporal series of criticisms. I start with Darwin's pangenesis for a little historical background, and tell them this is &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, and here's why, criticizing it on the basis of it's ad hoc nature and its failure to fit experimental observations. Then I introduce Mendel, and we see his view of particulate, quantifiable inheritance, and how it superseded Darwin, and then I show how parts of it are &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, with experiments that show how it fails, which leads into linkage. And then I show how some of our initial concepts of chromosomal inheritance are &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, with work done on extrachromosomal factors. Step by step, we build a case for a complex and detailed understanding of the rules of heredity by experiment…where even the experiments that go &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; (that is, don&amp;#39;t show us the results we expected from existing theory) help us acquire a deeper understanding of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, it's a pretty ruthless business. Weak handwaving, of the sort that Darwin was doing in his theory of inheritance, doesn't cut it and gets chopped apart savagely with the bloody cleaver of experiment. Creationism is far, far weaker than Darwin's 19th century proposal, so you can guess how it fares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the proponents of creationism ask that their nonsense be taught in school, there is an implicit expectation that the scientists will put away their implements of destruction and suspend the savagery while their delicate little flower of unsupportable fluff is discussed reverentially. That is not going to happen. If it did, it wouldn't be a science class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lesson plan that includes creationism should plainly show that experiment and observation have irrefutably demonstrated that it is now a splintered pile of cack-minded gobshite, wrecked by a century and a half of discovery, and that its supporters now are reduced to pathetically feeble rationalizations that rely almost entirely on people&amp;#39;s emotional dependence on the legitimacy of their religious beliefs. A science class isn&amp;#39;t the place to rip into airy-fairy religiosity — we have other venues for that — but it should uncompromisingly demolish &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; attempt to link natural, material events to pious metaphysics. If a student comes out of such a class believing that maybe there is still something to the Genesis explanation of the origins of life, then the instructor has not done her job. Her job was to explain with &lt;i&gt;science&lt;/i&gt; how the world works, and if anyone wants to smuggle in the seven days and the magic fruit tree and the talking snake, it should be so the teacher can show the students that that is &lt;b&gt;not how it works&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm willing to grant creationism an hour or two in the classroom, as long as its role is to be an easy victim, to demonstrate how science can be used to eviscerate bad ideas (I also know from experience that most students find that extremely entertaining, as well as informative). From what I've seen of most of the creationist curricula advanced by these quacks, that isn't what they want. To which we have to say, then it isn't science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/how_creationism_should_be_taug.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/tR07kXmtsEw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236702927083"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/calling_all_air_america_fans_calling_all.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/88df3e8b58f901fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">Calling all Air America fans, calling all Air America fans!</title><published>2009-03-10T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/JpnR9ZhqzcM/calling_all_air_america_fans_calling_all.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/calling_all_air_america_fans_calling_all.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crank alert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age of Autism has &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/03/david-kirby-and-robert-f-kennedy-jr-on-the-david-bender-show-today.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/stupid_cubed_david_kirby_rfk_jr_and_gene.php"&gt;David Kirby and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr&lt;/a&gt;. will be on the &lt;a href="http://airamerica.com/thedavidbendershow"&gt;David Bender Show&lt;/a&gt; at 1:15 PM today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if, to counter the antivaccine activists, reality-based listeners would call in, although I am very pessimistic that Bender would give them a fair shake, given that he has &lt;a href="http://airamerica.com/thedavidbendershow/blog/2009/mar/09/limbaugh-right"&gt;said this about Deepak Chopra&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had the pleasure of interviewing a man whose work I've admired for many years, but had never met--Dr. Deepak Chopra.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any man who admires Deepak Chopra's work has a serious problem with reality. I've never listened to Bender's show before, but perusing his website does not give me any confidence that he is any more science-based than, say, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, or Mark Levin, for example. Here's a hint: Embracing Deepak Chopra just because he has written a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/rush-limbaugh-icon-of-ant_b_172900.html"&gt;screed against Rush Limbaugh&lt;/a&gt; is not a good idea if you want to lay claim to the mantle of being part of the "reality-based" community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/calling_all_air_america_fans_calling_all.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/JpnR9ZhqzcM" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236702695456"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/10/spread-the-joy-of-astronomy-with-a-galileoscope/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f345508b683e8f7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="IYA"/><title type="html">Spread the joy of astronomy with a Galileoscope</title><published>2009-03-10T16:18:54Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T16:18:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/10/spread-the-joy-of-astronomy-with-a-galileoscope/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;400 years ago this year, people first started turning the newly invented telescope to the sky, and were astonished at what they saw. Galileo, not a fool when it came to self-promotion (though he stumbled a bit later in life), drew up what he saw and published it… starting a revolution in not just astronomy but in all of science, all of humanity. The aftershocks still reverberate today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His telescope was crude by today’s standards; lens making wasn’t nearly the craft then that it is now. But it was enough to see craters on the Moon, satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and Saturn’s rings. And now, thanks to the International Year of Astronomy, you can experience what Galileo did and, even cooler, share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.galileoscope.org/gs/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/galileoscope.jpg" alt="Galileoscope"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the Cornerstone projects of IYA 2009 is the creation of &lt;a href="https://www.galileoscope.org/gs/"&gt; the Galileoscope&lt;/a&gt;, a replica of what Galileo used to view the heavens. This little ’scope sports a glass 50mm (2 inch) lens, tough plastic casing, eyepiece, and a Barlow lens which doubles the magnification. Its construction is extremely simple, so a small child can assemble it in minutes with a little help from a grown-up. I saw one recently, and I was &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; impressed. It was well-built and quite functional. &lt;a href="https://www.galileoscope.org/gs/content/galileoscope-news"&gt;You can see images of it in action on the Galileoscope site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most incredible thing about this ’scope is the price: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.galileoscope.org/gs/products"&gt;you can buy one for just $15!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The overriding goal of this project was to make the telescopes as cheaply as possible, so that they could be bought and sent around the world, fulfilling my very favorite goal of IYA 2009: getting everyone who is physically capable of it to observe the heavens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make that even easier, the people behind the Galileoscope project have set it up so that &lt;a href="https://www.galileoscope.org/gs/content/give-galileoscope"&gt;you can donate a telescope anonymously for only $12.50&lt;/a&gt;. When you do this, some organization somewhere in the world will get a ’scope. It may be a school in Africa, or Viet Nam, or America, or in England. But some group that needs it will get your gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before writing this post, I bought three: one donated anonymously, one for me to play for a night or two and then give to The Little Astronomer’s school, and one for you. That’s right, when they get here, I will be giving one away on the blog. I’ll announce it when I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the meantime, why not check out &lt;a href="https://www.galileoscope.org/gs/"&gt;the Galileoscope page&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a teacher, especially a science or history teacher, one of these will really bring the classroom alive. And whoever you are, why not donate one to someone, somewhere on Earth? We all deserve the sky, I think, and a gift like this literally delivers to the heavens to someone who needs it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236701575160"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-1889993565161712308">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a66fa9c13f46933</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Faith is Not an Acceptable Answer</title><published>2009-03-10T13:59:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T15:05:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/NVqOTFAk8Yw/faith-is-not-acceptable-answer.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/1889993565161712308/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=1889993565161712308" title="79 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/faith-is-not-acceptable-answer.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">We’ve argued against the concept of faith many times before, but let me try again. I have argued that the Christian faith originated as a &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2009/03/fitting-pieces-together-christian.html"&gt;purely human religion&lt;/a&gt; completely accountable by humans acting in history without needing any divine agency at all. But setting that important discussion aside, faith is a cop out, especially when it comes to the number of things Christians must take on faith in order to believe. Let’s recount some of them. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) No reasonable answer can be given for why a triune God, who was perfect in love neither needing nor wanting anything, created in the first place. &lt;em&gt;Grace &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Love &lt;/em&gt;are non-answers, especially when we see the actual world that resulted. For Christians to say God wanted human creatures who freely love him is nonsense, for why did he want this at all? If love must be expressed then God needed to express his love and that implies a lack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) It’s hard enough to conceive of one person who is an eternally uncaused God, much less a Godhead composed of three eternally uncaused persons. There are some Christians who maintain the Father eternally created the Logos and the Spirit, while others claim that three persons in one Godhead is simply an eternally brute inexplicable fact. Why is that brute fact more reasonable to accept than accepting the brute fact of the laws of the universe, which is all that’s needed to produce the universe? There are social Trinitarians and anti-social Trinitarians. Both sides accuse the other side of abandoning the Chalcedon creed, either in the direction of tri-theism, or in the direction of unitarianism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) This triune Godhead is also conceived of as a timeless being who was somehow able to create the first moment of time. How a timeless being could actually do this is extremely problematic. For if his decision to create a first moment of time is an eternal one, then there could be no temporal gap between his decision to create the first moment of time and the actual creation of the first moment of time. If there was no temporal gap between God's eternal decision to create a first moment of time and the creation of that first moment, then his decision to create would alone be sufficient for a first moment of time to be created. God could not eternally decide to create at any future point since there is no future point for him to create. So if a timelessly eternal God decided to create at all then the universe is eternal and never had a first moment in time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4) This timelessly eternal triune God who parodoxically created time must now forever be subject to events in time. He cannot become timeless again, for to do so would destroy all that happened in time as if these events never happened at all. So although God somehow existed outside of time before creating the first moment of time he must now forever experience a sequence of events. Whereas before creation he was a timelessly existing being he is now going to forever experience a sequence of events that is never ending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From here it only gets worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5) We are told that the Logos, the 2nd person of the trinity, became a man. No conception of this God-man in the flesh has yet been able to stand scrutiny. How, for instance, can such a being be 100% God and 100% man with nothing left over? All attempts to solve this problem have failed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6) But we’re not done, for we’re told this God-man atoned for the sins of man. No sense can be made of how the death of Jesus actually forgives sins. There is no relationship between punishment and forgiveness at all. We forgive people who have not been punished and sometimes we won’t forgive people even after they've been punished. To say that in order to forgive someone they must first be punished does not describe forgiveness at all, anyway. It describes revenge. Revenge can never be a moral reason for acting and revenge has nothing to do with offering forgiveness. We don't even need for people to ask forgiveness in order to forgive them. Sometimes it's better for our mental health to forgive someone regardless of whether or not they're even sorry for what they've done.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7) This God-man was a unique never-before-existing being who is described in the creeds as one unified person. Here an additional problem surfaces. Where is the human side of this God-man now (i.e. the human nature of Jesus)? Since this human side of the God-man was sinless he couldn’t be destroyed, nor could this human side of the God-man be separated from the divine side, for such a being was now one person according to the creeds. So theologians have concluded that the trinity includes an embodied Logos. Now we have a trinity with an embodied 2nd person in it. Picture this if you will!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8) Stepping forward a bit, sinners sent to hell retain their free will, since it’s argued they continue to rebel in hell, while the saints who enter heaven have their free will taken away to guarantee there will be no future rebellion in heaven. If free will is such a great gift why reward people by taking it away from them and punish people by having them retain it? That makes little sense to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve only touched on a few of the beliefs needed to make sense of Christianity. There are many others, and some Christians have different scenarios. But who in their right mind would embrace Christianity if he or she heard about them all when first being challenged to believe? Very few people. That’s what I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we’re not done yet. For there is the additional problem of the lack of evidence for these beliefs. Archaeology disconfirms the flood and Exodus stories. What we have are the claims of people who wrote the books that later were accepted into the Bible. Why should I believe what they wrote? Why should I believe that the sun stood still, or that a star pointed down to a specific place, or that a virgin gave birth, or that a man walked on the water just because of what a person in the superstitious past wrote? Even in the Bible itself we see how the people of that same era believed in the actions of gods and goddesses like Apollo, Zeus, Baal, Artemis, and others, which hardly anyone accepts today. So why do Christians accept one set of claims in the past but reject the others? The same evidence supports them all: Testimonies by superstitious people in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians must defend too many beliefs, any one of which, if incorrect, would be fatal to their whole worldview. These beliefs are based upon the conclusions of historical evidence which is extremely problematic given the nature of that evidence and the nature of the superstitious pre-scientific people in the ancient past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians must defend things like the existence of the social Trinitarian God (versus an anti-social Trinitarian God) of the Bible (which had a long process of formation and of borrowing material from others) who never began to exist and will never cease to exist (even though everything we experience has a beginning and an end), who never learned any new truths, who does not think (for thinking demands weighing temporal alternatives), who is not free with respect to deciding his own nature, who revealed himself through a poor medium (history) in a poor era (ancient times), who condemns all of humanity for the sins of the first human pair, who commanded genocide, who allows intense suffering in this world (yet does not follow the same moral code he commands believers to follow), whose Son (the 2nd person of the trinity) became incarnate in Jesus (even though no one has ever made sense of a person who is 100% man and 100% divine) to be punished for our sins (even though there is no correlation between punishment and forgiveness) who subsequently bodily arose from the dead (even though the believer in miracles has an almost impossible double-burden of proof here) and now lives embodied forever in a “spiritual” human body who will return to earth in the parousia (even though the NT is clear that the end of all kingdoms and the establishment of God's kingdom was to be in their generation), who sent the 3rd person of the trinity to lead his followers into "all truth" (yet fails in every generation to do this), who will also judge us based upon what conclusions we reach about the existence of this God and what he has done (paralleling the ancient barbaric thought police), and who will reward believers by taking away their freedom and punish the dammed by letting them retain their freedom?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the larger the claim is the less probable it is, the Christian faith is simply too improbable to be believed by reasonable people. Period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-1889993565161712308?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader Davery sent in &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2213287/"&gt;this link to a &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; on Obama’s recent reversal of the Bush administration’s ban on stem cell research: &lt;em&gt;Winning Smugly: You just won the stem-cell war. Don’t lose your soul.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, if you’re new to &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; the main thing to remember is that they earn their ad revenue by being contrarian. If you say torture is bad, they’ll argue that sometimes it’s good. If you liked Wall-E’s message, &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2195126/"&gt;they’ll find someone to say it was a terrible message&lt;/a&gt;. If they say Suze Orman is terrible, then . . . well, &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5150631/slate-badmouths-its-own-suze-orman-takedown"&gt;they’ll also say she’s got some great ideas&lt;/a&gt;. Whether or not you agree with any of that, the point is that this is the purpose &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt; serves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it’s no surprise that they found William Saletan to tell us crazy liberals to just calm the hell down. Saletan is concerned because: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embryos are the beginnings of people. They’re not parts of people. They’re the whole thing, in very early form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds a bit like Saletan believes that an embryo is a homunculus, a tiny person waiting inside to grow larger and emerge from the womb. If he believes that the entire person is contained within an embryo, then surely crushing some acorns would be as upsetting as clear-cutting an old-growth forest. It’s not, though, because we understand that a seed is not an organism – it’s only different from other cells because of the possibilities we imagine for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, buried within the article is the sentence that renders the point moot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It seems worse to let the girl die for the embryo’s sake than to kill the embryo for the girl’s sake, particularly since embryos left over from fertility treatments will be discarded or left to die, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what this decision was really about: whether or not we can use trashed embryos to save countless lives. Saletan’s entire argument is based on a slippery slope: if we allow testing on embryos that would otherwise be thrown in the garbage, we’ll soon allow embryos to be created and destroyed for testing purposes. And then, and then, and then, who knows? This argument is familiar to those fighting for equal rights for homosexuals, since really the only non-Bible-based argument against allowing gays to marry is to argue that next thing you know, ducks will be marrying oysters. In this case, the only non-Bible-based argument against making use of someone’s garbage is that next thing you know, we’ll be ransacking orphanages in search of unwitting organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saletan calls this a “war” as a way to tie all those ideas together, insinuating that now that we’ve won we’ll have our ugly way with stem cells and abuse morality as we see fit. But that’s not true: there are still strict regulations in place, and people will carefully weigh the options at every stage, as they should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the current stage, I’ll go out on a limb and say that there is not a damn thing that is immoral about testing on trashed embryos. Further, it was &lt;em&gt;outrageously immoral&lt;/em&gt; to allow embryos to go to waste in the name of morality when those cells could so positively affect our lives. This wasn’t a war – it was a crime, which we’ve finally stopped.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236698189609"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=4455">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b761d14689f36959</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="disability"/><category term="healthcare"/><category term="unintended consequences"/><title type="html">The Price of Disability Law</title><published>2009-03-10T14:51:47Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T14:51:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/x9t2Xrf5R1o/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/the-price-of-disability-law/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">We &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20wwln-freak-t.html"&gt;wrote a column&lt;/a&gt; a while back about a variety of powerful unintended consequences.

For years I've been confused as to whether "Goths", "Geats", and "Jutes" are the same people with different spellings, related people with different spellings, or different people with coincidentally-similar names. Also, where "derek" (or "dietrich", or "teodric") comes from.  Is it goth, or hun, or something else?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's really easy to get confused here, because we're dealing both with historical reality and with historical fiction written a long time ago.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths"&gt;Goths&lt;/a&gt;: a Germanic-speaking ethnic group that took a major part in Migration Period politics in southern Europe. Their migrations can be traced back to a starting point in northern Poland in the 1st century. According to legends written down in the 6th century, the Goths believed that they had come from Scandinavia prior to that. But so did almost every other roving tribe at the time. Safest bet: the Goths came from Poland. (But in Scandinavia there were groups with similar names -- in the 6th century.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Goths" and "Gothic" have since acquired a number of secondary meanings, originally because historians of art chose to call the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_art"&gt;architectural style&lt;/a&gt; of the High Middle Ages with pointy arches "Gothic". Then anything having to do with old romantic ruins came to be called Gothic, then anything horrific, then anything having to do with an 80s musical subculture. &lt;i&gt;First and Last and Always&lt;/i&gt; is actually a pretty good album.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geats"&gt;Geats&lt;/a&gt;: these are a semi-fictional group of &lt;i&gt;the past&lt;/i&gt; spoken about by a few Anglo-Saxon writers in the later 1st Millennium, notably the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beowulf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; poet. What we're dealing with is most likely the Anglo-Saxons' poorly conceived idea of the Götar in current Sweden. The Beowulf poet clearly knew nothing whatsoever about Sweden.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutes"&gt;Jutes&lt;/a&gt;: inhabitants of Jutland in Denmark. Anglo-Saxon writers in the later 1st Millennium believed that Jutes were among the Germanic-speakers who took power in the Isles after the Roman withdrawal in AD 409/410. Linguistic and X-chromosomal evidence suggests rather that the new lords came from Frisia.
&lt;li&gt;Derek = Dietrich = Theodoric: a Gothic name meaning "people-king", most famously worn by an Ostrogothic King, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodoric_the_Great"&gt;Theodoric the Great&lt;/a&gt; (454-526), who ruled Italy from his capital at Ravenna. In High Medieval historical fiction, he is dimly remembered as Dietrich von Bern.&lt;p&gt;Collecting links for all these things in Wikipedia, I find that much of what the encyclopedia says is woefully outdated, being based on old scholarship with poor standards of source-criticism, where old historical fiction tended to be used as sources of historical facts. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/gothic_confusion.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/kNgajJFePQo" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236694480160"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1217">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/157c3bc06b7ee953</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">Metaphorical dinosaurs</title><published>2009-03-10T14:14:23Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T14:14:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1217" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;Dinosaur Comics&lt;/em&gt;, DIRECTION IS A BUCKET THAT PEOPLE KEEP SNEAKING INTO (with no apologies to George Lakoff):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason #1 is my iPhone. As I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/bizarre_iphone_behavior_or_is_it_att.php"&gt;mentioned the other day&lt;/a&gt;, the microphone mysteriously stopped working while I was in Phoenix. At first I thought it was a network thing, as on less rare than I would like occasions I had had difficulty with AT&amp;amp;T in which I might have trouble making a phone call or people I called couldn&amp;#39;t hear me even though I could hear them. But the problem persisted after I got home. (In restrospect, I wonder if the occasional problems I had had when people couldn&amp;#39;t hear me after I connected were the canary in the coal mine for this total meltdown.) It was all very frustrating, as everything else about the phone appeared to work fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday evening after work I made a stop at the nearest Apple Store, which, unfortunately, is not nearly as near as I would like, if you know what I mean, having first made an appointment at the Genius Bar. The Apple dude was attentive as I explained my problem. He had a hard time verifying it because the store was so noisy and in fact had to take the phone into the back of the store where it was quieter before he could verify that, yes, in fact the microphone didn't work. He then tried doing some sort of super-duper reset that only a technician can do and then completely reinstalling the iPhone software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, your friendly neighorhood Apple Store swapped out my non-functional old iPhone for a new one. The whole process, including analysis, reinstalling the software once, and then initializing and activating the replacement iPhone took close to an hour.

Prof. Dawkins gave a lecture on “The Purpose of Purpose” to a sold-out crowd at the Wharton Center on the evening of the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, and held an hour-and-a-half question and answer session at the Fairchild Theater on campus in the morning of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Original post at the &lt;a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2009/03/09/richard-dawkins-and-the-purpose-of-purpose/" rel="external "&gt;Austringer&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fred Dyer, head of MSU’s Zoology Department, introduced Prof. Dawkins to a sold-out crowd in the Wharton Center main theater. A part of the WorldViews Lecture Series, this event was the first to completely sell out the main seating area and balcony for a lecture rather than a performance at the Wharton Center. A comparison to a lecture by Stephen Jay Gould several years ago cannot be made, since the organizers for that one booked only a smaller room at the Wharton Center and were dismayed to have to turn away a large number of people seeking admission. That sort of organizational miscue was avoided for Prof. Dawkins’ appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Dawkins titled his talk as “The Purpose of Purpose” and began with an anecdote of Peter Atkins being asked by one of the Royal Family, “But what about the ‘why’ questions?”, and Atkins replying, “That is a silly question.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins noted that asking ‘why’ for inanimate objects like air or rocks is almost always considered inappropriate. But asking ‘why’ living organisms are seems to often have been done in the past. He noted a number of amusing instances, such as claims that domestic animals provide a means to keep their meat fresh until we have need to eat them, lice were a strong incentive to personal cleanliness, large predators allowed hunters to test their courage, and horseflies encouraged industry and the use of wits in combatting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mindset persists to this day, said Dawkins, popping up the Ray Comfort “banana” video, which got an especially large dollop of audience laughter with Comfort’s assertion that the banana has just the right shape to fit in the human mouth. Dawkins noted that, unfortunately, the video was not simply a joke. Comfort apparently has offered to give Dawkins $10,000 to debate Comfort. Dawkins responded saying that he would take Comfort up on that only if Comfort donated $100K to Dawkins’ new foundation. Then Dawkins compared the modern, domesticated version of the banana to the fruit of the wild banana, showing that many of the properties that Comfort was ascribing to God’s design were actually choices made in artificial selection by humans. Some of the attitudes remain even in those who have abandoned a religious viewpoint, especially when it comes to seeing humans as part of the panoply of life and not separate from it, as when people ascribe the grave sin of murder to aborting a human fetus, while cheerfully eating a cow. The question to be asked is not whether something can reason, or talk, but rather whether it can &lt;em&gt;suffer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins went on to talk about artificial selection as a transition to natural selection. Corn, for example, has been selected in varieties that minimize and maximize the oil content, with dramatic increases in oil content seen in the one, and values of oil content close to zero in the other. Roses demonstrate the extent to which human artificial selection can take things. But it must be recognized that human selection of roses picks up where natural selection done by insects has left off. Flowers show the lengths that adaptation in plants can go to avoid the phenomena of self-fertilization. Wind pollination only goes so far. Many flowers now bribe pollinators to carry their pollen. A Madagascar orchid that was examined by both Darwin and Wallace illustrates this, as the “dangly thing” restricts pollination to a pollinator with a thin tongue of some 11 inches in length. Darwin and Wallace predicted this, and later Darwin’s Hawk Moth was discovered, an animal with the predicted long tongue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural selection is non-random success, and represents another way to improve. All living things are “survival machines”, where every species preserves its genes in a different way. Humans do this by thinking. And so we can give a new view of purpose, where purpose for living organisms is to preserve and propagate their genes, to work hard and make copies of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As related by Dawkins, humans appear to be a major exception to this view of purpose. Naive Darwinism has no explanation for things like contraception and adoption. Adoption is a wonderful thing, it just isn’t very Darwinian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Dawkins got to the essential framework of the rest of his talk, making a distinction within purpose between the purpose that comes about as adaptation via natural selection, which he called “archi-purpose”, and the purpose that comes about through the intent of a planning brain, which he called “neo-purpose”. Archi-purpose, then, resembles an intentional purpose, but is not such: the resemblance is an illusion. Neo-purpose, as Dawkins views it, is itself an evolved adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain viewed as an on-board computer sets up goals, or neo-purposes. Dawkins raised the question of whether man-made machines can, themselves, have neo-purposes? And he answered in the affirmative on that, noting that machines like guided missiles can seek goals. He did note that certain other inventions, like cannonballs, were destructive but did not have the goal-seeking or even goal-setting property that underlies neo-purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins moved on to what goals could be seen in animal behavior, bringing up bat biosonar as an instance. He also considered the simple guidance system of maggots where they use a negative phototaxis to get to a food source as a low-level example. Dragonflies, he noted, seek out their prey much as a guided missile seeks out its target. One could note the similarities in orientation via sound between human-made submarines and whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what happens in the on-board computer? Dawkins thinks that a key component in developing neo-purposes is the ability to simulate, to predict future outcomes under conditions other than what currently apply, and to be able to imagine novel situations. This raises further questions. Are whales conscious of their purposes? Dawkins relates that it seems that one can doubt that very simple animals have that sort of consciousness, but that it seems very likely that whales do have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of flexibility in determining behavior that a simulating, imaginative brain gives an animal, said Dawkins, makes for a double-edged sword. With flexibility comes the ability to subvert the adaptive archi-purpose underlying the brain’s functionality. Why do humans seek hedonistic pleasure? Why do humans not work more diligently at propagating their genes? It is the nature of brain flexibility that makes subversion of that archi-purpose possible, such that re-programming of the brain can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we know, said Dawkins, that there is both flexibility and inflexibility involved. The flexibility to set a new goal, a neo-purpose, can be coupled with the inflexible drive to pursue that goal that was originally part of the adaptive archi-purpose program. The new, neo-purpose, goal can be pursued over long periods, even a lifetime, in service of religious, military, or political ideas. There can be continued flexibility in setting up sub-goals, and sub-sub-goals, in service of the inflexibly held neo-purpose goal. It is important to understand this hierarchy of goal-seeking, and the capacity to set short-term goals in service of long-term goals. Humans provide the most obvious examples of subversion of goals. Humans bred sheepdogs for herding sheep, yet what one sees in the herding behavior is an altered or reprogrammed version of the stalking behavior of wolves. To take a fictional example, Dawkins used the movie, “The Bridge Over the River Kwai” and the character of Colonel Nicholson, whose obsession with proving the industry and ingenuity of the Western mindset subverted the goal of firmly opposing the war efforts of the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins named a number of archi-purposes that provided “subversion fodder”: hunger, sex, parental care, kinship, filial obedience, and others. We evolved under conditions where sugar and fat marked high-quality food sources, and poor food availability meant we tended to eat obsessively when food sources were available. But today for western culture, food is always available, and we do damage to our teeth and our health via over-indulgence. For the subversion of sex, Dawkins showed a photograph of a moose mounting a statue of a bison. Once the audience had gotten a laugh out of that, the next slide showed a scantily clad human female model, and Dawkins said, “At least the bison statue was in 3D.” Contraception forms a subversion of the archi-purpose of sex. Notes Steven Pinker’s quote, “My genes can go jump in the lake.” We adopt kittens and puppies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filial obedience is subverted as in “God the father”, and the elevation of other father-figures. Subversion of kinship occurs, too, we are keenly aware of our kin relations, and may be said to be obsessed with kinship. This subversion occurs via fictive kin, subverting kinship loyalty. In-group loyalty and out-group hostility utilize fictive kin to cement those new allegiances. Religion consistently uses fictive kin rhetoric. Entire nations can be viewed as using fictive kin relationships. This is especially dangerous when an implacable faith is involved, as the 9/11 terrorists demonstrated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a good side to the subversion of purpose. It can be exhilarating. Our species is likely young in its liberation from the strictures of archi-purposes. The steps from the invention of the wheel to that of airliners and space shuttles have proceeded rapidly. Cultural evolution is speedy, whether we pursue things beneficial or the sub-goals of war. But the flexibility we have gives us grounds for hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question and answer session followed after the lecture. The questions were submitted by the audience and selected by Prof. Dyer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question asked about Dawkins’ personal history of non-belief. He said he first started doubting religion at the age of nine, when he realized that there were lots of different religions. He completely lost faith at the age of fifteen, when he learned about Darwinian evolution and was able to attribute life and its history to something other than a designer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would you respond to those who compare you to the likes of Billy Graham; do you consider yourself an evangelical atheist? No, Dawkins said, he did not consider himself an evangelical atheist, for the reason that people like Billy Graham are absolutely sure that they are right, and he is not certain that he is right, and would be able to change his mind given sufficient evidence that he was wrong. Dawkins said that he was not dogmatic, therefore not an evangelical atheist. While the pattern of speech that he employs based on conviction may sound similar to that of Billy Graham, but he bases his conviction on evidence and should not be confused with conviction that proceeds from no evidence at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could someone embrace a no-god view without learning for themselves what science says about the world? Dawkins thought it would be difficult. He presumes that he would have been religious if he had been born before 1859, as the appearance of design is convincing. But even without the later scientific knowledge, one cannot come to a conclusion of a designer with any good certainty, as was recognized by various thinkers before Darwin, notably David Hume. So it would have been possible, but it would have been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the tendency in our society to embrace medicine based on pseudoscience? Dawkins said he was not dogmatically opposed to “alternative medicine”, as if one could demonstrate that some “alternative” works, it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes mainstream. That said, it is difficult to imagine a test for something like homeopathy, where active ingredients supposedly become more powerful with dilution. Eventually, both your control and your test dose contain nothing of the supposed active ingredient, thus if you found a difference, you would also have found entirely new laws of physics, too. Of course, the placebo effect exists, and mainstream doctors don’t have time to spend with patients, but alternative medicine doctors do. That additional time may be effective, but that effectiveness needs to be separated from the effect of the process or medication that the alternative practitioners offer. If we go back far enough, we may see our preference for alternative medicine in the fact that at one time what mainstream doctors mostly did was kill you, and while the alternative medicine practitioners may not have made you better, they at least mostly did nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the view that medicine extends life to many who would otherwise have died? Certainly modern medicine allows the human population to propagate many genes that contribute to genetic illness, but Dawkins does not see this as a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if instead of consider archi-purpose to be subverted that we view the ability to set neo-purposes as adaptive? Dawkins said that this was interesting and would go to his points about flexibility in brains as on-board computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an archi-purpose for spiritual experience? Dawkins said that the capability for spiritual experience could have a biological purpose, but that we should be careful to note that this did not mean that gods existed. Delusion is commonplace, and the survival value of the predisposition to spiritual experience could lead to the worship of nonexistent entities. The most likely way this might manifest is in a biological predisposition to a psychological attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins has said that he’d be honored to become a fossil. What does he see as the best thing that he will leave behind? Dawkins said that it would likely be &lt;em&gt;The Selfish Gene&lt;/em&gt;, though more recently he has preferred &lt;em&gt;The Ancestor’s Tale&lt;/em&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;The Blind Watchmaker&lt;/em&gt; is extremely popular, he sees &lt;em&gt;Climbing Mount Improbable&lt;/em&gt; as a better book addressing much the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your favorite novel? Dawkins said that he was devoted to P.G. Wodehouse, but loved the works of Evelyn Waugh.&lt;/p&gt;

He was kept imprisoned in a cage, and his response was to throw rocks at his obnoxious captors. He'd scavenge the prison yard at night for whatever loose stones he could find, and he'd cache them for the morning. When there weren't enough rocks, he'd pound the concrete retaining wall to knock loose chips of stone. Then when the jailers would show up, zip, zip, zip, a rain of stones on them. You have to respect that kind of defiance and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santino is a tough guy. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/mar/09/chimp-zoo-stones-science"&gt;Santino is also a chimpanzee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn't that make you wonder a bit? Chimpanzees &lt;i&gt;fight back&lt;/i&gt; at being caged, and they do so with forethought and resourcefulness. I imagine our ancestors felt the same way at every obstacle to their life, from marauding leopards to bad weather, and they stoked a bit of rage to fight back (which was probably ineffective in dealing with a thunderstorm, requiring slightly cleverer strategies). It's a start; it's a way of using your brain to resist, and I think it's a very human approach to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the story does not have a happy ending, and this also tells us something about modern humanity. Santino was not a placid clown for the crowds, so his keepers fixed him: Santino has been castrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think they should have taught him how to use an AK-47 and turned him loose in his native habitat to instruct his brothers and sisters in better ways to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/on_being_human.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/_W44VcRvHLA" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236691838623"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/we_are_growing.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3444b36dbd2c6137</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">We are growing!</title><published>2009-03-10T13:04:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T13:04:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/Xap-7xlXyVs/we_are_growing.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/we_are_growing.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's a sense of glee in the American atheist community over the &lt;a href="http://www.americanreligionsurvey-aris.org/"&gt;results of a recent survey&lt;/a&gt;: religion is in decline. As the site summarizes, "Only 1.6 percent of Americans call themselves atheist or agnostic. But based on stated beliefs, 12 percent are atheist (no God) or agnostic (unsure), while 12 percent more are deistic (believe in a higher power but not a personal God). The number of outright atheists has nearly doubled since 2001, from 900 thousand to 1.6 million. Twenty-seven percent of Americans do not expect a religious funeral at their death." The "New Atheist" approach is working, and more people are coming out of the dark closet of faith and standing in the light.&lt;/p&gt;

No surprise there - it was highly anticipated that he would remove Bush’s ban on federal funding for such research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama, however, decided to sweeten the deal by adding a memorandum regarding science in general. He wants to shield the scientific process from ideological intrusion. This is a very good thing - a principle with which I heartily agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harold Varmus, who co-chairs Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, is &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/08/AR2009030801476.html"&gt;quoted as saying: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We view what happened with stem cell research in the last administration as one manifestation of failure to think carefully about how federal support of science and the use of scientific advice occurs,” Varmus said. “This is consistent with the president’s determination to use sound scientific practice, responsible practice of science and evidence, instead of dogma in developing federal policy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama and his advisors have shown that they understand science only works when it is free from outside influence designed to bias the findings or operation of science. If science is subjugated to ideology or politics, it ceases to be science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know that the Obama administration will talk the talk of science - that’s good. But the real tests are yet to come. It remains to be seen if he will walk the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to decry the abuses of science by one’s ideological foes - we all do this. We know that the Obama administration will criticize and correct where possible abuses of science by conservatives in the past. These include embryonic stem cells, the denial of man-made global warming, reliance upon abstinence-only sex education, and obstruction of the Plan-B over-the-counter “morning after” pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real test will come when science conflicts with liberal ideology. The biggest issue I see here is that of so-called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Already Tom Harkin, a fellow Democrat, is trying to use Obama’s health care initiative to increase the integration of unscientific CAM into science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=489"&gt;I discussed last week&lt;/a&gt;, Harkin’s agenda is about as unscientific and ideologically driven as you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideology also trumps science when it comes to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). I and others have called upon Obama to disband this organization. The research they fund is either useless to science, serving only to promote CAM, or it can easily be funded by another center within the NIH. The political purpose of NCCAM is to create a double standard for CAM and to promote CAM - not to do good science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Obama is serious about putting science first then he will need to also take on those unscientific  programs and beliefs that are popular with Democrats. (As a side note, CAM proponents often find support also among anti-regulation libertarian Republicans, but this does not lessen the point that it is also popular among many Democrats.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other issues as well, many having to do with energy. This includes traditional Democratic opposition to nuclear power. It seems this has been weakening with the spike in oil prices last year, but we will see how this plays out.  Subsidies for corn-based bio-fuel are also scientifically dubious but politically popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong - I think that Obama’s dedication to untainted science is real and he deserves credit for this. He clearly wants to send this signal with the memo he is attaching to his lifting of the Bush ESC ban.  I am only pointing out that so far this principle has only been applied to opposing conservative positions. We have yet to see if his dedication to science will hold when traditionaly liberal positions are in the cross-hairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve never been a fan of that model myself. I’ve started two internet companies now, with a total of four different products. One of them (the most successful at the moment) uses what is known as the “freemium” business model, letting customers use the product for free and then selling them some other things optionally. The other three all charge everyone (though in all three, the fee is hidden as part of another transaction, similar to a poker room, which is still my favorite business model). All three are still around, in various degrees of repair, and two of them are rather old by internet standards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one shrewd angel once told me, only 100 companies can get into the Alexa Top 100. A lot of people say things like “no company that gets enough users goes out of business” which is true if you set the bar high enough, but largely only because VC funding and acquisitions have propped them up. Without Google’s bucks (or those of another similarly large acquirer) I’m highly skeptical YouTube would exist in its current form, even discounting the settlements and litigation fees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question people ask is “if that’s so, why don’t those companies go under?” There are two answers. One is that they do. Where’s broadcast.com now? It got bought and later shut down. They had a pretty tremendous share of traffic back in their day. Lots of dotcoms that didn’t charge (and plenty that did too) got a ton of customers and failed to make money. Anyone who was paying attention 8 years ago could rattle off a dozen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other answer is that the internet has only really been in business for 10-15 years, and it’s spent all but a few of them buoyed up by irrational exuberance. Even if you assumed it to be true that at some point we’d discover that making something people want wasn’t the only thing you have to do, you wouldn’t expect to have done so yet. It’s too early, and when people first started saying repeating that mantra it was way too early.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHH says the days of giving things away are numbered, and I tend to agree. There’s a simple cause and effect chain that led to a lot of free websites, and it’s pretty easy to see how it will unravel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Founders adopt that business model because it’s attractive to investors and helps them raise funds. Everyone wants to own a chunk of the next Google, and Google is free. In fact the vast majority of the Alexa Top 100 is free.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. VCs and angels are attracted to the ad-supported model because a high percentage of the companies that get acquired for the big bucks (like YouTube or MySpace) or even some that IPO (Google, Yahoo) use it. The reverse is not true though, as there are probably 1000 startups that set out to make the top 100 for every one that succeeds, but it’s a very common logical fallacy to assume that it is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. While IPOs are pretty much dead, big companies acquire startups for two reasons. One is that the founders have a lot of talent, in which case it really doesn’t matter what their business model is. Google doesn’t need a business model, it needs great employees (or at least it did). These are generally small purchases that investors often dislike because they don’t get much return.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is that it has a lot of users that the acquirer feels it could monetize. YouTube fits into that category. The acquisitions of these types of companies will stop when acquirers start having to shut down startups they paid millions or billions for and couldn’t manage to turn a profit on. Some will be forced to out of economic necessity, and even the Googles of the world that could afford to subsidize a lot of crappy products indefinitely won’t. And every time they’re forced shut down some crap like Broadcast.com, they’ll think even harder about the next Skype.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recession is the straw that has broken the camel’s back. The third domino is already falling, and it might take a short while for the other two to be knocked over in turn, but it will happen. High volume, ad-supported web businesses will always exist, because in certain areas (search for instance) they just make sense, but they’ll cease to be the sole aspiration for the vast majority of internet startups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matt</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/mattmaroon/AAcm</id><title type="html">MattMaroon.com</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236675233037"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=385">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cedd95f24de0ee55</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Book Review"/><category term="Cancer"/><category term="Nutrition"/><category term="Diet"/><category term="heart disease"/><category term="low protein diet"/><category term="nutrition. animal protein"/><category term="prevention"/><category term="T.

Colin Campbell, PhD, with his non-scientist son Thomas M. Campbell II. The China Study was an epidemiologic survey of diet and health conducted in villages throughout China and is touted as “the most comprehensive study of nutrition ever conducted.” The book’s major thesis is that we could prevent or cure most disease (heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, bone, kidney, eye and other diseases) by eating a whole foods plant-based diet, drastically reducing our protein intake, and avoiding meat and dairy products entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opinions of the book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of praise for this book on the Internet. It was named VegNews Book of the Year. PETA loves it (not surprisingly). Heather Mills McCartney calls it inspirational. It was &lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahandfriends/moz/moz_20070705"&gt;featured on Oprah.com&lt;/a&gt; and endorsed by two of her favorite doctors: Mehmet Oz and Dean Ornish. Its author was even interviewed on Coast to Coast AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also found &lt;a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/bookreviews/chinastudy.html"&gt;this critical review &lt;/a&gt;which makes some excellent points and accuses the authors of misrepresenting the findings of the study. And &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Colin-Campbell-Doesnt-China-Study/forum/Fx1YJPR95OHW08P/Tx3QD9DFF9KLKFN/1/ref=cm_cd_dp_tft_tp?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;asin=1932100660&amp;amp;store=books"&gt;this commenter &lt;/a&gt;on an Amazon.com forum also charges Campbell with misrepresenting the data from the study and points out numerous flaws in his reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problematic references&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t look at the praise or criticism of others until after I read the book, and the following represents my independent impressions. I approached the book as I do any book with scientific references: I read until I come across a statement of fact that strikes me as questionable and then I check the references given for the statement. This immediately got me off on the wrong foot with this book. In the first chapter I found the statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease can be prevented and even reversed by a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end notes listed 2 references in support of this assertion. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1973470?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;The first reference&lt;/a&gt; was not about diet alone, but about a combination of several lifestyle interventions (Dean Ornish’s intensive program). 28 patients were assigned to an experimental group (low-fat vegetarian diet, stopping smoking, stress management training, and moderate exercise) and 20 to a usual-care control group. The experimental group had less artery narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7500065"&gt;The second&lt;/a&gt; was a study of 22 patients with severe heart disease in a single physician’s practice. Their disease was arrested or reversed over a 5-year period not by diet alone but with a combination of a very low fat diet and cholesterol-lowering drugs. These studies were published in 1990 and 1995 respectively and as far as I know have not been replicated. And they were small preliminary studies of the kind that should be used only to guide further research, not the kind of definitive studies that can be used to guide clinical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither reference supports the claim that diet (by itself) can reverse heart disease and neither of them has anything to do with preventing heart disease – all the subjects in both studies already had the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading further, I found that this was not an isolated oversight, but part of a pattern. For instance, Campbell asserts that diet is an effective treatment for melanoma and supports that claim by citing a Tijuana study of the discredited &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/cancer.html"&gt;Gerson protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which includes coffee enemas and other non-dietary interventions. Patients allegedly cured of cancer by this method were tracked down by a naturopath who found that 5 years later all but one had died of their cancer and the only one still alive was not cancer free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually there are a couple of more credible references listed on PubMed suggesting that a low-fat diet might be beneficial for melanoma. Why did the author not cite those studies but pick a disreputable one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sloppy citations like these do not disprove the author’s thesis, but they throw doubt on his scientific rigor and reasoning abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The China Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The China Study involved 100 adults in each of 65 counties in China. Only those between the ages of 35 and 64 were studied; for mortality rates they eliminated death certificates of those over the age of 64 as “unreliable.” They pooled blood samples from everyone in a village so they would have large enough samples to measure over 109 nutritional, viral, hormonal and other indicators in blood. They also measured 24 urinary factors, mortality rates for more than 48 diseases, 36 food constituents, 36 nutrient and food intakes, 60 diet and lifestyle factors, and 17 geographic and climatic factors. All in all, they studied 367 variables and made 8000 correlations. I’ll leave it to others to comment on the study design and the statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese eat far less animal protein than Americans and far less total protein than even American vegetarians. They eat more calories per kilo of body weight than Americans, apparently without weight gain even among the subset of Chinese who were least physically active (Campbell attributes this to thermogenesis from carbohydrate metabolism as compared to protein metabolism, and he claims that vegetarians feel more energetic and naturally exercise more, using up extra calories). They found that Chinese cholesterol levels are far lower than Western levels and decline as the amount of protein in the diet declines. They found a strong dose-effect relationship between the amount of animal protein in the diet and the rates of many diseases like heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a number of studies in PubMed that reached very different conclusions. I’ll quote from &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19166134?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;one typical example &lt;/a&gt;and provide links to a couple of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetarians form a non-homogenous group consisting of semivegetarians (plant food, dairy products, eggs and fish), lacto-ovo vegetarians (plant food, dairy products, eggs) and vegans (plant food only). According to pure vegetarian ideologists, people consuming vegetarian diet have better health and live longer than nonvegetarians, because persons consuming milk, dairy products, meat, eggs and fish are at health risk.In fact the most healthy people in Europe are inhabitants of Iceland, Switzerland and Scandinavia, consuming great amounts of food of animal origin. Meta-analysis of several prospective studies showed no significant differences in the mortality caused by colorectal, stomach, lung, prostate or breast cancers and stroke between vegetarians and “health-conscious” nonvegetarians. In vegetarians, a decrease of ischemic heart disease mortality was observed probably due to lower total serum cholesterol levels, lower prevalence of obesity and higher consumption of antioxidants. Very probably, an ample consumption of fruits and vegetables and not the exclusion of meat make vegetarians healthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441942?ordinalpos=2&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt; this one&lt;/a&gt; And &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10479225?ordinalpos=6&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell criticizes all Western studies of low-fat and low-protein diets because the Western versions of those diets still have far more fat and protein than the average diet in China. The Nurse’s Health Study found no connection between breast cancer and the amount of fat in the diet, but Campbell points out that it really only compared carnivorous nurses to slightly less carnivorous nurses. The “low-fat” group was still eating a very high-fat diet by Chinese standards. This is a very valid criticism, and it also applies to the relatively ineffective Western efforts to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease with diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations from other countries tend to contradict the correlations found in China. The African Maasai eat a diet high in animal protein (meat, milk and blood from their cows) – yet they have low blood cholesterol levels and low rates of heart disease. Among the Eskimos (who ate an animal-based, very high protein, high fat diet) heart disease was practically unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell doesn’t attempt to explain a glaring exception to his data: stomach cancer rates are higher in China than elsewhere in the world – he doesn’t even mention that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cites all kinds of research to support his hypothesis that animal protein is bad. Toxins like aflatoxin and nitrosamine cause rats and mice to develop cancers, but carcinogenesis is prevented by feeding them a low protein diet. Casein (one specific animal protein in milk) has been linked to some human diseases. Links between fat, animal protein, vitamin D and other nutrients confuse the issue. The incidence of many diseases varies with latitude – is it the difference in sun exposure, the blood levels of vitamin D, the fact that people at higher latitudes eat more fat, that they eat more meat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He marshals a lot of evidence, but is it sufficient to support his recommendation that everyone give up animal protein entirely, including dairy products? I don’t think so. There are legitimate concerns that such a diet may not be without risks. Even Campbell recognizes that strict vegetarians are likely to need vitamin B12 supplementation. If cow’s milk is prohibited for growing children and osteoporotic adults, they will likely need a supplemental source of calcium and vitamin D. Without careful nutrition guidance, children deprived of milk might end up malnourished. Breast milk is animal protein – should we avoid breast-feeding too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He criticizes conventional recommendations for a diet with 45-65% of calories from carbohydrates, 20-35% from fat and 10-35% from protein, showing how the following menu satisfies those requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast&lt;br&gt;
1 cup Froot Loops&lt;br&gt;
1 cup skim milk&lt;br&gt;
1 package M&amp;amp;M milk chocolate candies&lt;br&gt;
Fiber and vitamin supplements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch&lt;br&gt;
Grilled cheddar cheeseburger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinner&lt;br&gt;
3 slices pepperoni pizza&lt;br&gt;
16 oz soda&lt;br&gt;
1 serving Archway sugar cookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s a bit of a straw man argument. In reality, most current nutritional advice makes very much the same recommendations Campbell does except for his strict prohibition of animal protein. For instance, for cancer prevention the &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MED/content/MED_2_1X_American_Cancer_Society_guidelines_on_diet_and_cancer_prevention.asp"&gt;American Cancer Society recommends &lt;/a&gt;a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes and low in red meat and alcohol, along with regular exercise and weight control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for proponents of the low-carb diet fad for weight loss, almost everything I have read recently in the way of diet advice is consistent with the ACS recommendations. More veggies, less red meat, fewer calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be wonderful if we could prevent cancer and all those other diseases by avoiding animal protein. It would have the extra added benefit to the environment of increasing the productivity of agricultural land and reducing the greenhouse effects of gassy cows. I look forward to future well-designed studies investigating the effects of very low protein and animal-protein-free diets. Meanwhile, The China Study makes a good case, but the case isn’t quite good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

David Walker, the attorney for &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/should_wendy_portillo_still_be_teaching"&gt;Wendy Portillo&lt;/a&gt;---the Florida teacher who had her kindergarten students &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/different_you_dont_have_our_vote"&gt;vote out fellow student Alex Barton&lt;/a&gt; in May of last year---has filed closing arguments. You can find the &lt;a href="http://www.doah.state.fl.us/docdoc/2008/005947/08005947M-030609-13494549.PDF"&gt;PDF file&lt;/a&gt; to read &lt;a href="http://www.doah.state.fl.us/docdoc/2008/005947/08005947M-030609-13494549.PDF"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and documents for &lt;a href="http://www.doah.state.fl.us/internet/search/docket.cfm?RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;CaseNo=08-005947&amp;amp;Petitioner=ST%2E%20LUCIE%20COUNTY%20SCHOOL%20BOARD&amp;amp;Respondent=WENDY%20PORTILLO&amp;amp;URLString=Count%3D1%26BPCount%3D1%26DWH%3D1%26Res%3Dportillo"&gt;St. Lucie County School Board vs. Wendy Portillo&lt;/a&gt; can all be accessed &lt;a href="http://www.doah.state.fl.us/internet/search/docket.cfm?RequestTimeout=500&amp;amp;CaseNo=08-005947&amp;amp;Petitioner=ST%2E%20LUCIE%20COUNTY%20SCHOOL%20BOARD&amp;amp;Respondent=WENDY%20PORTILLO&amp;amp;URLString=Count%3D1%26BPCount%3D1%26DWH%3D1%26Res%3Dportillo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Portillo's attorney argues the May 21, 2008, incident is not grounds for her being suspended for one year and losing her contract status, and that that her "effectiveness" as a teacher was not impaired by her "alleged misconduct."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portillo's lawyer argues that she should be able to return to "employment with back pay from the date of suspension without pay." It is noted that, while Superintendent Michael Lannon has said that she "was not qualified to teach the children she had been teaching at Morningside Elementary School," there was "no testimony" stating that she "was and could not teach in the St. Lucie County School System." According to her lawyer, the claim that Portillo's "alleged misconduct was so serious" as to "impair her effectiveness in the school system" was not proven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portillo's lawyer also seeks to downplay Portillo's having the students "vote out" Alex by arguing that, in the case against her, too much emphasis was placed on a separate communication from a parent after the May 21st incident, and on the publicity ("alleged notoriety") of the incident.  Certainly there was a great deal of attention in the national media about Alex's expulsion from Portillo's class, with many (myself included) puzzling over a teacher, and a teacher of kindergarteners, having her students "vote out" one of their fellow students----a measure that seemed modeled more after the TV show "Survivor" than any kind of pedagogical best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Portllio's lawyer argues that his client's "alleged misconduct" does not "[speak] for itself as it relates to the serious loss of effectiveness"----that Portillo's actions in her classroom were not, to any observer relying on common sense, simply inappropriate. Petillo's lawyer cites two cases (Purvis vs. Marion County School Board and Walker vs. Highlands County School Board)  as examples in which there was an "alleged loss of serious effectiveness" on the part of a teacher. The case detailed (that of &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Walker&lt;/span&gt;) is so different from the case of Portillo that it does not contribute to the case being made for her not having "impaired effectiveness" in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Walker&lt;/span&gt;, an "outrageous" and "joking" remark regarding "cigarattes, drugs, among other things" is cited:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class in which the remarks were made consisted of twenty six students all of whom went out of control. Two or [sic] students left the class to report a theft. Two others were [sic] out of the class searching for stolen property. One student was intoxicated so that it would require two adult staff members to carry him from the classroom. Two other students were attempting to hide contraband in the dark room. One student hid a look a like drug in a trash can and another student testified that everyone in the class was going to the bathroom. Further no lesson was presented that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of conduct referred to in Walker is clearly distinguishable from the incident of May 21, 2008. The incident of May 21, 2008 was albeit questionable, orderly, there was no riot, none of the students were injured, the Respondent did not lose control of the classroom and the matter was handled appropriately including an apology by the Respondent to CAB's mother &lt;em&gt;[regarding this last point, please see statements from &lt;a href="http://www.cbs12.com/news/portillo_4714017___article.html/teacher_months.html"&gt;cbs12.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To compare the &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Walker&lt;/span&gt; case to what happened in Portillo's classroom in May is to compare the proverbial apples and oranges. The students in Portillo's classroom were kindergarteners and, while no students were physically "injured," the exclusion of one student---based on his student peers "voting" on him remaining in the class or not---may well have emotional and other consequences not only on Alex, the student "voted out," but on the other students who were asked to engage in such a "questionable" activity, in an educational setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is meant by "effectiveness in the school system" is not clearly articulated in the statement from Portillo's lawyer. If "effectiveness" refers to how well Portillo performed her job as a teacher, one should wonder about what exactly Portillo was teaching her class of kindergarteners that day in May of 2008 when she had them "vote out" one of their fellow students, Alex Barton: To cast out those who do not "fit in" and without further examination of why this is the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something was certainly taught at Morningside Elementary School on May 21, 2008. The question is, is this the kind of lesson---about how we interact with those who are different, about how those who are the authorities model justice and compassion---- to be teaching our children today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team of scientists is funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and led by Dr Mike Modo of the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London. The work, carried out at the Institute of Psychiatry and University of Nottingham, shows that by inserting tiny scaffolding with stem cells attached, it is possible to fill a hole left by stroke damage with brand new brain tissue within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 7 days! How fitting.&lt;/p&gt;

After only a month in office, I know that myself and many like-minded individuals criticized Obama for numerous decisions that we disagreed with him on. The obvious examples that come to mind are his continuation of Bush’s faith-based initiatives and his poor judgment in picking Rick Warren to speak at his inauguration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are far bigger concerns than this and Obama has in my opinion scored a solid A- so far in his running of the country, still better than any other president in my lifetime. But even though I won’t always agree with his every policy decision, one thing is very, very clear. Barack Obama, contrary to certain previous 21st century U.S. presidents whose names I’ll keep anonymous, is a smart man. Also he’s a man who has an above average understanding of science and understanding of why promoting good science is vital to the health of the nation and to the entire human species. That was evident from his science cabinet appointments and in the bill he signed today lifting the Bush ban on government funding for embryonic stem cell research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why today was a good day for science and a good day for America. And though I’d rather Obama hadn’t trashed cloning in this speech, I hope that this is the Barack Obama we’ll continue to see for the next 4 or more years.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other "based on true story" films that are worthy of comment, however.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236661817504"><id gr:original-id="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/?p=2458">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ec8d51a1145f114c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="atheism"/><category term="religion"/><category term="American Religious Identification Survey"/><category term="atheists"/><category term="United States"/><title type="html">U.S.: atheists rising, religious falling</title><published>2009-03-10T05:07:39Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T05:07:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/2009/03/09/us-atheists-rising-religious-falling/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepacabra.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-03-09-american-religion-ARIS_N.htm"&gt;suggests that religion is losing ground in the U.S. while the number of atheists and those unaffiliated with any religion are rapidly rising in every state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, I think, is further vindication that those who have been taking a more aggressive approach in promoting atheism and critical thinking in recent years, such as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Daniel Dennett, among many others–have been changing minds despite the insistence of critics even within the atheist “community” that they’ve only turned more people off to atheism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information regarding the statistics outlined in the new study can be found by clicking the link above. But here are some of the key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Catholic strongholds in New England and the Midwest have faded as immigrants, retirees and young job-seekers have moved to the Sun Belt. While bishops from the Midwest to Massachusetts close down or consolidate historic parishes, those in the South are scrambling to serve increasing numbers of worshipers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Baptists, 15.8% of those surveyed, are down from 19.3% in 1990. Mainline Protestant denominations, once socially dominant, have seen sharp declines: The percentage of Methodists, for example, dropped from 8% to 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• The percentage of those who choose a generic label, calling themselves simply Christian, Protestant, non-denominational, evangelical or “born again,” was 14.2%, about the same as in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Jewish numbers showed a steady decline, from 1.8% in 1990 to 1.2% today. The percentage of Muslims, while still slim, has doubled, from 0.3% to 0.6%. Analysts within both groups suggest those numbers understate the groups’ populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ihsan Bagby, associate professor of Islamic studies at the University of Kentucky-Lexington, says that most national telephone surveys such as ARIS undercount Muslims, and that he is conducting a study of mosques’ membership sponsored by the Hartford (Conn.) Institute for Religious Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, some Jewish surveys that report larger numbers of Jews also include “cultural” Jews — those who connect to Judiasm through its traditions, but not necessarily through actively practicing the religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, nearly 2.8 million people now identify with dozens of new religious movements, calling themselves Wiccan, pagan or “Spiritualist,” which the survey does not define.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So a skill requires  conceptual and cultural skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apes, they found, manufactured special “brush sticks” in the knowledge that more termites would hook onto this form of the probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brush stick was four times more likely to result in a catch, and the average haul was 4.9 termites compared with 0.27 termites with the unmodified stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are important, says the study. It seems that chimpanzees, like humans, are able to conceptualise what they want to do — and tool making is a cultural achievement, learnt or copied from others, and not something innate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our results indicate that chimpanzees have a mental template of the tool form, which is employed in crafting the tool prior to use and refining it during use,” says the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now given that $cientology has lots of front groups to indoctrinate people like their bogus drug rehabilitation program, Narconon, this isn’t very surprising. But the problem is that they’re receiving federal tax dollors for allegedly secular lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics who lodged four complaints last year against the nonprofit —- which uses Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s teachings —- wrote they feared it wouldn’t keep ideology out of the classroom. 		&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State education officials began an annual inspection in February and will observe the group’s tutoring this month. The review will include making sure Applied Scholastics’ policies and teachings are geared toward secular instruction, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now who was the moron who let the cat out of the bag about the inspection? Doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose? it’s been known for some time that Applied Scholastics was just a recruiting ground for $cientology. This information has been leaked by $cientology insiders who’ve escaped the cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that $cientology knows there’s going to be an inspection, wouldn’t they have to be monumentally stupid to not put their house in order and take the proper steps the hide evidence of their true agenda at Applied Scholastics? Unfortunately, they’re not stupid. For this reason, I’m not expecting much or anything to come from this month’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, March 14th is Anonymous Global Protest Day in front of the $cientology Centers in all major cities around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please allow me to share with you how “The Secret” changed my life and in a very real and substantive way allowed me to overcome a severe crisis in my personal life. It is well known that the premise of “The Secret” is the science of attracting the things in life that you desire and need and in removing from your life those things that you don’t want. Before finding this book, I knew nothing of these principles, the process of positive visualization, and had actually engaged in reckless behaviors to the point of endangering my own life and wellbeing.&lt;br&gt;
At age 36, I found myself in a medium security prison serving 3-5 years for destruction of government property and public intoxication. This was stiff punishment for drunkenly defecating in a mailbox but as the judge pointed out, this was my third conviction for the exact same crime. I obviously had an alcohol problem and a deep and intense disrespect for the postal system, but even more importantly I was ignoring the very fabric of our metaphysical reality and inviting destructive influences into my life.&lt;br&gt;
My fourth day in prison was the first day that I was allowed in general population and while in the recreation yard I was approached by a prisoner named Marcus who calmly informed me that as a new prisoner I had been purchased by him for three packs of Winston cigarettes and 8 ounces of Pruno (prison wine). Marcus elaborated further that I could expect to be raped by him on a daily basis and that I had pretty eyes.&lt;br&gt;
Needless to say, I was deeply shocked that my life had sunk to this level. Although I’ve never been homophobic I was discovering that I was very rape phobic and dismayed by my overall personal street value of roughly $15. I returned to my cell and sat very quietly, searching myself for answers on how I could improve my life and distance myself from harmful outside influences. At that point, in what I consider to be a miraculous moment, my cell mate Jim Norton informed me that he knew about the Marcus situation and that he had something that could solve my problems. He handed me a copy of “The Secret”. Normally I wouldn’t have turned to a self help book to resolve such a severe and immediate threat but I literally didn’t have any other available alternatives. I immediately opened the book and began to read.&lt;br&gt;
The first few chapters deal with the essence of something called the “Law of Attraction” in which a primal universal force is available to us and can be harnessed for the betterment of our lives. The theoretical nature of the first few chapters wasn’t exactly putting me at peace. In fact, I had never meditated and had great difficulty with closing out the chaotic noises of the prison and visualizing the positive changes that I so dearly needed. It was when I reached Chapter 6 “The Secret to Relationships” that I realized how this book could help me distance myself from Marcus and his negative intentions. Starting with chapter six there was a cavity carved into the book and in that cavity was a prison shiv. This particular shiv was a toothbrush with a handle that had been repeatedly melted and ground into a razor sharp point.&lt;br&gt;
The next day in the exercise yard I carried “The Secret” with me and when Marcus approached me I opened the book and stabbed him in the neck. The next eight weeks in solitary confinement provided ample time to practice positive visualization and the 16 hours per day of absolute darkness made visualization about the only thing that I actually could do. I’m not sure that everybody’s life will be changed in such a dramatic way by this book but I’m very thankful to have found it and will continue to recommend it heartily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ari, you made my day. Thank you for that.&lt;/p&gt;

At the age of twelve I went to a religious summer camp by invitation of one of my Junior High school teachers. It was at this camp that I “accepted” Christ and first professed Christianity. I continued attending the Baptist mission until I was 17 when I realized that I was not living the Christian life that I professed. I then dedicated my life to being a consistent Christian and became intensely interested in theology.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this early stage of my life I went through a number of theological changes and transitions. I moved from dispensationalism to amillennialism, Arminianism to Calvinism and embraced the tenets of Landmarkism. For those interested Landmarkism is a branch of the Baptist family that sees itself as the true heirs not only of the Baptist faith, but of the apostolic faith. Landmarkism and Landmarkers believe they can trace their churches back through the centuries of Christian history back to the apostles.  They call it Baptist Church Succession or chain link successionism. This viewpoint was popular among Baptists of the 19th century but has many holdovers still today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was with the Landmark Baptists for about 20 years and even created a website dedicated to defending the basic ideas of Calvinistic Landmarkism. During this time my theological views continued to develop and change. My views of the church (and Landmarkism in general) began to moderate, so for example, I came to reject the chain link succession view and instead I embraced the concept of a “spiritual kinship.” I also rejected tithing which is very popular among most Baptists of all types. Although many of my theological views tended to moderate, some on the other hand became more hardened such as my Calvinism. I found the concepts preached by the Protestant Reformed Church and Gordon Clark very interesting and couldn’t deny their logic. I was drawn to their double predestinarianism, superlapsarianism, denial of the free offer of the gospel, and their emphasis on rationality and reasoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although I remained with the Landmarkers for 20 years it was during the last two to three of those years that I came to fully reject their views. Instead I embraced “house church” theology and ecclesiology as I found it to be very scriptural and aligned very well with the way many scholars conceived of the early church. The problem for me was that I could not find any house churches in my area that were Calvinistic as most were typically Arminian and Charismatic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around the year 2000 I had found a strong Calvinistc group that met in my area where the guy pastoring the group was sympathetic to many of the house church concepts. After some reluctance I finally visited the group and then joined them and remained with them for over 8 years. The thing that sets this group apart from the ones that I had been in contact with in the past was their emphasis on the work of Christ (understood from a strictly Calvinistic perspective) and the doctrine of Justification by imputed righteousness. For them these were the heart of the gospel message so much so that they denied a person was truly a Christian if they did not hold to them. They had no problem with the idea that all Arminians were lost and even traced their “true” conversion to the Christian faith to when they embraced these views. Any religious faith before then was defined as false religion holding to a false gospel. And yes, I did embrace these viewpoints as well because they made sense to me. Oddly enough it was during my time with this group that I also embraced evangelical egalitarianism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This should give you enough information about my theological background to give you an idea of where I came from and the direction of where I was headed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the things that I have always been very interested in since I first became theologically aware was Christian apologetics. I have read numerous books on different topics from young earth creationism, to the inerrancy and reliability of the Bible, to the existence of God and the resurrection of Christ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About two years ago I was studying a number of related topics: the historicity of the Old Testament, the creation account in Genesis, and the age of the cosmos. It was during these studies that the evidence for an ancient earth became so strong that I could no longer deny it. Of course this led to a number of questions related to Genesis, the flood, Adam and Eve, and creation and evolution. Having been taught young earth creationism all of my life this was quite shocking to me. This led to my restudying the historicity of the Old Testament, especially the early chapters of Genesis, and this in turn opened the whole question of biological origins. These studies and four books in particular are what led to my rejection of the Christian faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These four books changed my whole perspective on the Bible and biological origins so I want to briefly mention each one and some of the arguments that they contain. All are written by evangelical Christians who still hold to some form of conservative Christianity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first of the books was Peter Enns, &lt;i&gt;Inspiration and Incarnation: Evangelicals and the Problem of the Old Testament&lt;/i&gt;. Much of what Enns is saying corresponds to a lot of what other Old Testament scholars like Paul Seeley have been writing about: in order to understand the Old Testament we need to understand its background. The literature of the ancient near east has a huge impact on understanding and interpreting the Old Testament whether we are talking about the creation account, the Noahic flood, or the wisdom, or prophetic literature. There is also the amount of theological diversity within the Old Testament that can be found between the different authors, books, and time periods that are often contradictory. There is also the issue of how the New Testament authors understand and interpret the Old Testament using first century Jewish hermeneutical principles that we would reject today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next book that had a major impact on my thinking was &lt;i&gt;Coming to Peace with Science&lt;/i&gt; by Darrel R. Falk. This is the first pro-evolution book that I had ever read and once I finished it I was thoroughly convinced. Evolution is not what most Christians make it to be and the evidence for it is overwhelming. Some of the things that Falk brings up include the evidence for an ancient universe that can be accurately measured using radiometric dating. I had always been taught to not trust this dating method but Falk shows that we can indeed believe its results. The distribution of fossils in the fossil record corresponds to the evolution of life, from single celled organism, to multicellular life, to the vast array of life forms that we see today. There is the evidence of organisms with transitional features such as &lt;i&gt;Pakicetus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Archaeopyeryx&lt;/i&gt; and the various fossil series such as the whale and the horse series. There is also the evidence from the geographical distribution of life and DNA. And these are just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another book that clinched it for me in favor of evolution was Stephen Godfrey and Christopher Smith’s book &lt;i&gt;Paradigms on Pilgrimage: Creationism, Paleontology, and Biblical Interpretation&lt;/i&gt;. What Falk did for biology, these guys do for paleontology. The evidence of fossil footprints and various other types of trace fossils at various levels of sediment blow “flood geology” out of the water. The natural history of life that is recorded in the sediments is easily explained by evolution, but cannot be done by any form of creationism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fourth book was &lt;i&gt;God’s Word in Human Words: An Evangelical Appropriation of Critical Biblical Scholarship&lt;/i&gt; by Kenton Sparks. By the time that I read this one I had already rejected inerrancy and was looking for a way to still hold to the Bible as some form of God’s word. Sparks does want to maintain the inspiration of the Bible but most evangelicals would not agree with his explanation and besides the evidence he brings forth is just too overwhelming against it. It is simply a fact that most evangelical scholars do not deal seriously with biblical criticism and Sparks calls them on the carpet over and over again. Some of these critical problems include the close similarity of the ancient near eastern literature with the Old Testament which needs to be adequately assimilated by evangelical scholarship. There are serious problems with the Pentateuch such as authorship (it is pretty much a consensus that Moses did not write much, if any, of it), its chronology, theological diversity, and historicity. There are the questions of the historicity of Exodus, and more generally Israelite historiography. There are multiple issues with the prophets including their message, content and failed prophecies. Take Daniel for example, the evidence is that it was written around 175-164 BCE and that the four kingdoms prophesied where Babylon, Media, Persian, and Greece (and not the traditional Babylon, Medo-Persian, Greek and Rome) and that the author thought that the kingdom of God would break in to destroy Antiochus but that his prophecy failed. In the New Testament there is the issue of the liberty that the Gospel writers take in presenting their stories and the flawed hermeneutics used by the New Testament writers in general. Again, this is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time I finished reading the book by Sparks I sat down and realized that there was nothing left for me to believe. The overwhelming evidence for biological evolution, the natural history of the world, and the historical critical problems with the Bible left me dumb founded. I came to the conclusion that I was no longer a Christian and that I had to reject the faith that I had believed, loved and cherished for so long. I now consider myself an agnostic but am very suspicious that atheism is probably true and am leaning more and more in that direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am still very interested in things related to religion in general and Christianity in particular as it helps me to see where I was, where I am now and to be more equipped at discussing these things with Christians who are still locked into their false hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-6825389183865871671?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I wish I had known in time to write something for then, but I guess that’s OK. The point of the day is to raise awareness, and it made me think about a couple of issues. So let me talk to you about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women in science is a tough issue. They are still underrepresented, and I don’t think it’s clear why. Sexism, certainly, plays a role. In fact, it plays both ends of the age game: when young girls want to go into science, they can be discouraged by their teachers, and when they are older trying to get a job in science they can be discouraged by their peers. I’ve heard way too many stories about that, and read too many studies as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://thesuperficial.com/2009/03/jessica_simpson_wearing_daisy.php?bfm_index=3&amp;amp;bfm_page=0"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/jessicasimpson.jpg" alt="Jessica Simpson"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I wonder about sexism in a broader sense, too. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/04/model-scientists/"&gt;Our society in the US is not the most encouraging for women&lt;/a&gt;. Just look at the screwed up body image advertising and such gives women; Jessica Simpson has gained some weight recently and a lot of rags online have been calling her fat. Really? She looks like she has a healthy and normal body to me. This whole advertising trend of using women with the bodies of 12-year-old boys baffles me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there are worse places for women. Allow me a slight digression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Michelle Bachmann (R-MN) is batguano insane (&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=michelle+bachmann&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t"&gt;about a billion examples are to be found on the web&lt;/a&gt;, left as an exercise for the reader). Her viewpoints are so bizarre and skewed that her biography would have to be written on a Moebius strip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in a blog post about women’s rights, poking fun at Bachmann is ironic. Maybe so, but the point I want to make is that even a stopped clock is right twice a day. In an interview from 2008, tucked in with a vast number of ravings that are actually difficult to map against reality in any way, &lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/michelle-bachmann-so-much-apology"&gt;Bachmann said this:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not all cultures are equal. Not all values are equal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may shock people, but in this one small case I  agree with this lunatic. She’s absolutely right. All cultures are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; equal. A simple example: a large fraction of our own culture in the United States used to accept slavery. Moral equivalency be damned; slavery is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I would hesitate to accept anything as a moral absolute, there are some things that are clearly wrong. Murder. Slavery. Institutional torture. Genocide. Racism. Sexism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that last one brings us to the point. There are countries in this world where women are treated essentially as slaves, or, perhaps worse, as &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt;. Girls get acid thrown on their face for daring to get an education (and while this was done by a small band of militants, the Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan for years, forbad girls from going to school). &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/18/national/main4808738.shtml"&gt;A woman was beheaded&lt;/a&gt;, possibly as an honor killing because she wanted to divorce her husband. A google search yields so much more, a horrifying list of atrocities aimed against women. &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/01/08/png.witchcraft/index.html"&gt;A woman set afire&lt;/a&gt; because she was accused of being a witch. Thankfully &lt;a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/violence-against-women/page.do?id=1011012"&gt;there are groups taking action&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am something of a moral relativist; I know that cultures differ, and what is art in one place would be a grave insult in another. That’s OK, because people are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you take half your population and relegate it to second class, forbid them from learning, don’t let them participate fully in society, then there is no relativism in my book. You’re wrong, and you’re stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/carolyn_buzz3.jpg" alt="Carolyn Porco and Buzz Aldrin"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buzz Aldrin with Carolyn Porco, whom &lt;br&gt;he called &amp;quot;the Secretary General of &lt;br&gt;United Nations of the Solar System&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some brilliant women astronomers. Absolutely brilliant at what they do, whether it’s research, observing, public outreach, writing. Where would our science be without them? &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/index.php?js=1"&gt;Carolyn Porco&lt;/a&gt; leads the Cassini imaging team which has brought us such beauty from the deep solar system. Could a man have done that? Sure, but that’s not the point: a woman could do it, and &lt;strong&gt;did&lt;/strong&gt; do it. &lt;a href="http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/rubin/"&gt;Vera Rubin&lt;/a&gt; helped clinch the existence of dark matter. &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ghez/"&gt;Andrea Ghez&lt;/a&gt; has measured the mass of a black hole 25 quadrillion kilometers away, in the center of the Milky Way. &lt;a href="http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/~fischer/Welcome.html"&gt;Debra Fischer&lt;/a&gt; finds planets orbiting other stars. &lt;a href="http://www.starstryder.com/"&gt;Pamela Gay&lt;/a&gt; educates tens of thousands of people on Astronomy Cast. &lt;a href="http://thespacewriter.com/wp/"&gt;Carolyn Collins Petersen&lt;/a&gt; does the same by writing planetarium shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on, of course. These women — and many more — are friends, colleagues, scientists. Where we would be now if we relegated them to wearing burkas, to walking behind men, to staying at home and kept in the dark about the Universe around them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relativism be damned. Our culture in the US has a long way to go, certainly, but if you look behind us you’ll see the long winding road we’ve already labored upon. I’m glad my daughter is starting with such a head start down that road, and I hope that she forges ahead even further. That road goes a long way in both directions, and we’re right in the middle of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236648715943"><id gr:original-id="http://draust.wordpress.com/?p=460">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c768492256d70748</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">You couldn?t make it up</title><published>2009-03-10T00:12:03Z</published><updated>2009-03-10T00:12:03Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://draust.wordpress.com/2009/03/10/you-couldnt-make-it-up/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">A small round-up of what I have been reading.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, is that enough? &lt;a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/television/215400/doctor_who_skins_actress_for_new_companion.html"&gt;Den of Geek&lt;/a&gt; is spreading the rumor that the new companion for the new Doctor is a young lass named Hannah Murray. I’ve not heard of her, but she was on a BBC show called &lt;em&gt;Skins&lt;/em&gt;. She’s very young, 19, which come to think of it was how old Rose was supposed to be in the first series (Billie Piper was actually 23 in 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/doctorwho_hannahmurray.jpg" alt="Hannah Murray, the Doctor’s new companion?"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the theme, Ms. Murray is a cutie, but I’m starting to wonder. With &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/03/the-new-doctor-who/"&gt;the new Doctor being played by an actor who is only 27&lt;/a&gt;, they may have picked her to make the Doctor look older. I’m starting to suspect that after the next regeneration, the Doctor will be played by a fetus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, consider this in the rumor stage. But it’ll be a while before this one’s confirmed, since the first of the last shows with David Tennant &lt;a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/television/213395/doctor_who_special_no_2_at_christmas.html"&gt;won’t air until Easter&lt;/a&gt;, and the next one after that won’t be until — cripes! — December! The rumor mill will have at least a year to churn, so expect lots of twists in this particular plot as time unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236644010694"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/lifting_the_stem_cell_ban_-_wa.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aa4dddf706a07179</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Stem Cells"/><title type="html">Lifting the stem cell ban - was there any point?</title><published>2009-03-09T22:05:47Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T22:05:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/MpjM9KW7b3Q/lifting_the_stem_cell_ban_-_wa.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/03/lifting_the_stem_cell_ban_-_wa.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/us/politics/10stem.html?_r=1&amp;amp;hp"&gt;President Obama has lifted the ban on embryonic stem cell research&lt;/a&gt; enacted by Bush, but I'm left feeling that this intervention came many years too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Pledging that his administration will "make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideology," President Obama on Monday lifted the Bush administration's strict limits on human embryonic stem cell research.

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Obama went on to say that the majority of Americans "have come to a consensus that we should pursue this research; that the potential it offers is great, and with proper guidelines and strict oversight the perils can be avoided."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In making his announcement, Mr. Obama drew a strict line against human cloning, an issue that over the years has become entangled with the debate over human embryonic stem cell research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As someone who works with stem cells I find this largely an empty, symbolic act, but one that needed to be done anyway.  The reality is the damage was done by Bush already, and we're fortunate that it was only a temporary delay in some of the most important research humans have developed to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a lot of people don't realize is that in 2006 a revolutionary result was discovered by Japanese scientists led by Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University.  What they found was the reset button for mammalian cells, the genes that need to be expressed for a cell to revert to a pluripotent state.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/06/reprogramming_adult_stells_to.php"&gt;We wrote extensively&lt;/a&gt; about what results in these cells - induced Pluripotent Stem Cells or iPSC - mean for stem cell research and regenerative medicine overall.  Basically, the ability to reprogram the cells of any individual to a totipotent state - one in which the cells may make any cell-type or tissue in the human body.  Before some fool suggests this was due to Bush remember it was a Japanese group, the research started &lt;i&gt;long&lt;/i&gt; before Bush, and it never would have been possible without ES cells from which they culled the critical genes for the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why does it matter that Obama has reversed this policy?  Not only are ES cells inferior compared to iPSC for human therapies, but wouldn't it be easier not to upset the fundamentalists that would equate the value of our lives to that of a ball of undifferentiated cells?&lt;br&gt;

Both people with a formal diagnosis and who are self or peer diagnosed are welcome to participate in the study.  The study is written in English but open to people in any country.  Below is the recruitment message; if you're interested go to &lt;a href="http://www.joycedavidson.com/index-survey.html"&gt;www.joycedavidson.com/index-survey.html&lt;/a&gt; to start the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participants needed for study researching Internet usage by people on the Autism Spectrum. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Joyce Davidson of Queen's University and Professor Michael Orsini of the University of Ottawa would like to recruit people with an Autism Spectrum Condition to take part in a research project (funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the federal granting agency for university-based researchers) about their use of and views about Internet communication with others on the Autism Spectrum. Participants will be asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire designed by Joyce Davidson, which could take as little as 20 minutes to complete. (Questions are open-ended, and you may provide as much or as little information about your views on Internet usage and the autism spectrum as you wish.)&lt;/p&gt;

You have taken the first step towards attempting to communicate your expertise and thoughts to the wider world, which remains poorly served by its traditional sources of information when it comes to complex societally relevant issues like climate change. Your aim to clarify the science (or policy options or ethical considerations or simply to explain your views) is a noble endeavor and we wish you luck and wide readership. But do be aware that you are dipping your blog into sometimes treacherous waters. &lt;a href="http://initforthegold.blogspot.com/2009/03/for-second-day-in-row.html"&gt;Bad things&lt;/a&gt; can happen to good bloggers. So in a spirit of blog-camaraderie, and in light of our own experiences and observations, we offer some advice that may be of some help in navigating the political climate relatively unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Be honest to yourself and your readers. &lt;/b&gt; If your aim is to educate, say so. If your aim is to push for more funding for your pet projects, or advocate for a specific policy, be upfront about it. Don't however be surprised if people spend their time trying to find hidden motives in what you do. There is a school of thought had has decreed that any public speech must be directed towards public action and that there is no such thing as a pure information supply. In the widest sense this is probably true - everyone blogs, writes or speaks out for a reason. However, this is often interpreted as implying that all public speech must be either pro-or-con some very specific proposal. This is nonsense. One can criticize George Will's or Alexander Cockburn's misuse of climate science without agreeing or disagreeing or even having looked at their public policy proposals. Of course, the corollary of this position, that any such criticism of your statements must itself be directed at supporting the opposite political action is very rarely appreciated. On the other hand, assuming that criticism of your statements must be politically motivated is usually a mistake. Sometimes that is true, but there are enough exceptions that it should not be assumed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Know that there are people who will misrepresent you. &lt;/b&gt; Climate science is perceived to have political, economic and ethical implications. Most of the what gets discussed really doesn't have any such implication, but the '&lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2004.06.001"&gt;scientization&lt;/a&gt;' of political discourse on this issue means that micro-parsing of published work and blog postings is a common practice. Advocates of all stripes (though predominantly those outside the mainstream) will examine whether a new result or comment appears to project onto their particular agenda, and trumpet it widely if it does. The motives can range from specifically political to a desire for publicity or position, though the exact reasons are often obscure and mostly not worth debating. Thus 15th Century tree rings become an argument against the Kyoto Protocol, just as bacterial flagella are whipped into service when discussing the role of religion in public life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the specific world of climate-related blogs there are a number of conduits by which misrepresentations gain wider currency. Matt Drudge for instance, spends an inordinate amount of time finding crackpot climate science stories in fringe media and highlighting them on the widely-read Drudge Report. Marc Morano (who &lt;a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/03/06/morano-leaves-inhofe/"&gt;we hear&lt;/a&gt; is leaving his post as a staffer for Senator Inhofe) is a very diligent reader of the climate blogs (Pielke&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, WUWT, RC etc.) and any misrepresentation found there, or criticism that could be misrepresented, will quickly find its way into many email in-boxes. From there, if you are lucky, further misrepresentations might find their way onto the Rush Limbaugh's show (via Roy Spencer), or Glenn Beck as throwaway lines confirming (to them) the perfidy of mainstream climate science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be aware that the impact that you have might be very different from the impact that you think you should have.&lt;/b&gt; Over time, if you find yourself constantly misquoted or used to support positions or ideas you don't agree with, think about why that might be. You will likely find yourself accused of 'stealth advocacy' i.e. of secretly agreeing with the misquoters. If that isn't actually the case, remember that the abandonment of responsibility for your words (i.e. "how was I to know I would be misquoted so often?") is not an option that leaves you with much integrity. Being misquoted once might be a misfortune, being misquoted more often smacks of carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Don't expect the world to be fair. &lt;/b&gt; Read Mamet's "&lt;a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2005/06/0080591"&gt;Bambi v. Godzilla&lt;/a&gt;", and in particular the section containing this line: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In these fibbing competitions, the party actually wronged, the party with an actual practicable program, or possessing an actually beneficial product, is at a severe disadvantage; he is stuck with a position he cannot abandon, and, thus, cannot engage his talents for elaboration, distraction, drama and subterfuge."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you are presumably stuck with a coherent set of ideas, you won't be able to adopt ten mutually contradictory inconsistent arguments in the same paragraph, or engage in the cherry-picking, distortion or deliberate misquotation. Though it is occasionally instructive to show what you could have claimed if you didn't have such ethical principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Don't let completely unfounded critiques bother you. &lt;/b&gt; If you speak out in the public sphere, as sure as night follows day, you will be criticized. Some criticisms are constructive and will help you find your voice. Many are not. If you are successful, you will start to come across an online simulacrum of you that bears your name and place of work but who holds none of your views, has no redeeming character traits and would be a complete stranger to anyone who has actually met you. Ignore him or her. There are some people who will always be happier demonising opponents than honestly interacting with real people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Don't defame people. &lt;/b&gt;  This should go without saying, but trivially accusing scientists of dishonesty, theft, academic malpractice and fraud pretty much rules you out of serious conversation. Instead it will serve mainly to marginalize you - though you may gain a devoted following among a specific subset. Don't be surprised if as a consequence other people start to react negatively to your comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Correct mistakes. &lt;/b&gt; Again, it should go without saying that maintaining integrity requires that errors of fact be corrected as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Realize that although you speak for yourself, if you take mainstream positions, you will be perceived  as speaking for the whole climate science community.&lt;/b&gt; Don't therefore criticize unnamed 'scientists' in general when you mean to be specific, and don't assume that the context in which you are speaking is immediately obvious to casual readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Avoid using language that can easily be misquoted.&lt;/b&gt; This is hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Don't use any WWII metaphors. Ever. &lt;/b&gt; This just makes it too easy for people to ratchet up the rhetoric and faux outrage. However strongly you hold your views, the appropriateness of these images is always a hard sell, and you will not be given any time in which to make your pitch. This is therefore almost always counter-productive. This can be extended to any kind of Manichean language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; If you get noticed by the propagandists, wear that attention like a badge of honor. &lt;/b&gt; You will be in very good company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; If you get caught in a blogstorm, know that this too will pass. &lt;/b&gt; Being targeted like this is not very much fun (ask Heidi Cullen). But the lifecycle for a blog-related kerfuffle is a few days in general, and the blogosphere as a whole has an extreme attention deficit disorder. After finding that your post and followups were all anyone can talk about on Monday, it likely won't get mentioned again after Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Recognize that humor is far more effective than outrage. &lt;/b&gt; But try and rise above the level of the schoolyard. Think Jon Stewart rather than Rodney Dangerfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of the above doesn't put you off the idea completely, welcome to the blogosphere! Your voice is sorely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

You really must go listen to his speech on the occasion — he seems to get what scientific research is all about. Man, it&amp;#39;s been a long eight years, and oh is it wonderfully good to hear an eloquent defense of scientific research from our president, for a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ugly little goblins of the Bush years still plague us, though; compare the uplifting message of knowledge from Obama with this &lt;a href="http://foxforum.blogs.foxnews.com/2009/03/09/milloy_stem_cells/"&gt;fundamentally fallacious opinion piece from the carnie barker of junk science, Steven Milloy&lt;/a&gt;. And by &amp;quot;fundamentally fallacious&amp;quot;, I mean that it&amp;#39;s problems are far deeper than his usual slithery tweaking of the facts to misrepresent the evidence and the science — I mean that right at the core of Milloy is an absolute lack of comprehension of the very nature of science, and it&amp;#39;s right there, exposed and naked and hideous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His problem? He thinks his ignorance of the field is an accurate picture, and he thinks science ought to be more like a vending machine: put in your nickel, and the bubble gum you wanted pops out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.towson.edu"&gt;Towson &lt;del&gt;State&lt;/del&gt; University&lt;/a&gt; in Maryland is launching a postbaccalaureate degree in autism studies. As noted in the March 8th &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hankthetank/3313683861/"&gt;Towerlight Online&lt;/a&gt;, the 16-credit program will begin in Fall 2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The certificate will be a 16-credit interdisciplinary studies program featuring five three-credit courses and one capstone course worth one credit. The three core courses of the program will focus on current issues with infants and children, family issues, and adults. The other two courses will be electives chosen from the students' own discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Lisa Crabtree, clinical assistant professor for the department of occupational therapy and &lt;a href="http://grad.towson.edu/program/doctoral/osc-scd/"&gt;occupational science&lt;/a&gt; and Towson's &lt;a href="http://www.towson.edu/chp/caasd/"&gt;Center for Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder&lt;/a&gt; director, the new program is "'..... going to offer opportunities for people to meet and be involved with people with autism as they're doing their coursework.'" Faculty and staff from speech, language pathology, special education, occupational therapy, psychology, IDHP and family studies helped to create the certificate program.  (This is the original &lt;a href="http://www.mhec.state.md.us/higherEd/acadAff/AcadProgInstitApprovals/AcadProgDescriptions%5CAPTLogPDShow.asp?sPD=08293"&gt;program proposal&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this description, what do you think the autism studies program might be lacking or might add? Who do you think might seek to earn such a certificate? Would people be more likely to seek such a certificate or rather a Masters or other degree in a different academic discipline, to learn about individuals on the spectrum and autism and best teach and support them? (I think courses on the history of autism, disability studies and autism, and literature and films on autism would also be good to have.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236632835882"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8442123349816306">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a00ab79ad7cacc7f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogs" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Happy Birthday PZ!</title><published>2009-03-09T20:49:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T21:07:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/happy-birthday-pz.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8442123349816306/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8442123349816306" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Today is PZ Meirirz birthday.

It’s time we once again put science at the top of our agenda and worked to restore America’s place as the world leader in science and technology.” - President Barack Obama&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the just released &lt;b&gt;Presidential Memorandum on Scientific Integrity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Science and the scientific process must inform and guide decisions of my Administration on a wide range of issues, including improvement of public health, protection of the environment, increased efficiency in the use of energy and other resources, mitigation of the threat of climate change, and protection of national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public must be able to trust the science and scientific process informing public policy decisions.  Political officials should not suppress or alter scientific or technological findings and conclusions.  If scientific and technological information is developed and used by the Federal Government, it should ordinarily be made available to the public.  To the extent permitted by law, there should be transparency in the preparation, identification, and use of scientific and technological information in policymaking.  The selection of scientists and technology professionals for positions in the executive branch should be based on their scientific and technological knowledge, credentials, experience, and integrity…
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the whole thing &lt;a href="http://sharp.sefora.org/issues/scientific-integrity-memo/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to overstate the degree to which this statement is a departure from the last eight years.&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="http://www.kansascity.com/238/story/1065619.html"&gt;recent letter will make you laugh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAR BILLY GRAHAM: Why do people get involved in cults? My cousin has gotten involved in one, and no matter what we say to him, he refuses to listen. He says we are the ones who are in the dark, and he alone in our family has found the truth. -- S. McM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's a real problem, and I'm sure we all know someone who has gone off the deep end with some weird belief. That's not the funny part; the good bit is Graham's oblivious reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEAR S. McM: One characteristic of cults is that they strongly believe they alone are right in their beliefs and everyone else is wrong. Thus they reject the central truths of the Bible that Christians have held in common for almost 2,000 years and substitute their own beliefs for the clear teaching of Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shorter Billy Graham: The difference between their cult and mine is that they think they have the absolute truth, when I know that I do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/billy_graham_answers_his_email.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/U9hsOrBcZTc" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236632221555"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/09/deimos/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/371cb857c2f0199e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Pretty pictures"/><title type="html">Deimos!</title><published>2009-03-09T20:45:44Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T20:45:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/09/deimos/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The HiRISE camera onboard MRO &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/deimos.php"&gt;just took this phenomenal picture of one of the moons of Mars, Deimos&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/deimos.php"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/hirise_deimos.jpg" alt="HiRISE view of Deimos"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is so cool! Deimos is the smaller of the two moons, a lumpy ball 15 x 12 x 10 km in size (Phobos is 27 x 22 x 18). Deimos has incredibly weak gravity; its escape velocity is only about 20 km/hr, so you could throw a baseball right off into space, and biking without taking an unintentional EVA would be difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/deimos/deimos.png"&gt;another picture&lt;/a&gt; showing Deimos from two slightly different angles (though the angle to the Sun had changed enough to provide a different lighting angle). The resolution is such that you can see features as small as 60 meters across, smaller than a football field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some small impact craters on its surface, and it also has lots of smooth areas. Those latter are probably covered in regolith, rocks ground into fine ground powder from eons of micrometeorite impacts (much like the surface of the our own Moon). As the HiRISE page points out, you can see subtle color differences, with areas around craters being lighter, and smoother areas redder in color. As material like that is exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun, it undergoes photolysis — having its chemical structure changed — and it becomes redder. So you can get an idea of relative ages of the surface just by looking at the color! As you might expect, regions around craters are younger, and tend to be lighter in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one exception is the crater to the right of the picture; it’s possible that the regolith has flowed &amp;quot;downhill&amp;quot; even in the low gravity, covering the crater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this blog know pretty much &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/postholiday_the_stupid_it_burns_part_1_j.php"&gt;what I think of Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. In brief, she's an opportunistic, scientifically ignorant but media-savvy twit whose hubris leads her to believe that her Google University education, coupled with her personal anecdotal experience, render her proclamations that vaccines cause autism and that "biomedical" quackery can cure it more convincing than all that boring science, epidemiology, and clinical trials. Indeed, her critical thinking skills are so poor that she was once a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_generation_woo.php"&gt;huge booster of the "Indigo Child" movement&lt;/a&gt;, but had to try to purge the Internet of all traces of her involvement with that woo in order to be reborn as a "mother warrior" fighting to cure autism--or at least to keep parents from vaccinating their children. Or, as the mad Photoshopping skills of Rebel Macaque &lt;a href="http://hellsnewsstand.blogspot.com/2009/03/medical-wackaloon-monthly.html"&gt;parody her&lt;/a&gt;, she's a medical whackaloon, much as all the others parodied are. (The tattoo on her right arm is a particularly brilliant addition to the parody.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you think I'm tough on poor ol' Jenny, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Check out this series of posts from &lt;a href="http://thedailygonzo.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Daily Gonzo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thedailygonzo.blogspot.com/2009/02/jenny-and-me.html"&gt;Jenny and Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thedailygonzo.blogspot.com/2009/02/and-now-i-must-go-and-bleach-my-brain.html"&gt;...and now I must go and bleach my brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thedailygonzo.blogspot.com/2009/03/whats-wal-mart-do-they-sell-walls-and.html"&gt;"What's Wal-mart? Do they sell walls and stuff?"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thedailygonzo.blogspot.com/2009/03/generation-revenue.html"&gt;Generation Revenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://thedailygonzo.blogspot.com/2009/03/emotional-wellness.html"&gt;Emotional Wellness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, what I find most amusing about Generation Rescue and Age of Autism is how hypocritical they are. They castigate, for instance, Dr. Paul Offit for having had his work funded by pharmaceutical companies, going so far as to call him "Dr. Proffit"; yet they chase after every dollar they can from sponsorships by purveyors of dubious "biomedical" treatments for autism. Meanwhile, Jenny and Jim command &lt;a href="http://thedailygonzo.blogspot.com/2009/03/whats-wal-mart-do-they-sell-walls-and.html"&gt;big bucks on the speaking circuit&lt;/a&gt; (Jim more than Jenny; being a real, as opposed to washed-up, star has its advantages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's very relaxing and amusing for me to let someone else dump on Jenny McCarthy and her "autism charity" Generation Rescue for a while, while I just sit back and enjoy. Every so often, even Orac needs some down time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/in_which_orac_sits_back_and_lets_someone.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/zyNRE9KuMfE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236630606964"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8620529713714640853">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dca925424b1a6578</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Monday's Molecule #111</title><published>2009-03-09T20:07:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T20:32:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/mondays-molecule-111.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Identify this molecule.

&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been mobilizing skeptics in my local area (glorious Columbus, Ohio) and we’ve been looking for a variety of volunteer opportunities.

It's about 2 weeks from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_1.php"&gt;Match Day&lt;/a&gt; (the 19th), when I'll find out for sure where I will spend the next 5 or so years of my life.  I'll be sure to have a post up a little after noon that day when I find out what the answer is.  And then, around May 17th, graduation day, I'll be a medical doctor, ready to start internship (also known as the hardest year of your life).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've found universal to all medical students is that we &lt;i&gt;really want&lt;/i&gt; to be good doctors when we are finished with our training.  I don't think I've ever met a medical student who was in this career for the money (you'd be crazy), or for other selfish reasons.  They tend to be hard working, dedicated, humble people who, if anything, are sickeningly sincere about wanting to help other people.  Maybe that's just my school, but my experience is, these folks want to do good in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But another universal is that not all doctors will be able to avoid making mistakes.  Doctors are human, they all will eventually make errors, and the goal of any profession dedicated to improving the human condition should be constant self-reflection and efforts at self-improvement.  This is not a simple thing to do however.  Medicine is complex, and quality of medical treatment is very difficult to assess.  We've discussed before, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/07/are_metrics_in_medicine_a_good_1.php"&gt;using metrics in medicine is challenging&lt;/a&gt;, and often rather than studying medical quality you end up merely assessing the social demographics of the physicians' patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is with interest that I see &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/03/05/doctors-force-patien.html"&gt;reading boingboing&lt;/a&gt; that lots of people are upset because some doctors &lt;a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/news/ap/20090304/ap_on_hi_te/med_gagging_patients"&gt;are forcing their patients &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to rate them on sites like RateMD.com&lt;/a&gt; by having them sign a contract forbidding them from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments for and against this practice are fascinating.  We tread into the mucky waters of free speech, free enterprise, the practice of medicine, and the practical problem of assessing physician quality...&lt;/p&gt;

You may recall he promised to do this during his campaign, and made a point of it &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=42#8"&gt;in his answers for Science Debate 2008&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He even went further, adding to the Order a section &lt;a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/03/09/1828302.aspx"&gt;to protect scientific research against political influence&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although officials would not go into details, the memorandum will order the Office of Science and Technology Policy to &amp;quot;assure a number of effective standards and practices that will help our society feel that we have the highest-quality individuals carrying out scientific jobs and that information is shared with the public,&amp;quot; said Harold Varmus, who co-chairs Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is very, very good news. I wrote extensively over the past few years on how the Bush Administration unduly influenced the progress and release of scientific research due to what was clearly partisan and ideological beliefs. Again, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedebate2008.com/www/index.php?id=42#12"&gt;Obama promised to do this in the Science Debate 2008 answers&lt;/a&gt;, and he has again followed through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard work will begin soon, enforcing this policy and making sure narrow ideological beliefs do not impede our investigation of reality. But that’s work I bet a lot of people will be eager to undertake.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236624065845"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8593715744463390465">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/103c764ee333e9de</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Journalism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Good Quality Journalism Sells Newspapers</title><published>2009-03-09T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T19:06:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/good-quality-journalism.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8593715744463390465/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8593715744463390465" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> On Saturday night we celebrated my nephew&amp;#39;s birthday at Pic Nic on Queen St. East.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/mccain_beaker.jpg" alt="McCain tested scientifically"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post I made last week about &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/02/27/john-mccain-still-really-hates-science/"&gt;McCain being antiscience&lt;/a&gt; has made quite a splash, more than I expected (and I expected quite a bit). As usual when I post on politics I have been lauded as a voice of reason, told I am a political moron, had my arguments backed up by others with evidence, and attacked with ad hominems (despite &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/10/03/comments-policy/"&gt;my commenting policy&lt;/a&gt;, which I even linked to in the post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest I think any of the attacks on my reasoning came to being correct were ones that pointed out that McCain hates earmarks, not science. That may be true (although his choice of Palin for Vice President — &lt;a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008154532_webpalin02m.html"&gt;who loves her some earmarks&lt;/a&gt; — makes that argument a bit weak), but it occurs to me he chooses science an awful lot for ridicule when lambasting earmarks. Three of his Top Ten choices on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/status/1259912841"&gt;his Twitter feed about earmarks&lt;/a&gt; were science-based, for example (and lots more science research bashing can be found on that feed), and he used his awful planetarium comment three times in speeches, including a nationally-televised debate with Obama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And given how far he pandered to his party’s base — going &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=1779141"&gt;from first calling Jerry Falwell an &amp;quot;agent of intolerance&amp;quot;, to then speaking at the graduation ceremony at Falwell’s Liberty University&lt;/a&gt; comes right to mind — I think it’s fair to wonder how much he panders on the issue of science as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if we ignore all that, the point is, he is ridiculing science research. It may be that he hates science earmarks as much as he hates any other kind, but the tone and content of what he is saying make his stance against science very clear. He said, specifically, &amp;quot;nothing says new jobs for average Americans like investing in astronomy.&amp;quot; But, in fact, investing in science always pays off in the long run, as I have noted on this blog about 20 times in the past (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/28/why-explore-space/"&gt;here’s one on space exploration&lt;/a&gt;, for example). Even astronomy pays off. Basic research always does. That’s why it’s an investment, and not pork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the tone of that comment makes it clear he is deriding science. He could have said, &amp;quot;Investing in astronomy won’t help the common citizen put dinner on the table&amp;quot; which would have been no less inaccurate than what he said, but wouldn’t have been insulting. But then, it wouldn’t have been a zinger, either. Maybe he’s just trying to make snarky soundbites, but it doesn’t matter: &lt;em&gt;the end product betrays a lack of understanding of science, a deliberate twisting of it, and a general tone of disregard for what that science does&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/04/scientists-are-not-you-and-me/"&gt;Julianne on Cosmic Variance has more to say on this&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;Us versus Them&amp;quot; mentality many on the far right have been shilling for years now, a conscious effort to mock those Americans with educations, including, and especially, scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/13/i-am-elitist/"&gt;I am elitist&lt;/a&gt;. I want the best for myself, my family, my country, my planet. And I damn well want it in my politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note: yes, the far right lost a lot of ground in the last election, and yes more moderate people took control (more or less) of Congress. So why attack them now? Because &lt;em&gt;the far right is not gone&lt;/em&gt;. Many people hailed McCain as a moderate when he first got in the presidential race, but by the end that was no longer true, as he sold off that moderate stance bit by bit to the party base. The far right still has a voice, still has influence, and in less than two years they may yet get their own elected to Congress in the midterms. Ignore them at your own peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Win or lose, the forces of antiscience will always be out there, and will always be one election away from spreading their nonsense again. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. &lt;/p&gt;

Research and Planning: The &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/"&gt;Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)&lt;/a&gt; has put out a &lt;a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/mar2009/nimh-05.htm"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; on the First Federal Strategic Plan for Autism Research. The &lt;a href="http://iacc.hhs.gov/reports/2009/iacc-strategic-plan-for-aqutism-spectrum-disorder-research-jan26.shtml"&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt; is also available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Safety and Police: On the topic of police safety for adults, a &lt;a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stcharles/story/E8801AC4BBEC1D3F86257571000A028E?OpenDocument"&gt;program in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt; (MO) enabled adults with disabilities and adults with police officer licenses to learn from each other.  The idea came from the mother of an adult autistic son.  The idea of letting autistic people and police people learn directly from each other instead of through some "expert" intermediary is deeply appealing to me--it enables both populations to really learn about the needs of the other in a way a bunch of slides and films never could capture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Music and AS: To get in my requisite art-of-some-sort mention, here's a &lt;a href="http://mcv.e-p.net.au/features/mccrossin-on-parade-5102.html"&gt;short story and interview with musician Gary Numan&lt;/a&gt;, a living famous person who actually does have an Asperger's diagnosis (as opposed to all the dead people who receive their Dx via post-humorous conjecture).  Music clips, video, and more of Numan's work at &lt;a href="http://www.garynuman.co.uk/index.html"&gt;nuworld&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Chocolate and Justice: Lindt chocolates is about to fundraise for Autism Speaks, an organization which most assuredly does not speak for many of us as it excludes autistic people in its policy and uses pity and hate to line its wallet at the expense of human dignity and respect.

&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting just how banal this seems to get when you see all those stains, squiggles, pieces of food, and grain patterns lined up over and over again. I understand that people want to touch the spiritual, to be connected with something bigger than themselves, but even if you are deeply religious is it too much to admit that this all might be coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the mighty have fallen. I used to do all my plans and maps in a hard-core CAD program using a digitising tablet, but then WinXP came along and my mid-90s software would no longer run. For years now I've been tracing maps onto translucent film with a pencil, scanning them and editing them in PhotoShop and Windows Paint. Here's an example of my handiwork, and a snippet of the paper I made it for, submitted last week.&lt;blockquote&gt;The first decisive step in the formation of the Medieval state of Sweden appears to have been taken about AD 1000 when two ethnic groups, the Svear and the Götar, elected a shared king: Olof Eriksson &lt;i&gt;skotkonungr&lt;/i&gt;. The Svear lived around Lake Mälaren, the Götar on either side of Lake Vättern (fig. 1), and their fertile lands were separated by the rugged forests of Tiveden and Kolmården. At any one time during the later 1st Millennium these two groups most likely had several petty kings each, warlike characters whose exploits appear to be reflected dimly in the Scilfingas and Geatas of Beowulf. Written sources for the land of the Götar in that era are so few that the field of study is just barely proto-historical.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the area enters the first flickering historical torchlight in the eleventh century, the lands of the Götar are divided into two halves separated by Lake Vättern: Västergötland and Östergötland. They somehow belong together as lands of the Götar, but the western part is politically and culturally orientated towards the Danish kingdom to the south-west, and the eastern part shows affinities with the Swedish kingdom to the north-east. Viking Period settlement in Östergötland is largely confined to a wide west-east plains belt through the province and was expanding up two river valleys in the forests to the south. The easternmost quarter of the fertile plains belt is a peninsula, Vikbolandet, where the sea is never farther off than 9 km (5½ miles). Vikbolandet was densely settled at the time. It is highly accessible from the Baltic, and thus vulnerable, and it was orientated immediately towards the lands of the Svear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper I review the evidence for Vikbolandet's relationship with powers from the sea in the Viking Period. We shall look at fortifications, boat burials, precious-metal finds, rune stones and the first royal manors of the united kingdom of Sweden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/2009/03/mapping_swedes_and_geats.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/lgtN/~4/vvdgoRbk5og" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/lgtN</id><title type="html">Aardvarchaeology</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236613824227"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/you_can_stop_now_jim.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ad64fb3813582cb5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Kooks"/><title type="html">You can stop now, Jim</title><published>2009-03-09T15:54:20Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T15:54:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/c4r2vMXhXus/you_can_stop_now_jim.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/you_can_stop_now_jim.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mr &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/i_get_email_33.php"&gt;James M.

He has sent me a few other emails (which I just trashed on sight), and now someone at the IP address 67.177.100.132 (which traces back to Shelbyville…Hi, Jim!) has attempted to subscribe me to a large body of gay and fetish porn. Who knew there were sites dedicated to &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; pictures of young boys' feet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the people who run these porn sites are not stupid, and they know they&amp;#39;ll be abused by homophobes who think they are a weapon. Before they send me a pile of glossy magazines and DVDs they verify by sending an email, with the IP address of the person who tried to subscribe me. Busted! Tsk, tsk…how petty, Mr Baker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only question now is how Mr Baker came to have such a working familiarity with so many diverse sites, with such a focus on gay sex, feet, and watersports?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, someone else has &lt;a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/view/2071053"&gt;associated me with porn&lt;/a&gt; with a bit more humor…and a more appropriate focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide-ranging study on American religious life found that the Roman Catholic population has been shifting out of the Northeast to the Southwest, the percentage of Christians in the nation has declined and more people say they have no religion at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fifteen percent of respondents said they had no religion, an increase from 14.2 percent in 2001 and 8.2 percent in 1990, according to the American Religious Identification Survey.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Northern New England surpassed the Pacific Northwest as the least religious region, with Vermont reporting the highest share of those claiming no religion, at 34 percent. Still, the study found that the numbers of Americans with no religion rose in every state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep those godless numbers going up!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/awww_what_a_sweet_birthday_pre.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236612280495"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5919966246106118401">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8a251f9e99396654</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolutionary Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Epigenetics, Lamarck, and Darwin.</title><published>2009-03-09T15:19:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T15:24:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/03/epigenetics-lamarck-and-darwin.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/5919966246106118401/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=5919966246106118401" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Ryan Gregory at Genomicron educates us about Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de la Marck and Charles Darwin [Lamarck didn&amp;#39;t say it, Darwin did.What people insist on dubbing &amp;quot;Lamarckian inheritance&amp;quot; in the context of epigenetics is actually closer to the view held by Darwin than by Lamarck....</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236609962673"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=510">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c2d294183b7471d9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Ghosts/Demons"/><category term="Paranormal"/><category term="Science Education"/><category term="education"/><category term="ghost"/><category term="science"/><title type="html">Lower Learning</title><published>2009-03-09T13:36:41Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T13:36:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=510" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a new science being taught at college level educational facilities here in Connecticut. &lt;a href="http://www.acc.commnet.edu/"&gt;Asnuntuck Community College&lt;/a&gt; in Enfield, Connecticut is offering what they are calling a “Ghost Science” class. This could perhaps be the most oxymoronic title I have ever encountered in all my years of skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghost related courses and studies are not entirely new to college campuses. There are numerous continuing education programs that offer courses in all sorts of paranormal and pseudoscientific garbage. Next time you get one of those local continuing education brochures in your mail, flip through it and I am sure you will find at least one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is the first time that I have ever encountered the notion of ghosts being taught specifically as a science. Here is the official course description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to know the science behind paranormal investigation? Let an experienced paranormal researcher tell you about the types of haunting and how they are investigated! From demons to poltergeists, you’ll learn the types of spirits commonly encountered and the means by which they are detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics, for as long as skepticism has been around, have yearned to be shown the science of the paranormal. We have begged, pleaded, and offered our assistance in perpetuity to paranormal researchers to apply real science to their trades. But there is a fundamental problem for the researchers: when you apply real science to the paranormal, all paranormal activity disappears. Oh no! That spells certain doom for the paranormal business, so paranormal researchers tend to stay clear of real science for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In place of actual science, they offer their own brand of science. They have tools, techniques, and theories that do not meet the rigors and structures of actual science. In fact, their whole model is anti-scientific in that they start with conclusions (ghosts, demons, and poltergeists exist) and work backwards to try and create an environment in which their conclusions could possibly exist. It is the antithesis of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course description continues …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to be able to identify or hunt for ghosts? Seasoned paranormal investigator David Manch (Author of the book THERE ARE GHOSTS IN OUR WORLD) will show you the difference between demons and poltergeists, and how to investigate the paranormal for yourself. David will discuss the types of haunting, where they occur, and what causes them. You’ll learn how to distinguish fakes from phantoms, and hear some of the astonishing EVP’s (voices from beyond the grave) captured during actual paranormal investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so … where is the science? The title of this course is ‘Ghost Science’, and all we have is a dubious individual who wrote a book based on a wholly anti-scientific conclusion. They do say that we’ll hear some EVP’s (which stands for electronic voice phenomenon – I suppose it was too much work to write that out) which they claim to be ‘voices beyond the grave’. I can’t wait to taught the science behind that claim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called the college and asked them some questions concerning this course. The good news is that this is just a continuing education course, and there is no credit given to any students attending. None of the college’s actual courses that are covered by tuition are encouraging the students to attend for extra credit or anything else that could possibly impact a student’s grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that the folks at &lt;a href="http://www.newenglandparanormal.com/home.php"&gt;New England Paranormal&lt;/a&gt; submitted their description of this course, title and all, and the college accepted it with no qualms. It turns out that although this is the first ‘ghost’ course they have ever offered, they regularly have local psychics come in to teach continuing ed courses on all of the nonsense that psychics peddle, such as tarot cards and seances. The bottom line here is that if it tickles the fancy of the folks at Asnuntuck Community College, they gladly lend their name and reputation to allow the woo crowd to move in and ply their pseudoscientific trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am considering taking the ‘Ghost Science’ class so that there can be at least one skeptic there to offer some real scientific perspective to all of the anti-scientific concepts they will propose. I hate the idea of lining their coffers with my money, but it could be a very worthwhile experience. If anyone in the area wishes to join me, drop me a line so we can coordinate our efforts.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PZ's muscling in on my territory. Apparently, ruling the Darwinian, creationist-destroying atheist cephalopod blogging world isn't enough, and he has to start moving in on medicine. No problem, given that this time around he brought some &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_woo_it_burns.php"&gt;rather interesting woo&lt;/a&gt; to my attention, suggesting it as perhaps a suitable topic for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://www.gods-answer-to-cancer.com/"&gt;God's Answer to Cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Besides, it's PZ's birthday; so as a birthday present, instead of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/03/happy_birthday_to_pz.php"&gt;reposting the same silly picture&lt;/a&gt; that I have for the last two years, I'll simply &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_woo_it_burns.php"&gt;link to him now&lt;/a&gt; and add, oh, perhaps 1% to his traffic total for today, if that. No need to thank me, PZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's some primo, grade-A woo alright, but I'm not so sure it's a good topic for YFDoW for the simple reason that I've become very leery of certain kinds of cancer woo. You see, after once having featured the utter quackery that has claimed lives known as the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_iron_rule.php"&gt;German New Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, I'm a lot less enthusiastic about featuring such utter cancer quackery with the potential to do the same sort of thing. You see, at the time, I had no idea that this quackery had a rather large body count, and, let's face it, that's just not funny. Consequently, burned once, I've become a bit less willing to feature such blatant cancer quackery on YFDoW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, examining &lt;a href="http://www.gods-answer-to-cancer.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;God's Answer to Cancer&lt;/a&gt; (GAC) more closely, I saw that it is in fact a rather run-of-the-mill quack machine, not unlike Bill Nelson's Electro Physiological Feedback Xrroid (EPFX) machine, about which I've written at least three times (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/your_friday_dose_of_woo_miraculous_quest_1.php"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/04/your_friday_dose_of_woo_serious_woo_from.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/scio_and_quantum_xrroid_consciousness_in.php"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/why_do_intelligent_people_use_alternativ_1.php"&gt;Hulda Clark's parasite zapper&lt;/a&gt;--or even &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_a_bio-photon_her.php"&gt;Alan Back's Advanced Bio-photon Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;, featured here a mere ten days ago. What GAC does have, however, that distinguishes it from similar quack devices is a bizarre mish-mash of Christian and New Age charlatanry that is truly breathtaking. Even so, I might not have decided to write about it, PZ's having had his say, were it not for what I like to call a "teachable moment" in the comments. First, I'll briefly deconstruct the machine itself; then I'll spend much more time on the "teachable moment."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GAC website begins by blaming all disease on, in essence, original sin and saying that only God can heal. (Of course, that begs the question of why God would need a cheap-looking box of wires and lights in order to heal, but that's just the nasty, doubting skeptic in me speaking.) Thus, we have this &lt;a href="http://www.gods-answer-to-cancer.com/why.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/when_burning_woo_produces_deceptive_test.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/03/when_burning_woo_produces_deceptive_test.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/AevA1GcD760" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236606812235"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=492">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6a10542826f70e74</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pseudoscience"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">Neurometaphysics - BS In A Cheap Suit</title><published>2009-03-09T13:49:24Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T13:49:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=492" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Vitale_(author)"&gt;Dr. Joe Vitale&lt;/a&gt; is not a real doctor, in any sense of the word. He went to Kent State but failed to graduate. Then he received a “doctorate” in metaphysics from the unaccredited University of Metaphysics in Sedona, Arizona (America’s epicenter of woo). He also has an honorary doctorate from (also unaccredited) Belford University, an online diploma mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy wants to bring you the secret of neurometaphysics. Neurometaphysics is nothing more than a fancy name for “The Secret” - the magical belief that wishing for something makes it come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To any thinking person that’s probably all that needs to be said about it, but the window dressing is interesting. Promoters of The Secret claim they have discovered the “Law of Attraction” (LOA) - which is the power of positive thinking. Not in the ordinary sense that if you are a positive person you are more likely to be motivated and create opportunities for yourself, but in the overtly magical sense that the universe will respond to your positive energy and make this happen - by magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern gurus often like to throw around the word “science” to describe their BS. It’s just marketing, but it’s very irritating to those of us who actually care about the integrity of science. The worst of them invent new jargon, like neurometaphysics. But the only “science” that Vitale has to back his claims is the anecdotes of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also like most gurus, Vitale is intolerant of doubt. You must believe. &lt;a href="http://blog.mrfire.com/loa/what-to-do-when-the-law-of-attraction-doesnt-work/"&gt;He writes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When anything happens in your life, you can say it was LOA that made it so &lt;em&gt;or &lt;/em&gt;you can attribute the result to some other cause and pretend LOA doesn’t exist or doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we can always pretend. He continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Law of Attraction is the same as the Law of Gravity or any other law: it’s working whether you give it credit or not. Knowing about it can help you achieve the results you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you’re one of those who say LOA doesn’t work for you, then you might as well say gravity doesn’t work for you, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reassures us that the best approach is to forget all doubt and just accept that LOA works. He has more advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m constantly saying that you must get clear of the limiting beliefs within you in order to attract your intention. Counter-intentions will always trip you up. Be aware of your thoughts when things don’t work out for you. &lt;em&gt;Those&lt;/em&gt; are what you need to get clear of. &lt;em&gt;Those&lt;/em&gt; are the beliefs that attracted what you got. How do you get clear? One easy way is through Zero Limits. &lt;a href="http://www.zerolimits.info/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, all you have to do is buy his book. The core message here is the same as for most cons and belief systems - the magic always works, except when it doesn’t. And when it doesn’t, it was your fault for doubting the magic. When things go well for you, no matter what real-life factors may have been at work, it was really the magic. When things do not go well for you, that was your doubt in the magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert any magical belief system for “the magic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, any anecdotes that seem to support the magic are true, and any that seem to contradict the magic are false or misleading. This is a deliberate policy of confirmation bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a bad day then read the comments below any of his entries, but stop before you lose all faith in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claims in the ad that “pentapeptides” could reduce the appearance of visible lines and could be used as a substitute for cosmetic surgery were deemed misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ad, a voice-over from UK beauty journalist Eve Cameron said: “Women who aren’t ready for cosmetic injections constantly ask me to recommend a skin cream that really works”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:258px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/olay-regenerist.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="olay-regenerist" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/olay-regenerist.jpg" alt="Claims that regenerist cream could substitute or cosmetic surgery were rejected" width="248" height="203"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims that regenerist cream could substitute for cosmetic surgery were rejected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So I was excited when this study, revealed at the World Congress of Dermatology, showed that pentapeptides are effective in reducing the appearance of lines and wrinkles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint challenging the evidence for the effectiveness of pentapeptides in skin care products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not the first time expensive “cosmeceuticals” have been declared a rip-off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, a consumer organisation in the UK known as &lt;a href="http://www.which.magazine.co.uk/?jchk=1&amp;amp;nolog=1"&gt;Which? Magazine&lt;/a&gt; found &lt;a href="http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/beauty/article3076047.ece"&gt;skin care companies were “blinding consumers with science&lt;/a&gt;” using terms like nanoparticles, pentapeptides, lipopeptides and hyaluronic acid. These are all legitimate scientific words, and whilst some have been associated with skin repair, others are just there to sound sciencey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, hyaluronic acid is a component of the extracellular matrix, the “scaffolding” which supports the cells, and has been used to &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17173469?ordinalpos=3&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;assist in the repair of burns and wound healing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies also show injections of hyaluronic acid can relieve mild arthritis pain but &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18686758?ordinalpos=10&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;the literature remains divided&lt;/a&gt; and further research is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyaluronic acid &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16980841?ordinalpos=11&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;has replaced bovine or human collagen as an injectable soft-tissue filler&lt;/a&gt;, and there are several types currently licensed by the FDA in America.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/face-cream-sjp.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:3px" title="face-cream-sjp" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/face-cream-sjp-300x151.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="151"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aarathi Prasad, a biologist from &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/"&gt;Sense About Science&lt;/a&gt;, said that the claims for commercially available creams were: insulting to people’s intelligence. &lt;em&gt;“There may be evidence to justify using some of these chemicals — but not in products claiming to improve the signs of ageing or having an active effect on the skin. The companies are taking the real science out of context so it becomes bad science.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as for the use of nanoparticles? Well, not even customer service representatives could explain what the hell these were doing in the moisturising cream. &lt;em&gt;Which? Magazine&lt;/em&gt; discovered that the use of scientific jargon by skin care products, had become so widespread and complex that these “cosmeceuticals” could no longer be explained by customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They contacted customer service for Garnier, L’Oreal and Olay to ask for explanations of their sciencey sounding products. For example, when asked what was the hyaluronic acid contained in the L’Oréal moisturising cream, the company’s customer service representative incorrectly stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s not an actual acid,” before adding, “The product replumps, tautens and illuminates to give a radiance to the skin.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Moss, a pharmacist from the University of Hertfordshire, dismissed this explanation as “utter waffle”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyaluronic acid is indeed an acid, and there is no evidence that it plumps the skin when applied topically, only when it is injected ala botox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nanoparticles” on the other hand, included in some products may actually be harmful, and should be avoided, dermatologists suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding scientific jargon to a tiny bottle of cream, is just another way manufacturers can get away with charging you an arm and a leg for a tub of sorbolene and water with some nice perfume added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyer beware.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, as I have also demonstrated, it’s not just patients who can allow themselves to be misled by anecdotes, but &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=256"&gt;certain physicians&lt;/a&gt; who do not understand the scientific method but in their hubris think that their “personal clinical experience” trumps science, clinical trials, and epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is to say that there aren’t frequent instances when applying data from population-based studies to individual patients is problematic. It can indeed be. However, it often goes beyond that, and, indeed, if there is one defining characteristic of a quack that I’ve never failed to find when looking at individual cases, it’s a belief that he is able to identify when a treatment works based on his own personal experience and anecdotes. Unfortunately, it’s not just quacks who sometimes fall prey to this, because humans are cognitively wired to infer causation from correlation. This tendency, which was no doubt adaptive early in our evolution, simply doesn’t work well when it is applied to medicine and science. Without a doubt, it is the key driver, for example, behind the widely believed myth that vaccines somehow cause autism and that chelation therapy and other biomedical quackery can “cure” autism, a view popularized most recently by the very popular but very ignorant &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=194"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and before that by the outright dishonest &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=393"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other reasons why testimonials for quackery seem convincing is because most people simply do not know enough about disease, be it my specialty (cancer) or any other disease, how it is treated, and what its natural course can be expected to be. That is why, when I came across an example of just such a testimonial, specifically a breast cancer testimonial, I saw what is known as a “teachable moment. This teachable moment occurred on the very popular science blog &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, written by the ever sarcastic biology professor from Minnesota, P.Z. Myers. It actually surprised me in that the usual topics on Pharyngula include evolution, biology, the pseudoscience known as “intelligent design” creationism, politics, and atheism. P.Z. doesn’t usually dabble much in the realm of medical quackery, but my guess is that he was attracted to this particular piece of pseudoscience because of the religious angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the quackery under consideration is known as &lt;a href="http://www.gods-answer-to-cancer.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;God’s Answer to Cancer&lt;/a&gt; (GAC). Basically, it looks a lot like any number of quack electronic devices that promise to cure cancer; examples include Bill Nelson’s Electro Physiological Feedback Xrroid (EPFX) machine (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/your_friday_dose_of_woo_miraculous_quest_1.php"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/04/your_friday_dose_of_woo_serious_woo_from.php"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/08/scio_and_quantum_xrroid_consciousness_in.php"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/why_do_intelligent_people_use_alternativ_1.php"&gt;Hulda Clark’s parasite zapper&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/your_friday_dose_of_woo_a_bio-photon_her.php"&gt;Alan Back’s Advanced Bio-photon Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;. All of these devices promise, in essence, to use low level electrical energy to “boost the immune system” and “replenish your life energy” plus or minus an additional promise to “zap parasites” (Hulda Clark’s unique spin on these devices, in which she claims that all cancer, AIDS, and most other diseases are due to a liver fluke, which her device supposedly “zaps.” Like these devices, the maker of GAC promises vague “immune system boosts,” but with the added twist that he claims that all disease is due to original sin (along, apparently, with the conventional alt-med “toxins,” diminished &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;, and uncharacterized immune dysfunction). Amusingly, the Monsignor who created this device also disses Hulda Clark and advocates the use of laetrile and Linus Pauling’s orthomolecular medicine. The main difference is that he claims to have received the design for the device from God through a dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discussion of these various forms of quackery is beyond the scope of this post, and some of them have already been discussed before on this blog. such as &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=236"&gt;Linus Pauling’s advocacy of vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;. Suffice it to say that it is quackery, with no basis in science. What caught my interest was a testimonial by a commenter on P.Z.’s blog. He was most unhappy at some of the snarky comments and decided to provide a very typical cancer testimonial for alt-med that I thought to be worth deconstructing as a learning exercise. It began with a discussion of the Royal Rife device, which, suffice it to say is also quackery, albeit a form of quackery that hasn’t much been discussed on SBM. (Hmmm. Perhaps some blog fodder for next week?) The c&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_woo_it_burns.php#comment-1449135"&gt;ommenter, going by the ‘nym “gp,” began&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research of Royal Rife is largely obscured in mystery, and very few folks have been able to replicate his results based upon that secrecy. The work of Dr. Bob Beck on the other hand is well documented and with measurable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the reason that no one has been able to replicate the work of Royal Rife is because it’s pseudoscientific nonsense. Bob Beck’s protocol isn’t any better. In essence, it consists of what Beck calls “&lt;a href="http://www.sharinghealth.com/beckprotocol/whatismt.html"&gt;microcurrent&lt;/a&gt;” therapy, and a brief &lt;a href="http://www.cancertutor.com/Cancer02/BobBeck.html"&gt;description&lt;/a&gt; of it should convince most readers of just what nonsense it is (although I do reserve the right to use it as more blog fodder in the future, as a detailed discussion may be worthwhile; perhaps a general post about a number of these devices):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bob Beck Protocol started out as an electromedicine treatment for AIDS / HIV, however, it has turned out to be a superb cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is certainly no other electromedicine treatment for cancer that is anywhere near as effective as the Bob Beck Protocol. It is far better than any Rife Machine, far better than any Multi-Wave Oscillator (MWO), far better than anything Hulda Clark has out, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason the Bob Beck Protocol is so absolutely superior to other electromedicine treatments is that it is the direct result of an incredible discovery in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two medical doctors, Dr. Kaali and Dr. Lyman, discovered, in 1990, that a small electric current could disable microbes from being able to multiply, thus rendering them harmless. It was, in fact, the greatest medical discovery in the history of medicine because virtually all diseases are caused by, or enhanced by, a microbe. Their discovery was a cure for almost every disease known to mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video can be found &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3451198977216830251"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which postulates something called “blood electrification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb, one that I have yet to find to have been wrong, is that, whenever someone says their device or treatment is a “cure for almost every disease known to mankind,” it’s quackery. Run, don’t walk, away from anyone telling you that. Moreover, when someone like Beck tells you that his therapy won’t work if you take any other therapy, be it conventional chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, or even any other “alternative” therapy, that’s just icing on the cake for identifying quackery. In any case, that gp believes in Beck’s protocol so strongly should tell you what’s coming next, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/the_woo_it_burns.php#comment-1449135"&gt;namely an anecdote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, my wife was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma (3.5 cm tumor) last year with metastatic lymph node activity, the lay translation of which is terminal breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I’m sorry that gp’s wife developed breast cancer, having just watched my mother-in-law die of the disease a mere three and a half weeks ago, my personal feelings won’t stop me from pointing out the misunderstanding of breast cancer here. Unless his wife had metastatic disease in distant sites other than the lymph nodes under her arms, she did not have “terminal” breast cancer. In fact, even if a lot of lymph nodes under her arm were positive for metastatic breast cancer, she would still be potentially curable. Granted, depending on the number of positive lymph nodes, gp’s wife could be as high as a stage IIIA or, if the primary tumor was considered inoperable due to extension to the chest wall, stage IIIB, but stage III breast cancer is still potentially curable. As I guide you through the rest of the testimonial, I’ll try to fill in what probably really happened based on educated guesses. You will see that what probably happened does not support the efficacy of the quackery pursued. But, before I do, let’s look at three questions in reading alt-med cancer testimonials that can, if answered properly, can be indicative that an “alternative” therapy might actually have value. &lt;a href="http://www.users.on.net/~pmoran/cancer/how_to_read_a_testimonial.htm"&gt;These questions&lt;/a&gt; were provided by our ever-intrepid commenter and occasional gadfly here around SBM, the retired Australian cancer surgeon Peter Moran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was cancer definitely present , as shown by reliable tests, when treatment was commenced?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did it go away?  (or clearly respond otherwise, as judged by the same tests)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was the advocated treatment the only one used ?  (within 2-3 months of the apparent cancer response)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus far, the answer to question number one appears to be “yes.” However, I would say that Dr. Moran’s list is incomplete in that I would add to it: Was sufficient reliable information presented in the testimonial to allow me to do a reasonably accurate staging of the tumor? In other words, if a person giving a testimonial says that the cancer was “incurable” with conventional therapy, was it, in fact, incurable? In this case, as I pointed out before, we can answer fairly confidently that gp’s wife’s cancer was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; incurable. It is possible, even likely, that it was a fairly nasty tumor (more on that later), but it does not appear to have been stage IV disease, because it’s a pretty safe bet that if it were gp would have pointed out that his wife had metastases to lung, liver, bone, or wherever, in order to emphasize the hopelessness of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue with gp’s testimonial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I interviewed and met with three separate cancer specialists including the head of oncology for a cancer research center in the top 10 worldwide; the answer to her cancer was an extensive regiment of cytotoxins followed by radiation, despite her heart tests which came back with less than 50% efficiency for her left ventricle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether gp’s wife’s axillary lymph nodes were positive or not, a 3.5 cm primary tumor would mandate at least some chemotherapy; positive lymph nodes would indicate the need for a longer and more intensive course of chemotherapy. In addition, radiation therapy is standard of care for any form of breast-conserving therapy. As I tell patients, if your breast stays in place, you need radiation. There are only a few exceptions. Without it, the risk of local recurrence can be as high as 30% or slightly more. Of course, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=10"&gt;as I’ve pointed out before&lt;/a&gt;, this very fact (namely that about 2/3 or more of women who undergo lumpectomy will do fine without radiation) often leads to other testimonials by women who have had a lumpectomy, eschewed radiation in favor of some alternative woo or other, and and then attributed their doing well not to the surgery, but rather to the woo. The same goes for chemotherapy. Remember, surgery is the main curative modality in breast cancer that is curable. Radiation is the icing on the cake that sharply decreases the risk of local recurrence, and chemotherapy reduces the risk of distant recurrence; i.e., recurrence outside of the breast or axillary lymph nodes, such as in the bone, liver, lung, or other organs. Finally, gp’s comment about his wife having “less than 50% efficiency” refers to a MUGA scan, which is indicated before the use of Adriamycin-based chemotherapy regimens, which can indeed injure the heart. Radiation to the left breast or chest wall can also “leak” and injure the heart, but the risk is very small with modern techniques of planning and advanced equipment aiming the beam, which now allow for very accurate radiation dosage, with little or no collateral damage.Clearly, Mrs. gp’s oncologists thought that her cardiac reserve was adequate to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gp continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally challenged each of her oncologists to a simple question and answer session about the mortality rates associated with chemotherapy used in conjunction with radiation; they were only able to cite the statistics published by the American Cancer Society which are now deceptively reported within a 5 year window (if there is no reoccurance of cancer within 5 calendar years, the patient is cured of cancer; if there is a reocurrance after the 5 year window, they are reclassified as a new patient). Her oncologists had not one suggestion for a change in her diet, a change in aerobic activity, or any solution other than the administration of very expensive cytotoxins followed by a 30 day bout of nuclear medicine, to further suppress and completely annihilate her immune system to get the cancer out of her. Napalm for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason doctors have no suggestions other than generic suggestions is because there is no evidence that specific dietary interventions can treat an established cancer. There is, of course, that diet can influence our risk for cancer, and there is even weak and controversial evidence that an extremely low fat diet might be able to slow the progression of very early stage prostate cancer with favorable histology, but that is a far cry from treating an established cancer. Moreover, one can’t help but note that gp is parroting the usual alt-med tropes about cancer therapy, including the classic “poisoning” and “burning” (although I’ve never seen anyone refer to it as “napalm for humans” before), in addition to the exaggerated fears of “annihilating” the immune system. In fact, the immune system recovers quite well from breast cancer chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for gp’s claim that the American Cancer Society has somehow jiggered its statistics on survival, there’s no other way to put it, I’m afraid, other than that it’s nonsense. It is true that about five years ago the ACS &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.org/downloads/STT/PickleCFF2007.pdf"&gt;changed its statistical models&lt;/a&gt; for estimating the number of cancer cases and cancer deaths; this was done to reflect more accurately the incidence and number of deaths using the SEER database. It should also be remembered that the ACS state-by-state reporting of cancer incidence and deaths is not intended to estimate how successful treatments are, because it doesn’t break the data down stage by stage, treatment by treatment, but rather only by tumor type. Results of randomized clinical trials and other studies looking at stage-by-stage survival rates are required for this purpose, and such studies, I assure gp, do not count recurrences after 5 years of breast cancer as new cancers. Breast cancer is well known as a cancer that has a propensity to recur later than five years, which is why survival rates for breast cancer are often reported as ten year survivals. Indeed, from the landmark clinical trials in the 1970s and 1980s by the NSABP that now have 25 and 30 year survival rates reported. The literature on this subject is long and deep, and, even if the ACS were “jiggering” its figures in the way described by gp, it would not affect that literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer research center (Moffitt Research here in Tampa) has a McDonald’s in the lobby. I had a Big and Tasty with a large Coke each day while she was in the hospital recovering from the bi-lateral mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this we learn that gp’s wife had a bilateral mastectomy. It is not mentioned whether she also underwent an axillary dissection on the side of the tumor, but presumably she did if she had a positive lymph node there. No competent breast surgeon would be willing to do just a mastectomy under those circumstances without a fight. Indeed, if Mrs. gp had stage IV disease, it is also very highly unlikely that any surgeon would want to perform a bilateral mastectomy on her right off the bat. It is true that there is retrospective  evidence suggesting that removing the primary tumor in patients with metastatic disease might be helpful in terms of prolonging survival, but that’s only in patients who have stable disease after chemotherapy. Be that as it may, assuming Mrs. pg had a modified radical mastectomy on the side of the tumor (includes the lymph nodes) the answer to Peter’s second question is: Yes, the tumor did go away. You can’t make a non-stage IV cancer go away any more effectively than to remove both breasts. However, the tumor went away &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; any alternative therapy was tried, thanks to a trusty neighborhood surgical oncologist at Moffit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to know whether his wife chose a bilateral mastectomy. Personally, as a breast surgeon, I am very reluctant to perform a mastectomy on the other side unless (1) there is another cancer there (which gp didn’t mention; so I presume that there wasn’t) or (2) a documented mutation in a gene like BRCA1 that predisposes to hereditary cancer. I admit that these days I’m a bit of a dinosaur that way, because increasingly women are demanding bilateral mastectomies, even though there is no evidence that their routine use improves survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, that Mrs. gp required a mastectomy implies that her surgeon judged her tumor too large to perform a lumpectomy or partial mastectomy with a decent cosmetic result. Another interesting wrinkle is that these days giving chemotherapy before surgery can often shrink such tumors to the size where lumpectomy is possible, allowing preservation of the breast. However, for this approach to work, the woman has to be willing to undergo both chemotherapy and radiation, and Mrs. gp was unwilling to accept either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then opted to decline chemotherapy (you will be dead within a year) as well as decline radiation (seriously, you are really dead within a year now, take the chemo and radiation you crazy person with cancer) and instead began the Beck Protocol based on Dr. Robert Beck’s open source schematics (the “quackery” referenced in the previous two posts) which he published in 2002, originally as a way of bulking up the immune system of individuals diagnosed with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where gp and his wife got the idea that chemotherapy and radiation would lead his wife to be dead within a year. Most breast cancers, even metastatic ones, don’t necessarily lead to death within a year. Median survival is in general over a year; so a significant number of women with metasatic breast cancer live longer than a year. Some can even live several years. As for the Beck protocol, gp describes it thusly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the ozone generation component we opted for a clinical grade ozone generator and oxygen concentrator purchased from Longevity Resources; cancer itself is an anaerobic function so increasing blood/oxygen saturation is a key component to fighting cancer of any type. Ozone is used primarily in Europe as a disinfectant and has only recently been adopted by U.S. hospitals to disinfect operating rooms, burn units etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the blood electrification equipment we went with a vendor that replicated the work of Dr. Bob Beck’s open source schematics and in accordance with the research of Dr. Kaali and Dr. Lyman’s report from 1990, which is now the core focus of electroporation equipment (that curiously also uses the same square wave advocated by Rife’s research) now approved by the FDA and in clinical trials with cancer research centers here in the U.S. The unit I bought for the blood electrification is non-FDA approved, built to spec as described by Kaali/Lyman/Beck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the magnetic coil pulser I ordered a unit from Australia with measurable output according to the Beck Protocol, non FDA approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the silver component we went with 2 gallons of medical grade collodial silver from a supplier here in the U.S. with a lab certified 20 ppm content (Utopia Silver, http://www.utopiasilver.com).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also used a daily dosage of 60 bitter apricot pits initially (now a 20 pit per day maintenance routine) due to high concentrations of Laetrille/B17 (illegal for resale in the U.S. per the good folks at the FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goodness, the Beck protocol is a panoply of cancer quackery! It’s all there, even laetrile! Of course, there is one bit of possible non-woo in with all the woo, and that’s the electroporation equipment. Electroporation is sometimes used to potentiate DNA vaccines, to increase the uptake into the skeletal muscle cells of the plasmid DNA being used to immunize the patient. It does not surprise me that the device gp picked up is not FDA-approved. As for colloidal silver, apparently gp is unconcerned with what I like to call the “Blue Man syndrome” but what is more commonly called &lt;a href="http://RoseMaryJacobs.com"&gt;agyria&lt;/a&gt; that can occur as a result of its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let me just address the ozone issue. Apparently the idea is to increase the blood saturation of oxygen somehow by increasing the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood. The problem is that the vast majority of oxygen in the blood is bound to the hemoglobin in the red blood cells. Only a small minority of the oxygen in the blood is dissolved. Moreover, the oxygen binding curve for hemoglobin is saturable; if the hemoglobin is greater than 90% saturated (as it is in most people at sea level or near sea level), it’s impossible to increase the oxygen content of the blood by more than a couple of percent by adding more oxygen. Worse, ozone is a very strong oxidant. Did it ever occur to gp that there’s a reason it’s used as a disinfectant? It kills bacteria, but its oxydizing properties do exactly the same thing to normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did Mrs. gp do? Let’s see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her initial tumor markers were off the charts in all areas; after three months of treatment and her surgery, she scores 1 out of 40 for her tumor markers - and she refused chemotherapy or radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;a href="http://www.caprofile.net"&gt;http://www.caprofile.net/&lt;/a&gt; for bi-monthly blood tests that show her progress in terms of her cancer markers and the other empirical indicators of cancer (PHI enzyme levels, hCG levels, etc). We have to pay the $300 for this test out of pocket as insurance will not cover it; the blood tests from her oncologist (covered by insurance and 10X the costs) don’t even show the basic levels associated with cancer such as PHI and hCG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note what he says: &lt;em&gt;After the surgery&lt;/em&gt;. Of course her tumor markers fell. Remove the tumor, and the tumor markers will usually fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now’s as good a time as any to answer Peter’s third question, and the answer is a resounding “yes.” She &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; receive other therapy. She received the primary therapy for her tumor. In fact she received highly aggressive surgical therapy for her tumor. Once again, I reiterate: Chemotherapy and radiation in this setting are &lt;em&gt;adjuvant&lt;/em&gt; therapies. Surgery is the primary therapy, and they are useful for decreasing the risk of cancer recurrence. Back in the “old days” before there were effective adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy regimens, surgery was the only treatment for breast cancer, even relatively advanced tumors. The survival rate wasn’t fantastic, but a significant minority of women were cured of their cancers by surgery alone and still are. It is highly probable that gp’s wife falls into that category, although, at the risk of being pessimistic, I have to point out that we don’t know how far out she is from her surgery. She’s still not out of the woods yet by any means. I wish her only the best, but really wish she had increased her odds of overcoming breast cancer by accepting conventional treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the issue of all those “tumor markers.” The following of tumor markers for breast cancer is a complicated and controversial minefield. In fact, there are a number of tumor markers for breast cancer of wildly varying validity and reliability, the vast majority of which aren’t much good. Indeed, breast cancer tumor markers are in general not closely followed after primary surgery for breast cancer; rather they are sometimes followed in the case of advanced disease. Some oncologists I’ve known don’t follow them at all, thinking them to be a waste of time. Unfortunately, those of us who take care of breast cancer don’t have a marker as reliable as CEA is for colon cancer and would very much love to have one whose high degree of utility is science- and evidence-based. There’s a reason why insurance companies don’t pay for that many of them, and I can only guess at what other dubious markers gp was paying quacks to measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No testimonial, of course, would be complete without an appeal to emotion  and conspiracy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple, rational logic dictates that cellular toxins of any sort destroy the body’s ability to fight cancer, as does radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, rational logic also dictates that nuclear medicine is proven to cause additional forms of cancer and debilitating diseases, all of which are considered by modern day oncology as “effective” means of combating metastatic cancer which is now at epidemic levels worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, rational logic says that the body’s immune system is the first line of defense against any form of life threatening illness, and bolstering - not destroying - the body’s immune system is the most effective way of combating cancer of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Big Pharma and their minions at the FDA would rather allow corporate profit motives to drive cancer research, while only treating the symptoms of cancer and never the root causes of what causes cancer in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Simple, rational logic” is, alas, all too often only the former of the two based on a profound misunderstanding of biology. It is true that chemotherapy is toxic, but the point is that it’s &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; toxic to cancer cells that are rapidly dividing than it is to normal cells. The same thing is true of radiation when administered correctly. Indeed, the concept of “fractionating” radiation (i.e., giving it in small daily doses over 30 or so fractions, which is what is done with breast cancer) is predicated on the fact that normal cells can repair their DNA after such low doses but cancer cells can’t. The cancer cells thus accumulate damage, while normal cells repair themselves during the “rest” periods. Moreover, although it is true that secondary malignancies are a risk with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, numerous studies have been done on this issue, and it turns out that the risk of these secondary malignancies is far outweighed by the therapeutic benefit of the chemotherapy. The problem with so many mavens of alt-med is that they are like antivaccinationists in that they seem to think that there must be medical interventions with absolutely zero risk. All medical treatment is composed of a risk-benefit analysis. For a disease like cancer, which has the potential to kill, more risks are considered acceptable to wipe it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gp’s testimonial illustrates very well the inherently deceptive nature of the vast majority of alt-med cancer testimonials. This deception is rarely intentional; rather, far more commonly it is the result of a poor understanding of cancer, how it’s treated, its prognosis, and the extreme variability of its course. Indeed,  breast cancer is a disease with a particularly variable course, which, when coupled with its high degree of prevalence (it’s the most common cancer diagnosed in women), virtually guarantees large numbers of women who are “outliers,” doing much better than expected. Some of these women will take alternative medicine and attribute their good fortune to alternative medicine rather than their tumor biology. The reason that these testimonials often sound convincing is that the people listening to them are not physicians and do not know enough about the expected natural course of a specific cancer, how that cancer is normally treated. Another common misunderstanding is what the role of chemotherapy and radiation is for treating solid tumors, for which the primary treatment is almost always surgical and for which surgery can often be curative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, not how gp claims that “conventional medicine” treats “only the symptoms” of cancer rather than the “root cause.” This is a frequently claim made by alt-med advocates not just about cancer but about virtually all human disease. It is also one I consider most ironic, given that scientific medicine actually does try to discover the actual cause of cancer and treat it. It looks at genes, the functions of the proteins they express, and how the environment interacts with them. They study tumor biology and how seemingly “normal” stroma can influence the growth of tumors for good or ill. Science modifies its views in response to new data, observation, and experiments. The contrast with “alternative” medicine could not be more stark, where we false causes of cancer are identified and targeted: Liver flukes causing “all cancer”; vague disorders in unmeasurable “life energy”; unnamed “toxins”; uncharacterized immune system “weakness”; or, my favorite when it comes to inanity, the claim that cancer is not a disease at all, but rather a manifestation of internal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if gp or his wife sees this, no doubt they will see it as yet another example of a close-minded physician. However, I am a physician who sincerely hopes that Mrs. gp does not become like &lt;a href="http://www.users.on.net/~pmoran/cancer/BCtestimonial.htm"&gt;some women described by Peter Moran&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies &amp;lt;1,2&amp;gt;  that predict a favourable outcome for many with lumpectomy alone predict misery for others.  The women on the wrong side of the gamble, those trying to cope with  persistent cancer  either eventually have to accept further medical care, usually mastectomy, or can be observed making  fleeting visits  to their old Internet stamping grounds,  asking for advice  on what to do about the pain or smelly discharge, or regarding what last-ditch methods they should try, having by now used most of the treatments on offer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, some of these unfortunate women still fly the “alternative” flag, remaining proud that they have have “treated” their breast cancer “without using any conventional methods”.  This is a tribute to the occasional success of malicious propaganda  that claims, despite mountains of evidence to the contrary, that medical treatment of cancer doesn’t work or makes things worse.   The truth is that the prognosis for cure of breast cancer is very good, especially if found early via screening.   In fact,  even when all stages of the disease are included [4] 80% of  women with breast cancer survive for ten years, with most of these being cured permanently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also reminded that I’ve just returned home from a meeting in Phoenix, where I met a former fellow from my old program who now practices in nearby Scottsdale. She happens to have read this blog, and our discussion turned to the fact that Arizona is ground zero for a whole lot of woo, which led her to describe a couple of patients whom she’s seen in just a year and a half of practice with advanced, fungating tumors that had been treated by, as she put it, “naturopaths putting various salves on them.” I concluded that I would have a hard time practicing in Arizona, as in eight and a half years in New Jersey I had never seen such a case. I had seen neglected tumors due to denial, but I had never personally seen one treated by a naturopath. I was also reminded yet again that this sort of quackery kills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t believe me, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=15"&gt;go back and read this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A new one on me, but Google turns up about 100 hits for &lt;em&gt;strident progress&lt;/em&gt;, 50 or so for &lt;em&gt;strident advances&lt;/em&gt;, and almost 400 for &lt;em&gt;strident growth&lt;/em&gt;, the great majority of them suggesting simply "great" or "impressive," with no intimation of shrillness or unpleasantness:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, some of the most strident advances in technology overall have been in the arena of forecasting… (&lt;a href="http://www.cbs3springfield.com/weather/classroom/weatherteamarticles/15411526.html"&gt;CBS3&lt;/a&gt;, Springfield, Mass.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The failure of real gains to trickle down the income scale has been mitigated by… a strident expansion of public sector activities and the public funding of employment within the public and private sectors. (&lt;a href="http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:L2LDtYmbtIIJ:www.ercouncil.org/B%26O%252036.4.pdf+%22strident+expansion%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;cd=6&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;Economic Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, UK)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares are trading on about 23 times forecast 2007 earnings, but there is no sign that Capita's strident growth is likely to slow.

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few of the hits seem to be from Asian English-language  sources, but as the examples above show, the phenomenon is pretty widespread. And it goes back quite a while: a 1922 &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=91o1AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=toc&amp;amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#PPR9,M1"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of items by the famous &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; columnist Bert Leston Taylor includes the item&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just saw a news headline that read, “&lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090309/ap_on_re_us/church_shooting"&gt;Police:  Ill. pastor deflected gunshot with Bible.&lt;/a&gt;” I would love to hear the pastor, Fred Winters’ account of the proceedings except for 1 small problem. He’s dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pastor shot and killed during his Sunday sermon deflected the first of the gunman’s four rounds with a Bible. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the pastor was killed by the second shot, why is bullet-deflecting Bible given a headline? If the implication is meant to suggest a miracle occurred, let me be the first to say that that’s the worst miracle I’ve ever heard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What, is god Two Face from Batman? He flipped the coin and it landed on good heads, so he let the pastor deflect the bullet but  then flipped the coin again for the second bullet and it landed on bad heads?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, doesn’t a murder in church pretty much definitely debunk the notion that prayer works? There were 150 congregants. I mean really, doncha think there were plenty of people praying in the church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was god distracted? Certainly he intervened eventually, right? Nope. &lt;a href="http://unreasonablefaith.com/2009/03/08/illinois-pastor-shot-to-death-at-church/"&gt;The shooter was tackled to the ground by mere mortals&lt;/a&gt; who apparently proved more capable of thwarting this monster than god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barbara (Kitty) Mervine is a long-time friend of the JREF who is joining us on her second Amaz!ng Adventure. While she'll be enlightening those on board with tales of Mexican UFOs, she's taken time to point out some European assumptions concerning ancient American civilizations for those who missed the boat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The misconception that the native people of Mexico were incapable of having such advanced skills in architecture, math and astronomy started long before the Erich von Däniken wrote his infamous "Chariot of the Gods" book. When sixteenth- century Spanish historians wrote of the Mayan ruins, they concluded that the people that built the pyramids and other advanced architectural structures were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. Cotton Mather, William Penn and Roger Williams were all supporters of what was called the "Jewish Theory" for Mexico. Other theories to explain how such an advanced civilization ended up in Mexico include the Mayans being survivors of a lost continent such as Atlantis. In recent times we have space aliens coming to both Egypt and Central and South America to build landing pads and pyramids, and pass on their wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.randi.org/site/index.php?format=feed&amp;type=rss</id><title type="html">James Randi Educational Foundation</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/component/content/frontpage.html" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236571882061"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/marriage_divorce_autism_love">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dc3ae485198ea4ef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Marriage &amp;amp; Divorce, Autism &amp;amp; Love</title><published>2009-03-09T04:02:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T04:02:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/marriage_divorce_autism_love" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.grace-bible.org/Images/wedding_rings.jpg" height="130" alt="Wedding rings image from http://www.grace-bible.org/" style="float:left;border-color:initial;margin-top:0px;margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;border-width:1px;border-style:solid;padding:2px" width="180"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Over at &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1943"&gt;Left Brain/Right Brain&lt;/a&gt;, Dad of Cameron (Do'C) took a thorough look at the rumored "higher than average"---some cite a figure of 85%---divorce rate among parents of children on the autism spectrum. Noting that a number of bloggers (and Do'C kindly references &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/how-high-is-the-divorce-rate-among-autism-parents/"&gt;this Autism Vox post&lt;/a&gt;) have searched for and not found any substantial evidence supporting those high rates, and that the 85% figure seems to be "more and more like an internet urban legend," Do'C concludes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for me, I tend to think the actual divorce rate among autism families is probably pretty close to whatever the average is for all families. All families, and all marriages, have sources of difficulty, conflict, and compromise. They all have good too. Is there any reason to think that parents of ASD children are really that much different than most parents when it comes to divorce overall, one way or the other? So far, I haven’t seen any good scientific evidence to make me think so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Strain on families" and, too, "stress" are frequently noted as one of the effects of raising an autistic child on families, on the members of those families, and on the relationships among the members of those families. One way to depict the "awfulness of autism" is by saying that it's the reason---a child having autism is the reason---for families falling apart, for marriages breaking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clearly, highly personal topic. Just as it's often said that "if you've met on individual with autism, you've met one individual with autism," it's equally the case that "if you've met one family with a relative on the autism spectrum, you've met one family with a relative on the autism spectrum." What I have to say on this topic is incredibly, inevitably, personal, though I do think I can venture to say, in sympathy with other families, that it's not easy raising a child with a lot of challenges.; I'd also say that it's not easy for my son to manage living in a world that is not interested in understanding or accommodating for his differences. Jim and I have been through a lot in parenting Charlie, but we know that he goes through a great deal more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly I read the reflections on God, faith, autism and love of Pastor Craig Johnson in the March 9th &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/american_love/2009/03/09/pastor_craig/"&gt;Salon&lt;/a&gt; with great interest. Johnson writes about his marriage of 19 years to Sam; they have three children, Corey, Courtney, and Connor. When Corey was around 12 or 13, Johnson notes that he and his wife decided "that was gonna be it":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to go get a vasectomy on a Thursday. And then Sam called crying on the phone on Saturday and said she was pregnant. And our whole world just changed in that moment. Everything that we thought life was gonna be about completely shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, Connor responded just like any other baby.......&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connor is autistic and Johnson notes the different response in Sam and himself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, Sam was right there, maternal. That just seemed like that's how moms are built. She was just gonna hold him. The mother usually, automatically connects, and her life becomes that child. And Sam was the same way, connecting with parents through the Internet, and trying everything from diets to you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But dads connect emotionally. So I would say, "I love you Connor," and he would just look at me, or he would look away. I come from a family that hugs a lot and very expressive in how we feel. It was probably the most devastating thing that's ever happened to me. And dads, what they want is what guys try to do in general -- they want to give the answer, solve the problem and stuff like that. And when they can't necessarily solve the problem, and the mom is so engrossed in finding that cure, they pull back. A separation begins to happen and arguments begin to take place. And unfortunately, it's affecting families in such a huge way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've read this sort of observation about the difference in how some mothers respond on learning about a child's diagnosis, and about how some fathers do: Mothers sometimes throw themselves more than wholly in helping, treating, trying to "cure" a child; fathers sometimes, as Johnson writes, "pull back."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a generalization to distinguish between mothers and fathers, between the genders. I've known fathers who could outdo anyone in detailing the latest about &lt;a href="http://www.defeatautismnow.com"&gt;DAN!&lt;/a&gt; and mothers who preferred to step back and away from the situation. But generally the population at most of the autism conferences I've been to has been female; there's certainly &lt;a href="http://www.californiafather.com/"&gt;dads&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/"&gt;who blog&lt;/a&gt; (like Do'C) (and I'm hoping that Jim will be writing here someday, some post), though a good many blogs about autism seem to be by women (will there ever be a BlogHe/Him conference to match &lt;a href="http://www.blogher.com/"&gt;BlogHer&lt;/a&gt;?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Johnson was the executive pastor at a church in Los Angeles; he gets the call to go to Lakewood Church in Houston where &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Osteen"&gt;Joel Osteen&lt;/a&gt; is the pastor. A conversation with Osteen occurs around the time of Connor's diagnosis and Johnson notes in regard to his marriage that "I was determined never to walk backwards and experience death in this relationship"; that the feeling of "pulling back" he'd noted earlier "makes him feel desperate." He continues with a theme I've heard from more than a few families, and have to note in myself, that the experience of taking care of my son has made me love him, and my husband, even more. Writes Johnson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's kind of turned around for me and Sam, where what was originally pretty devastating has also been the greatest gift, because man, our love is so much deeper than I ever could imagine. I thought I loved pretty well [laughs]. But with Connor -- you celebrate every little moment. Every little time he kisses me or every little time I get a hug, you know -- we do this kiss with Connor. It's called the Connor sandwich and Sam kisses him on one side of the cheek and I kiss him on the other side. And when we do the Connor sandwich, man, that's just showing him we're right there -- we're gonna get through this together, and you're gonna live a good life. It's incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...............&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my kids have different challenges in their lives. Corey's going to have a different challenge, Courtney is going to have a different challenge. And Connor will have a different -- that's just life. That's just kids. And if I had a choice with Connor having autism or being strung out on drugs, let's say -- I mean -- is that any harder? Would I want that to happen to one of my children? Absolutely not. So I don't have to face those obstacles that other parents have to face, and they don't have to face some of the obstacles that I have to face. I just need to thank God for the blessing I have with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been more than a few times over the past ten years since we knew Charlie was autistic that Jim and I have become so focused, and over-focused, on Charlie, that we haven't focused enough at all on each other. It's not unsurprising: Charlie's needs have been such that, without constant efforts and energies devoted to him, we don't know where he would be. Jim and I both work full-time and not at all close (Jim especially) to where we live. We arrange our work schedules around Charlie's and each others. Even when we've been together, we're sometimes so worn-out or just tired or worrying about something at work that it's hard to communicate. We lived with Jim's parents for a year and that put a big strain on us, and not just because "living with one's in-laws is stressful"; both of my in-laws have psychiatric and other disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this life is keeping us plenty occupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Johnson, Jim and I know, and I think Charlie does, as he does, that "we're gonna get through this together," that &lt;em&gt;we're&lt;/em&gt; gonna live a good life, together. Things have been extremely tough at times but through it all, I know I love my guys more than ever, plus. Our "&lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/on_the_autismfront"&gt;tight team of three&lt;/a&gt;" is going to make it through the turmoils and travails, and still be walking together on the long road, holding each others' hands very tight.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236571496615"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd7a45cee2c94070</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Government Grants</title><published>2009-03-09T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/fraud/advancefee/grants.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Advertisements offer thousands of dollars of "free money" available in the form of government grants.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236571038770"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/08/the-envelope-please/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/50df28f78d741d45</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">The Envelope Please…</title><published>2009-03-09T03:54:50Z</published><updated>2009-03-09T03:54:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2009/03/08/the-envelope-please/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The results are in for the &lt;a href="http://fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/426"&gt;Foundational Questions Institute essay competition&lt;/a&gt; on “The Nature of Time,” which we discussed &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/11/24/what-if-time-really-exists/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  And the winners are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First Juried Prize: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/360"&gt;Julian Barbour on “The Nature of Time”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury panel admired this essay for its crystal-clear and engaging presentation of a problem in classical dynamics, namely to find a measure for duration or the size of a time interval. The paper argues lucidly, and in a historically well-informed manner, that an appropriate choice for such a measure is not to be found in Newton’s pre-existing absolute notion of time, but rather emerges, in the form of ephemeris time, from the observable motions and the assumption of energy conservation. The paper also suggests how this emergence of duration might be relevant to problems in quantum gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Juried Prizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;a href="http://www.fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/265"&gt;Claus Kiefer on “Does Time Exist in Quantum Gravity?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental problem in quantum gravity is that the “Wheeler-DeWitt Equation,” probably our most reliable equation of quantum gravity, does not refer to or even suggest anything like time or evolution. In this context time must emerge in the form of relations between a given system and some other system that may be considered a clock.  Kiefer beautifully reviews this problem, and argues how, via quantum “decoherence,” time as described by the usual Schroedinger equation in quantum mechanics can emerge from this timeless substratum, via entanglement between physical systems within space, and the spatial metric that controls motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) &lt;a href="http://www.fqxi.org/community/forum/topic/318"&gt;Sean Carroll on “What if Time Really Exists?”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on recent developments in string theory, Carroll impressed the panel with an exciting account of how a gravitating spacetime might in fact be just a holographic approximation to a more fundamental non-gravitating theory for which “time really exists.” Contemplating the difficulties raised by strange recurrences in an everlasting universe, he argues for a strong condition on the set of allowed quantum states that would disallow such repetitions. Carroll closes by attempting to reconcile this picture with recent observations that indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, with surprising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tied for second is not at all bad, considering the number of interesting entries.  There are more prizes, actually, as there are “community” awards as well as “juried” prizes, so check those out as well.  It’s pretty amusing that the top three essays all attack, in one way or another, whether or not the subject of the competition actually exists.  (I was in favor, the others were more skeptical.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the essays themselves, I very much appreciate the huge amount of work it must have been for the various judges to read through all of them and make hard decisions.  Thanks to the FQXi for sponsoring the contest, and thanks to all the judges for doing a great job!&lt;/p&gt;

The article is full of dishonest misquotes, but let&amp;#39;s zip right to Ray&amp;#39;s scientific misunderstandings. They are deep and painful. He has this bizarre idée fixe that the necessity of every species having males and females somehow greatly reduces the probability that new species could arise. It&amp;#39;s total nonsense, and I dismissed it briefly when I commented on it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know Ray is rather stupid, but who knew he could be that stupid. This has been explained to him multiple times: evolution does explain this stuff trivially. Populations evolve, not individuals, and male and female elephants evolved from populations of pre-elephants that contained males and females. Species do not arise from single new mutant males that then have to find a corresponding mutant female - they arise by the diffusion of variation through a whole population, male and female."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray has read that, and failed to grasp the central concept. Take a look at the workings of Ray Comfort's mind as he attempts to wrestle with a simple idea: the hamster wheel is wobbling, but the poor beast lies dead with legs up in its cage, and nothing is turning over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/elephantine_errors_from_ray_co.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/elephantine_errors_from_ray_co.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236553754045"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/aline-8oz-sr-flour-4oz-butter/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/20cea017be4b9cd7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">@aline 8oz sr flour 4oz butter…</title><published>2009-03-08T23:02:02Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T23:02:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/aline-8oz-sr-flour-4oz-butter/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;@aline 8oz sr flour 4oz butter 1.5tbsp sugar, 5floz milk, make soft dough, roll to 3/4″, cut to rounds, bake @425 for 12 mins !shortrecipes&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236552907153"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/twitter_made_me_lunch.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7224139ecd06715d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Food"/><title type="html">Twitter made me lunch.</title><published>2009-03-08T22:59:12Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T22:59:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/SJnepLRJV9I/twitter_made_me_lunch.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/twitter_made_me_lunch.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, in truth, I did all the preparation and cooking, so I guess technically I made myself lunch.

&lt;p&gt;Within moments of my Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What meal can I make from: broccoli, cabbage, kohlrabi, beets, carrots, spinach, lettuce, spring garlic, and lemon?

70 degrees Saturday in northern New Jersey: Obviously, Jim and Charlie go out for their inaugural March bike ride. It's nearing 2pm when they set out and, Charlie not yet having had lunch, Jim noted that maybe they'd stop for some along the way. Good idea, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the Mom and Dad perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Charlie perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No" to McDonalds when he and Jim pass it on their bikes. They pass a supermarket which has picnic tables for the workers on their breaks and Jim suggests they stop there; Charlie says "sushi" and then "no" about going in. They ride around some more and then back home. Charlie comes in for a cold drink and then goes back out and walks-rides his bike to put it away in the garage. And then, re-enters the house and says "I want."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You want......." Jim and I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple more "I want" 's, and a few prompts from us, it is clear that Charlie is very eager to get to the Golden Arches. He and Jim head to the car. "Makes sense," says Jim. "Got to get home, put away the bike, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; McDonalds....."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always glad to try out new perspectives in our house.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236549979800"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3037121837374317380">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/467ccbedc3b90153</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Finally, a Book that Educates the Masses: A Review of Bart D.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent Autism Omnibus decisions in the &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Hastings-Cedillo.pdf"&gt;Cedillo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Vowell.Snyder.pdf"&gt;Snyder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ftp://autism.uscfc.uscourts.gov/autism/vaccine/Campbell-Smith%20Hazlehurst%20Decision.pdf"&gt;Hazelhurst&lt;/a&gt; test cases have brought into sharp relief the differences between the “experts” on the vaccines-cause-autism “side” and the true experts who testified for the respondents.  Kathleen Seidel at &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/183/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurodiversity Weblog&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;has done her usual masterful job summarizing the decisions, if you’re not up to reading them in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think that the people who continue to blindly support the allegation that vaccines cause autism &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; read every word of these decisions, if only to counter the wild and conspiratorial stories spread by those people who have a financial and emotional stake in not letting this hypothesis die a quiet and well-deserved death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This information has been covered - in greater depth - by other ‘bloggers (see above as well as &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/184/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/02/will_2009_be_a_very_bad_year_for_antivac.php?utm_source=mostactive&amp;amp;utm_medium=link"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ), but what got me motivated to write this piece was a comment from a distraught parent (not one of the three families in the test cases). She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t see how we lost. I listened to all the testimony and I thought that our side had better experts and better science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I give &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; views, let me quote a few sentences from the legal decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Cedillo vs. HHS&lt;/em&gt;, Special Master Hastings had this to say about the evidence presented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…I concluded that the evidence was overwhelmingly contrary to the petitioners’ contentions. The expert witnesses presented by the respondent were far better qualified, far more experienced, and far more persuasive than the petitioners’ experts, concerning most of the key points. The numerous medical studies concerning these issues, performed by medical scientists worldwide, have come down strongly against the petitioners’ contentions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also made some specific comments, which show that he understood what many of the “vaccines-cause-autism” promoters do not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Corbier, like Dr. Kinsbourne and many of the respondent’s witnesses, did explain that the measles virus can in some instances cause injury or death in humans, in the form of disorders such as measles encephalitis, SSPE, etc. He seemed to then jump from that evidence to the conclusion that the MMR vaccine-strain form of the measles virus is capable of causing autism in a person with genetic susceptibility. But Dr. Corbier never persuasively explained how he can reasonably make that startling jump, in light of the fact that autism is a disorder quite different from measles encephalitis, SSPE, and the other disorders that are known to be caused by the measles virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Snyder vs. HHS&lt;/em&gt;, Special Master Vowell said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To conclude that Colten’s condition was the result of his MMR vaccine, an objective observer would have to emulate Lewis Carroll’s White Queen and be able to believe six impossible (or, at least, highly improbable) things before breakfast. The families of children with ASD and the court have waited in vain for adequate evidence to support the autism-MMR hypothesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence presented was both voluminous and extraordinarily complex. After careful consideration of all of the evidence, it was abundantly clear that petitioners’ theories of causation were speculative and unpersuasive. Respondent’s experts were far more qualified, better supported by the weight of scientific research and authority, and simply more persuasive on nearly every point in contention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the Special Masters - who listen to this sort of testimony all the time - weren’t convinced. In fact, Special Master Vowell had this to say about the petitioners “experts”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that the reports and advice given to the Cedillos by Dr. Krigsman and some other physicians, advising the Cedillos that there is a causal connection between Michelle’s MMR vaccination and her chronic conditions, &lt;strong&gt;have been very wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately, the Cedillos have been &lt;strong&gt;misled by physicians who are guilty, in my view, of gross medical misjudgment&lt;/strong&gt;. Nevertheless, I can understand why the Cedillos found such reports and advice to be believable under the circumstances. I conclude that the Cedillos filed this Program claim in good faith. [emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question then is &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the parents &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to be misled by the “experts”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in frequent contact with parents who “believe” that vaccines - in one way or another - caused their children’s autism. From this, I have come to realise that it is the &lt;em&gt;presentation&lt;/em&gt; of the information - rather than the information itself - that has led to (and continued) their belief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of parents who are involved in “alternative” or “biomedical” autism treatments mention that they were told by the diagnosing physician that “nothing can be done” about autism. Whether or not their recollection of the discussion is accurate, their &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; is that “mainstream” medicine didn’t offer “answers” that were satisfactory to them. All too often, the “alternative” practitioners have the “answers” these parents are looking for. The problem is that the “answers” aren’t correct - as the Special Masters noted above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it comes down to is that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people can’t tell when they are hearing the “straight scoop” on science and when they are hearing “Jabberwocky”. There is no shame in this. Everyone has their own areas of expertise and not everyone has the necessary education and experience to tell when they are being fed a line of…..fertiliser about biology and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average citizen cannot tell the difference between &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; science and something that merely &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like science. Some &lt;em&gt;doctors&lt;/em&gt; cannot tell the difference, having been unable or unwilling to keep up with scientific developments. But rather than admit to themselves that they don’t understand a word of what they are hearing, people fall back on their secondary method of telling if something is true or not - their &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt; about how trustworthy the speaker is; how &lt;em&gt;persuasive&lt;/em&gt; they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that some people are very &lt;em&gt;persuasive&lt;/em&gt; even when they aren’t being &lt;em&gt;trustworthy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of all the rich people - presumably very “smart” about financial matters - who invested money with Bernie Madoff. It wasn’t his investment strategy that convinced them to give him &lt;em&gt;billions&lt;/em&gt; to invest - he didn’t &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; them his investment strategy - it was his &lt;em&gt;personality&lt;/em&gt; that convinced them (and his reputation). He &lt;em&gt;persuaded&lt;/em&gt; them - against what &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be their better judgement - to &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, it is the personality - and the apparent confidence - of the “alternative” practitioners that leads people to “believe” in them, even when they don’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; understand what they say. The irony is that these same practitioners often tell the parents to not “believe” what anyone else says. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what makes it so hard to convince the parents that they’ve been misled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read the transcripts of the expert testimony during the Autism Omnibus Proceedings, it was clear to me that the petitioners’ experts were not just &lt;em&gt;unpersuasive&lt;/em&gt;, they were &lt;em&gt;uninformed&lt;/em&gt;. Many of them are intelligent people who have done good work in their fields (some are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;), but their conclusions were at odds with the data and what we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; about biology. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; biology and/or medicine, the nonsense and contradictions in the petitioners’ experts’ testimonies were as obvious as if someone had talked about a “touchdown” during a baseball game or if they said, “The square root of orange is turquois.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; why they lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They lost because the Special Masters could tell the difference between &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; science and Jabberwocky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

That actually makes the whole charade pretty easy to unmask.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have to examine every particular scientific or pseudo-scientific argument that will be advanced during the conference (&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2008/07/how_to_talk_to_a_sceptic.php"&gt;that&amp;#39;s been done repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;), because the whole &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority"&gt;thrust&lt;/a&gt; of this conference is about &lt;strong&gt;who&lt;/strong&gt; is attending, not what they are saying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click the Grist link for an examination of the main speakers.  You may not be surprised to learn that most of them are clearly in the “fake expert” category – people mostly with credentials, but not in climate science.  Exceptions to the “wrong credentials” list would be &lt;a href="http://www-eaps.mit.edu/faculty/lindzen.htm"&gt;Richard Lindzen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.drroyspencer.com/"&gt;Roy Spencer&lt;/a&gt;, who are both actual climate scientists.  Well, fair enough, but a couple of qualified contrarians is hardly “70 of the world’s elite scientists”.  In any case, it seems these two may not be totally in the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) isn’t happening camp anyway:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While these two legitimate climate scientists express doubt about the dangers of climate change, they both acknowledge that the world is warming and that it is due to human activity, primarily greenhouse gas emissions. Actually, this puts them at odds with most of their fellow panelists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have to say, that was news to me.  I haven’t really been following Lindzen’s work recently.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, if you scroll down the list of speakers, you’ll see that our old friend Joanne Nova is there.  Talk about fake experts.  Her bit is entitled “The Great Global Fawning: How Science Journalists Pay Homage to Non-Science and Un-Reason”.  Imagine having paid money to listen to that.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And for those determined to misunderstand anything written on this subject (and you know who you are), the above is not ad hominem – is is merely a rebuttal to the “more than 70 of the world’s elite scientists” appeal to authority claimed by the conference.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While writing on this subject, a quick response to “the IPCC is a political organization” ad hominem, favorite dismissal if the IPCC by the AGW skeptics.  Here is a &lt;a href="http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/%7Eprall/climate/AR4wg1_authors_table.html"&gt;list of all 619 authors Working Group I of the recent IPCC report&lt;/a&gt;.  This group&amp;#39;s section covers the scientific basis, and lays the foundation for the rest of the report.  Included are links to the authors’ personal homepages, a link to a Google Scholar search for their research, citation counts, degree information, Wikipedia links, affiliations and notes about declarations or petitions they have signed.  Hat tip for this to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/illconsidered/2009/02/excellent_compilation_of_ipcc.php"&gt;A Few things Ill Considered&lt;/a&gt;.  And again, for those determined to misunderstand anything written on this subject (and you still know who you are), this list is not an appeal to authority, I present it merely to debunk the “the IPCC is a political organization” ad hominem canard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236543412475"><id gr:original-id="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diversity_and_disability_art_and_education_event">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fc0f87dcc3b1f7ff</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Diversity and Disability, Art and Education Event</title><published>2009-03-08T20:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T20:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/diversity_and_disability_art_and_education_event" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/the-o/2481773708/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3280/2481773708_6375d9d788_m.jpg" alt="a rainbow from a spray of water over a city street, in the background a series of similar brick row-houses" style="float:left;margin:10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In Asheville, North Carolina, a cross disability rights and awareness event is being held.  On the arts side, the photography exhibit &lt;a href="http://citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009903080328"&gt;Road to Freedom: Portraits of People with Disabilities&lt;/a&gt; is being shown along with local artists with disabilities in all media, including autistic violinist Ben Mason.  At the art event, there will also be an assistive technology demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the education side, the local university UNC Asheville is running &lt;a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009903080329&amp;amp;source=rss"&gt;a series of talks related to disability rights&lt;/a&gt;, including a representative from Autism Society of North Carolina who "will guide a discussion on the complexity of autism and Autism Spectrum Disorder." What the ultimate content and quality of such a discussion will be is not clear, but hopefully it will share in some way the celebration of diversity and tolerance message of the art show.  Some of the other talks do seem specifically focused on disability rights, for example the site coordinator for the local Center for Independent Living who "will discuss the history and philosophy of disabilities and independent living."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road to Freedom is from &lt;a href="http://www.familydiv.org/roadtofreedom.php"&gt;Family Diversity Projects&lt;/a&gt;, which has created "six award-winning traveling rental photo-text exhibits that tour communities," and their mission is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;By educating people of all ages to recognize, support, and celebrate the full range of diversity, our traveling exhibits are designed to help reduce prejudice, stereotyping, and harassment of all people who are perceived to be "different" from the "norm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other diversity photo-text exhibits deal with race, sexual orientation, mental illness, and gender.&lt;/p&gt;

This week, I've been dealing with a particularly annoying jerk, who's been bothering me for multiple reasons. First, he wants me to "lay off" the Christians (because if I don't, God's gonna get me). Second, he wants to convince me to become a Christian. And third, he wants to sell me on his brilliant new compression scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; See, aside from the religious stuff, he's a technical visionary. He's invented a method where he can take a source document, and &lt;em&gt;repeatedly&lt;/em&gt; compress it, making it smaller each time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This is a stupid idea that I've seen entirely too many times. But instead of just
making fun of it, I thought it would be interesting to explain in detail why it doesn't work. It touches on a bunch of basic facts about how data compression works, and provides a nice excuse for me to write a bit about compression.



&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/upload/2009/03/i_get_mail_iterative_compressi/basic-compression.png" width="319" height="272" alt="basic-compression.png"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt; The basic idea of data compression is that you're eliminating redundancies in the original
text. You can't discard information. Mathematically, a compression function is an
&lt;em&gt;invertible&lt;/em&gt; function C from an array of characters to an array of characters (or you
could use bits if you prefer), such that if y=C(x), then &lt;em&gt;on the average input&lt;/em&gt;, the
length of y is smaller than the length of x.&lt;/p&gt; An &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; compression system is one
where for all possible values of x, C(x) is shorter than x. C is your compressor; and since C
is reversible, it has a unique inverse function C&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; such that C&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(C(x))
= x. An illustration of this basic compression system is in the diagram to the side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/i_get_mail_iterative_compressi.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2009/03/i_get_mail_iterative_compressi.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/wRTjufGIUvk" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236542949180"><id gr:original-id="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/made-scones-and-toffee-with-ai/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a702c0161d2ec04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Asides"/><title type="html">made scones and toffee with ai…</title><published>2009-03-08T20:04:13Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T20:04:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog/archives/2009/03/made-scones-and-toffee-with-ai/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;made scones and toffee with aidan, first time I used my candy thermometer&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>lambic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.lambic.co.uk/blog/feed/</id><title type="html">Be Lambic or Green</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://lambic.co.uk/blog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236541299048"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1214">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44aade05a6e20d78</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Speech-acts"/><title type="html">National welcomes</title><published>2009-03-08T19:41:46Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T19:41:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1214" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of your first sense of what a country is like comes from what is said to you by the first person you meet as you cross the border and present yourself to passport control.  I wonder if immigration officers realize just how large the effects of their speech acts (or lack thereof) can be. When my friend Polly and I crossed from Finland into Russia by train a few years ago, the skinny young men in military uniforms who boarded the train looked fierce and suspicious.  They demanded our passports and took them away with unpleasant scowls.  Returning them silently twenty minutes later, they wore expressions that seemed to say, "We found nothing, but you look undesirable, and it makes us angry that we have to admit scum like you to defile our great country."  Russia seems like a truly unwelcoming place.  By contrast, coming back into Finland from Russia a few days later we were met by relaxed and friendly passport officials who took a quick glance at our passports, handed them back with a warm smile, and said: "Welcome to Finland!"  A small courtesy, costing nothing, but after Russia it made Finland seem a totally wonderful place.  Even Finland, however, was topped by Scotland this morning, when I returned bleary-eyed to the Edinburgh airport having flown straight through from Taiwan via Bangkok and Amsterdam.  I handed over my passport, open at the page with the photo and date of birth, and the woman behind the desk glanced at it very quickly and slapped it down on the glass of the scanner.  And while she waited a couple of seconds for the machine to read the data, she looked at me with a twinkle in her eye and said, "Happy birthday."&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

A few book updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) This month, a guest post by Jeff Mark, author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Christian-More-Christianity-Debunking-Freethinking/dp/0981631304"&gt;Christian No More&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) April 2, a guest post by Eric Maisel, author of &lt;a href="http://theatheistsway.com/"&gt;The Atheist’s Way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the fold, some interesting books I saw in the book section of my local paper this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Darwins-Sacred-Cause-Slavery-Evolution/dp/0547055269"&gt;Darwin’s Sacred Cause: How a Hatred of Slavery Shaped Darwin’s Views on Human Evolution&lt;/a&gt; by Adrian Desmond and James Moore. From Amazon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;An astonishing new portrait of a scientific icon&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;In this remarkable book, Adrian Desmond and James Moore restore the missing moral core of Darwin’s evolutionary universe, providing a completely new account of how he came to his shattering theories about human origins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has always been a mystery surrounding Darwin: How did this quiet, respectable gentleman, a pillar of his parish, come to embrace one of the most radical ideas in the history of human thought? It’s difficult to overstate just what Darwin was risking in publishing his theory of evolution. So it must have been something very powerful—a moral fire, as Desmond and Moore put it—that propelled him. And that moral fire, they argue, was a passionate hatred of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make their case, they draw on a wealth of fresh manuscripts, unpublished family correspondence, notebooks, diaries, and even ships’ logs. They show how Darwin’s abolitionism had deep roots in his mother’s family and was reinforced by his voyage on the &lt;em&gt;Beagle&lt;/em&gt; as well as by events in America—from the rise of scientific racism at Harvard through the dark days of the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading apologists for slavery in Darwin’s time argued that blacks and whites had originated as separate species, with whites created superior. Darwin abhorred such “arrogance.” He believed that, far from being separate species, the races belonged to the same human family. Slavery was therefore a “sin,” and abolishing it became Darwin’s “sacred cause.” His theory of evolution gave &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the races—blacks and whites, animals and plants—an ancient common ancestor and freed them from creationist shackles. Evolution meant emancipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this rich and illuminating work, Desmond and Moore recover Darwin’s lost humanitarianism. They argue that only by acknowledging Darwin’s Christian abolitionist heritage can we fully understand the development of his groundbreaking ideas. Compulsively readable and utterly persuasive, &lt;em&gt;Darwin’s Sacred Cause&lt;/em&gt; will revolutionize our view of the great naturalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hallina.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why We Make Mistakes&lt;/em&gt; will open your eyes to the reasons behind your mistakes–and have     you vowing to do better the next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We forget our passwords. We pay too much to go to the gym. We think we’d be happier if we lived in California (we wouldn’t), and we think we should stick with our first answer on tests (we shouldn’t). Why do we make mistakes? And could we do a little better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We human beings have design flaws. Our eyes play tricks on us, our stories change in the retelling, and most of us are fairly sure we’re way above average. In &lt;em&gt;Why We Make     Mistakes&lt;/em&gt;, journalist Joseph T. Hallinan sets out to explore the captivating science of human error–how we think, see, remember, and forget, and how this sets us up for wholly irresistible mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his quest to understand our imperfections, Hallinan delves into psychology, neuroscience, and economics, with forays into aviation, consumer behavior, geography, football, stock picking, and more. He discovers that some of the same qualities that make us efficient also make us error prone. We learn to move rapidly through the world, quickly recognizing patterns–but overlooking details. Which is why thirteen-year-old boys discover errors that NASA scientists miss—and why you can’t find the beer in your refrigerator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why We Make Mistakes&lt;/em&gt; is enlivened by real-life stories–of weathermen whose predictions are uncannily accurate and a witness who sent an innocent man to jail–and offers valuable advice, such as how to remember where you’ve hidden something important. You’ll learn why multitasking is a bad idea, why men make errors women don’t, and why most people think San Diego is west of Reno (it’s not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Mark Twain once observed, “A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.” His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus public-health scares circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas–business people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and others–struggle to make their ideas “stick.”
&lt;p&gt;Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In &lt;em&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/em&gt;, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions. Inside, the brothers Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the “human scale principle,” using the “Velcro Theory of Memory,” and creating “curiosity gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this indispensable guide, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds–from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony–draw their power from the same six traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made to Stick &lt;/em&gt;is a book that will transform the way you communicate ideas. It’s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures)–the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of “the Mother Teresa Effect”; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice. Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, &lt;em&gt;Made to Stick&lt;/em&gt; shows us the vital principles of winning ideas–and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.     &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In this case, environmental differences cause changes in the patterns of expression of genes, and these alterations can sometimes be passed on through at least a few generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two reasons why it is inaccurate to consider this kind of change in heritable characteristics induced by the environment as "Lamarckian inheritance".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One, Lamarck did not think that the environment imposed direct effects on organisms that were then passed on.  He argued that the environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less, that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated, and that this difference was then inherited by offspring.  As he wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now necessary to explain what I mean by this statement: The environment affects the shape and organization of animals, that is to say that when the environment becomes very different, it produces in the course of time corresponding modifications in the shape and organization of animals. It is true, if this statement were to be taken literally, I should be convicted of an error; for, whatever the environment may do, it does not work any direct modification whatever in the shape and organization of animals. [Translated as in &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d3112864qp640568/"&gt;Kampourakis and Zogza (2007)&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;What people insist on dubbing "Lamarckian inheritance" in the context of epigenetics is actually closer to the view held by Darwin than by Lamarck.  In the second part of his &lt;a href="http://www.linnean.org/index.php?id=380"&gt;1858 joint paper&lt;/a&gt; with Wallace (excerpted from an 1857 letter to Asa Gray), Darwin wrote,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Selection acts only by the accumulation of slight or greater variations, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;caused by external conditions&lt;/span&gt;, or by the mere fact that in generation the child is not absolutely similar to its parent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now take the case of a country undergoing some change. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;This will tend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary slightly&lt;/span&gt;—not but that I believe most beings vary at all times enough for selection to act on them. Some of its inhabitants will be exterminated; and the remainder will be exposed to the mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which I believe to be far more important to the life of each being than mere climate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;We can read similar things in the &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;amp;itemID=F373&amp;amp;pageseq=149"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations—so common and multiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in those in a state of nature—had been due to chance. This, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences, or very slight deviations of structure, as to make the child like its parents. But the much greater variability, as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities, under domestication or cultivation, than under nature, leads me to believe that &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;deviations of structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions of life, to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several generations&lt;/span&gt;. I have remarked in the first chapter—but a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the truth of the remark—that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; and to this system being functionally disturbed in the parents, I chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring. The male and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new being. In the case of "sporting" plants, the bud, which in its earliest condition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule, is alone affected. But why, because the reproductive system is disturbed, this or that part should vary more or less, we are profoundly ignorant. Nevertheless, we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light, and we may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of structure, however slight.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Two, the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics predates Lamarck, was the dominant view in his time, and remained common long afterward.  As &lt;a href="https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/1357/1/V04N02_025.pdf"&gt;Morse (1903)&lt;/a&gt; wrote,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Jean Lamarck first used the term "acquired character" to designate characters such as these and to him are are we to look for the first clear statement of the case.  By this it is not to be understood that the idea of the transmission of acquired characters arose with Lamarck.  No great generalization ever arose or ever can arise with one man alone.  The attribution of the idea of the transmission of acquired characters to Lamarck falls in the same category as attributing evolution to Darwin.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1005592"&gt;Zirkle (1946)&lt;/a&gt; was more forceful yet,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What Lamarck really did was to accept the hypothesis that acquired characters were heritable, a notion which had been held almost universally for well over two thousand years and which his contemporaries accepted as a matter of course, and to assume that the results of such inheritance were cumulative from generation to generation, thus producing, in time, new species.  His individual contribution to biological theory consisted in his application to the problem of the origin of species of the view that acquired characters were inherited and in showing that evolution could be inferred logically from the accepted biological hypotheses.  He would doubtless have been greatly astonished to learn that a belief in the inheritance of acquired characters is now labeled "Lamarckian," although he would almost certainly have felt flattered if evolution itself had been so designated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Darwin, like Lamarck, invoked use and disuse and inheritance of acquired changes&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Origin &lt;/span&gt;includes an entire &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;amp;itemID=F373&amp;amp;pageseq=152"&gt;section&lt;/a&gt; on it, the first part of which reads,&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effects of Use and Disuse&lt;/em&gt;.—From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited.&lt;/span&gt; Under free nature, we can have no standard of comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals have structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of South America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck. As the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any of the smaller quadrupeds. We may imagine that the early progenitor of the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of its body, its legs were used more, and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As was argued by &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v85/n2154/abs/085474b0.html"&gt;Parkyn (1911)&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is difficult to understand how anyone well acquainted with Darwin's works can come to any other conclusion than that he firmly believed in Lamarck's principle of the transmission of characters acquired by use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Designating epigenetics as Lamarckian greatly misconstrues what Lamarck actually argued.  The parts of Lamarckian theory to which it does refer were likewise part of early Darwinian theory.  In short, there is no vindication of Lamarck's mechanism to be granted by epigenetics.  That said, there is no doubt that Lamarck's contributions to evolutionary thinking should be better appreciated.  Certainly, the first step toward this would be an effort to understand what he actually proposed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;______________&lt;br&gt;Updated notes:&lt;br&gt;1) See the comments discussion.  Wilkins has pointed out that Darwin was not simply a "Lamarckian" in terms of new traits arising through need+use/disuse (rather, he suggested that the strength of inheritability of traits is affected by use).  However, Darwin did invoke disuse as a reason that traits could be lost which is enough to show that he did not throw out use and disuse as a mechanism of trait change.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/3286249888310401017-4213737392918611099?l=genomicron.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/O1JLyX8_Pvw" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236533977475"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/08/seeking-legendary-bad-astronomy/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d9fa1d411f5105c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Debunking"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Seeking legendary bad astronomy</title><published>2009-03-08T17:26:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T17:26:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/08/seeking-legendary-bad-astronomy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, what’s wrong with this picture?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2009/03/legendoftheseeker.jpg" alt="Legend of the Seeker still frame"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: Aaaaiiiiieeeee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, first, a little background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crescent Moon can be a stunning sight. It hangs near the Sun after sunset (or before sunrise), up in the west (or east) while people are still out and about. The shape itself is lovely, and it shines a pearly white in the deepening blue sky… and sometimes you can see the &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; part of the Moon as well, softly glowing with reflected Earthlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet for all its beauty, and its position both in time and in the sky making it obvious and well-observed, people still seem to massively screw up their understanding of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I give you the program &amp;quot;Legend of the Seeker&amp;quot;, the progenitor of that screen capture above, a fantasy series I had never even heard of until BABloggee Tom Elmer pointed it out to me. And why would he torture me so? So I can rail and froth about that picture depicted above, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/58936/legend-of-the-seeker-home"&gt;watch the scene yourself&lt;/a&gt; (note: that’s a link to Hulu, which I think is still only available inside the US; if that link takes you to the wrong episode it’s the 12th one of the first season). Don’t bother watching the whole thing (thank me later for that), but instead go to the 11 minute mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scene, Zedd, a wizard (you can tell from his hair) and the fair damsel Kahlan are schwitzing over an cursed boy. They have to break the spell, of course, but the sage says there is a deadline… they have to do it before the Moon covers three bright stars in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course! If I had a dollar for every time that’s happened to me, I could afford a stylish haircut like Zedd’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, take a look at the screen shot again. See the problem? Think on this: in the script, Zedd says, &amp;quot;Do you see how one star is beginning to disappear behind the Moon?&amp;quot; And you can clearly see that one of the three stars is very close to the edge of the lit crescent part of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a basic astronomical fact: &lt;em&gt;the Moon is a solid, opaque sphere&lt;/em&gt;. With me so far? Good. So when we see it as a crescent, it’s because we can only see a small part of the Moon that’s being lit by the Sun (&lt;a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/java/MoonPhase.html"&gt;we’re seeing that part from a shallow angle&lt;/a&gt;), and not because the Moon is physically like a slice of watermelon with a bite taken out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when the Moon is a crescent, the dark part is just unlit Moon, and not a scoop taken out of it. The only way to see stars superposed on the dark part of the Moon would be for the stars to be &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; the Moon and the Earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the Sun — &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/03/ten-things-you-dont-know-about-the-sun/"&gt;which is a star, you may recall&lt;/a&gt; — is 1.4 million kilometers across, and the Moon is only 400,000 km away, so you may see the problem here. Given that the Moon is the closest astronomical object in the sky, and the nearest star besides the Sun is &lt;strong&gt;100 million times farther away&lt;/strong&gt;, you might understand that any star we see would be &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; the Moon, not in front of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there’s no way to get stars between us and the Moon so that we see them against the dark part of the Moon. Of course, &amp;quot;Legend&amp;quot; is fantasy, so maybe in that universe stars are really really dinky. And close. And tied to mysterious curses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a bigger mystery here: why does the fair damsel Kahlan &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/25/comicon-eternal/"&gt;look so much like Jessica Stover&lt;/a&gt;, who is also making a fantasy  movie, and who also once asked me about phases of the Moon — which is in fact how we met?! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My iPhone, which was working just fine last night and which still seems on the surface to be working fine is behaving most strangely. My wife tried to call me, but I couldn't pick up because it happened to be while I was on my way through security. So I called her back, and, while I could hear her, she couldn't hear me (although on one attempt it seemed that I couldn't hear her either). 3G and Edge networks both work fine for surfing the net, sending and receiving calls (except for the fact that the person on the other end apparently can't hear me), sending and receiving e-mail and text messages, and everything else. No physical trauma occurred that might have broken the phone, at least not as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only oddity that I noted was that when I rebooted the phone this morning it failed to reboot and came up with a strange error message. Then I rebooted it again, and all seemed fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird. Has anyone ever had this happen before? Is it software, hardware, or AT&amp;amp;T? I guess all I can hope is that it&amp;#39;s OK when I get back home or that it can be fixed by resetting the phone to factory settings and reinstalling the software. Otherwise, it&amp;#39;s off to the AT&amp;amp;T Store tomorrow after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can Orac survive being cut off from the hivemind for that long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the webcomic Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, and recently artist Zach Weiner &lt;a href="http://themanitoban.com/science-technology/q-zach-weiner-creator-saturday-morning-breakfast-cereal"&gt;gave an interview to The Manitoban&lt;/a&gt; about combining the funny with the science. Here’s an excerpt to convince you to go read the whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
M.: Maybe your comics aren’t the best example, but do you think that science humour can get people interested in science and inspired to do science?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z.W.: To some extent. I think the way in which that works is less about inspiration and more about club mentality. I’m sure there are kids who read XKCD and really wanted to get the programming jokes, so they think “How cool would it be if I were a kid who understood all these jokes” and I think that’s motivating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I just switched the blog over to Daylight Savings Time, which always results in a tiny amount of comment-order weirdness.

&lt;p&gt;Why are we so hung up on killer rocks from space? I can think of lots of answers to that question: we’re fascinated by disaster in general, asteroid impacts are very dramatic and scary, they’re associated with dinosaurs (which are also cool), and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the near passage of the tiny asteroid &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/01/100-meter-asteroid-will-pass-earth-monday/"&gt;2009 DD45&lt;/a&gt; the other week, the New York Times asked several scientists and science writers what they thought about this question. &lt;a href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/the-lure-of-rocks-from-outer-space/"&gt;The answers, in the form of pretty interesting essays, are now online&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Reader Jake emailed me to share a pie recipe for me to prepare with the sprogs.  Writes Jake, &lt;i&gt;"This is one member of the extended family of molasses crumb pies and a cousin to the Pennsylvania Dutch Shoo-fly Pie. This recipe comes from my Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother, and when it comes out right (tends to vary a bit with relative humidity and barometric pressure) it is nowhere near as gooey or sickly sweet as most shoo-fly pies I've had. A cooled slice can be picked up with the fingers and eaten out of hand with no mess other than a crumb or two."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who spent half a dozen summers of my life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, I'm happy to make the acquaintance of a less gooey, less sickly sweet pie from the shoo-fly lineage.  As a bonus (yeah, I'm talking to you, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/pi_day_pie_2_i_want_to_taste_s.php#comment-1449573"&gt;jc&lt;/a&gt;), the recipe doesn't call for any ingredient more exotic than molasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the recipe, with our commentary on the preparation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/pi_day_pie_3_schnockaschtettle.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/pi_day_pie_3_schnockaschtettle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~4/dIJ1HFGx-jg" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience</id><title type="html">Adventures in Ethics and Science</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236523354771"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/links_for_2009-03-08.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/42860f2b742f7eba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linkfest"/><title type="html">links for 2009-03-08</title><published>2009-03-08T13:03:48Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T13:03:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/scienceblogs/ethicsandscience/~3/cIMBGXLqaGI/links_for_2009-03-08.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2009/03/links_for_2009-03-08.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/" type="html">&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite several rounds of chemotherapy and the best treatment available, her cancer has not regressed and the future does not look good. So, understandably, she is desperate - just the type of person likely to fall victim to unconventional treatments. She has previously been a victim of hair analysis, where she was told tomatoes were the cause of her problems and she could drink gin but not red wine (ridiculous). I previously blogged about hair analysis &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2008/12/07/science-under-siege-the-deliberate-hijacking-of-real-science-by-alternative-medicine/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.wordpress.com/2008/12/23/woo-woo-jumps-on-the-hair-analysis-drug-testing-bandwagon/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight she had a new magic treatment to tell my Mum about - the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_Machines"&gt;Vega machine&lt;/a&gt;. This thing is so good it can analyse the type of bacteria in your gut by placing an electrode between the toes of your right foot. My Mum called me on the way home to ask me if it was BS. Of course, I strongly suspected immediately that it was, but to be sure in two clicks of a mouse and a 30 sec Google search I was found to be correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:242px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/vega-zoom.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin-left:5px;margin-right:3px" title="vega-zoom" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/vega-zoom-300x225.jpg" alt="Vega - the biggest star in the constellation of Lyra. Unlike the Vega machine, a spectacular sight, not a spectacular rip-off." width="232" height="173"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vega - the biggest star in the constellation of Lyra. Unlike the Vega machine, a spectacular sight, not a spectacular rip-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Vega machine or Vega test?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apparatus consists of a box containing a galvanometer which compares the resistance between the skin in contact with a hand electrode and the skin tested with a measuring stylus. The other contents of the box are an electrical source. For a more thorough explanation of the electronics behind the Vega machine see &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/vegatest.html"&gt;here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents claim; &lt;em&gt;“Over 120 substances which include common foods and drinks and environmental substances are tested during our consultation. The equipment we use is a bio-electronic analyzer which measures the body’s electrical resistance to these substances. If a substance is causing a problem then it there will be a dip or drop in body’s electrical resistance”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:227px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/food_sensitivity_vega_machi.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="food_sensitivity_vega_machi" src="http://scepticsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/food_sensitivity_vega_machi.jpg" alt="Food sensitivity vega machine" width="217" height="260"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vega food sensitivity machine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2003 &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series2/food_sensitivity_allergy_vega_tests.shtml"&gt;investigation by the BBC&lt;/a&gt; sent subjects to undergo Vega testing at different health food shops in the UK, and reported that test results varied from store to store. The report revealed that one subject was allergic to 33 different types of food, with only three being agreed upon by the testers across stores. Further, one reporter was told he needed to take a total of 20 different vitamins and minerals. But again, the testers couldn’t seem to agree and all three testers advised different supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the manufacturer, Health Screen International (HSL), were asked to explain themselves they said that the Vega machine is only about 70% accurate and “It does stretch the imagination how the Vega test works…But we have thousands of letters from people saying how much better they feel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh testimonials, of course. Any regular readers of this blog would know that testimonials do not constitute scientific evidence. The human mind is fallible, memories are remodelled and we sometimes inadvertently attribute an effect of one treatment when our body may have repaired itself naturally. Or we may have done something else to reverse the pain or illness. A red flag should always be raised if you come across a product or service that has no evidence for efficacy apart from testimonials. They are simply unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even earlier than the 2003 BBC investigation, a paper was published in the Medical Journal of Australia, which concluded this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; Vega testing (the Vega test method) is an unorthodox method of diagnosing allergic and other diseases. It has no established scientific basis and there are no controlled trials to support its usefulness. Vega testing may lead to inappropriate treatment and expense to the patient and community (1). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s what &lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/electro.html"&gt;Quackwatch have to say&lt;/a&gt; about the likes of Vega test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The devices described in this article are used to diagnose nonexistent health problems, select inappropriate treatment, and defraud insurance companies. The practitioners who use them are either delusional, dishonest, or both. These devices should be confiscated and the practitioners who use them should be prosecuted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At sceptics in the pub on Thursday evening, someone asked me what motivates me to do this stuff, especially since, as he put it, it is largely a thankless task. Well, this is part of the reason. Quacks making a quick buck from sick, vulnerable and desperate individuals really gets my goat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know my Mum’s friend - she’s much too vulnerable for me to explain that she is getting scammed. I can only hope that by educating other people like you dear reader, that we can avoid more harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—————————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postscript: Upon reflection, doesn’t this sound quite a lot like the K-test, &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2009/02/the-kymatika-k-test-and-lbc/"&gt;featured in LBC radio recently and criticised by Ben Goldacre on Bad Science&lt;/a&gt;? Whilst it’s not exactly the same, Kymatica still use the food allergy line, but claim to be able to tell the difference between allergies and resistance, which they explain&lt;a href="http://www.kymatika.com/resistance-and-sensitivities"&gt; with a lot of jargon about IgG and IgE&lt;/a&gt; antibodies. Ooooh, sciencey!&lt;/p&gt;

One researcher said, well, we’ve been taught science for 20 years, surely we’d know how teach it without needing any training.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a couple of years now, I’ve been trying to lose weight the old fashioned way.  Eat less, move more.  Today my personal trainer suggested this weight loss clinic that uses some foam wrapping and infrared lasers.  My trainer said she’d tried it and it works and gave me the web site.  I’m looking over the website and I’m not buying it.  But I’m not that good of a skeptic and don’t know why I’m not buying it.  I just know, I’m not buying it.  Would the skeptics be so kind as to tell me why this doesn’t work?  Thanks, and I love the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.achievelaser.com/weight-loss.html"&gt;http://www.achievelaser.com/weight-loss.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. This is one of those websites that just overwhelms you with pseudoscientific technobabble. There is far too much nonsense here to tackle in a single blog, so I am going to focus on two claims - the low level laser therapy (LLLT) and the infrared body wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, for a little background, it’s interesting to note that spas have had a tradition for literally hundreds of years of promoting wellness (that is, there own financial wellnes) through pure BS. The basic marketing strategy is to convince people with disposable income and too sedentary a lifestyle to come in, relax, and passively receive exotic treatments that will cure whatever ails them. Spas have often been on the cutting edge of health pseudoscience. Today they incorporate the latest fads in CAM - from aromatherapy to reflexology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrared bodywrap is in the sweet-spot of the spa tradition - and now you can enjoy the same exploitation at home. The basic claim here is that the wrap system contains infrared radiation, which penetrates the skins and (you know the drill) - removes toxins, increases blood flow and oxygen delivery, and melts away fat and cellulite. Right.It promises you will lose weight and inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, all such wraps do make you lose weight and inches - by dehydration via sweating. That’s the core trick here. Of course, water loss is not fat loss and in fact is counterproductive. But it is highly profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrared claim is not new, either. They are deliberately vague on this topic. How does a fabric contain infrared? I mean, other than by the normal method by which everything with heat will radiate away energy, mostly in the infrared. So this is just a fancy (read “deceptive”) way of saying that their infrared wrap system is a heat wrap. Which makes you sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low level laser therapy is a more high-tech bit of pseudoscience. Also known as low-energy laser or cold laser, this has been a popular item among some physical therapists, chiropractors, pain specialists, and others. The concept here is that the laser is in a frequency that is not absorbed much by the skin, so that it penetrates to the deeper layers - and that’s where the magic happens. You know the drill - removes toxins, increases blood flow and oxygen delivery. But the LLLT also allegedly stimulates the nerves to release endorphins, which treats pain and addiction.They also claim, of course, that it “elevates the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit about stimulating nerves is barely plausible. The other claims of pure hockum. At least something physical is happening, so that means there could be some physiological effect going on. But like any medical intervention, in order to honestly make any clinical claims the specific treatment should be tested under proper conditions (double blind, etc) for each specific indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such research has been done. (&lt;a href="http://www.cigna.com/customer_care/healthcare_professional/coverage_positions/medical/mm_0115_coveragepositioncriteria_lowlevel_laser_therapy.pdf"&gt;Here is a good summary&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, it’s by an insurance company and ultimately is used to justify not paying for  LLLT. But never-the-less it contains a good summary of the research, with a blurb on each study. And btw, I have reviewed these types of summaries for insurance companies before. So sometimes they use independent academic review, and regardless of their motives such work tends to be thorough and legitimate.) We see a familiar pattern for treatments with little or no effect - many poor-quality studies with results all over the place, and a few better quality studies that are negative or ambiguous. Also the effect seems easiest to demonstrate for the most subjective symptoms - like pain. The more objective outcomes, like wound healing, are clearly negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cockrane and other reviews of the literature conclude that there is emerging definitive evidence that LLLT does not work for wound healing (which cuts to the heart of many of the claims made for it). For more subjective outcomes, like pain, the evidence is equivocal and “larger and better studies are required.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that, while mildly interesting, there is yet to be a single proven indication for LLLT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes it perfect for the spa. It is being researched by legitimate researchers, it’s all fancy and high tech, and there is a long list of common and often subjective ailments for which it is being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it is a medical device. That means it must be cleared for use as a medical device by the FDA. What almost always happens in such cases (and is true here also) is that dubious companies using such devices will proudly state that they have been “cleared” by the FDA, stated in such a way as to encourage the false impression that the specific application they are selling has been “approved” by the FDA, which is not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end the claims made here are cookie-cutter spa and supplement industry marketing nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236514945710"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1213">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f4e90b1e434fa3dd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><title type="html">A nation of Limbaugh enablers?</title><published>2009-03-08T12:21:48Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T12:21:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1213" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, Gail Collins asked ("&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/07/opinion/07collins.html"&gt;Just Steele Yourselves&lt;/a&gt;", NYT 3/6/2009):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;So is Steele the de facto leader of the Republican Party? Anybody who announces “I’m the de facto leader” probably isn’t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Then who is? Rush Limbaugh? He sure is enjoying the attention. “The administration is enabling me,” he told Politico. Honestly, “enabling” is not the perfect choice of words for a guy with Rush’s background. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Collins' source for the Rush Limbaugh quote is Jonathan Martin, "&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/19596.html"&gt;Rush Job: Inside Dems' Limbaugh Plan&lt;/a&gt;", 3/4/2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Limbaugh is embracing the line of attack, suggesting a certain symbiosis between him and his political adversaries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"The administration is enabling me,” he wrote in an e-mail to POLITICO. “They are expanding my profile, expanding my audience and expanding my influence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;enabling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an odd word  for El Rushbo to choose, given his well-publicized struggles with drug addiction. The new negative sense of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and its derivatives has so nearly overwhelmed the older positive or neutral meanings, at least in the construction he used,  that Ms. Collins doesn't even need to remind her readers about it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
William Safire wrote about this development last year ("&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE3DE153DF932A15755C0A96E958260&amp;amp;sec=&amp;amp;spon=&amp;amp;&amp;amp;scp=8&amp;amp;sq=enabler&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;Empowering Out, Enabling In&lt;/a&gt;", 6/21/2008):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Especially in its noun form, enabler, this word has made a quantum jump from hero to villain. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Some people still use the word in its positive sense […] But many are substituting facilitator for that positive sense of &amp;quot;helper&amp;quot; and are using enabler to mean &amp;quot;one who by ignoring, appeasing or condoning makes possible the continuance of wrongdoing.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This sense has its origin in the group therapy that is now called the recovery movement. Bill Pittman of Alcoholics Anonymous, co-author of the 1989 &amp;quot;AA, The Way It Began,&amp;quot; says that its use of &amp;quot;the word enabling first appeared in Al-Anon literature in the early 60&amp;#39;s.&amp;quot; […] A 1965 book reads: &amp;quot;There are many occasions when we all engage in enabling destructive or inappropriate behavior in other people.. . .Most instances are not so obvious or dramatic as the enabling that may have gone on with the alcoholic.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Wendy Kaminer, author of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Dysfunctional, You&amp;#39;re Dysfunctional,&amp;quot; defines enabler as &amp;#39;&amp;#39;someone who makes it easier for another to pursue an addiction, one complicit in bad behavior — like the wife of an alcoholic helping him hide the bottles from the kids.&amp;quot; She says: &amp;quot;The word enable can be contrasted with the word empower. You empower a person to do something good, and you enable someone to do something bad.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:40px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Though a lexicographer would disagree (a dictator can be empowered to invade a neighbor and a surgeon enabled to save a life), usagists understand that latest connotation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Usagists"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Safire sometimes makes it hard on &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/003889.html"&gt;those of us who defend him&lt;/a&gt;.  His idea here seems to be that lexicographers are not allowed to document the development of connotational meanings, either directly or (as is probably appropriate in this case) by defining new senses. And since lexicographers are insensitive to the facts of usage, there's a different job category, called "usagists", for the people like him who look after this aspect of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for the first time, I'm  wondering whether Mr. Safire might have been swapped with his counterpart from an alternative possible world. But there's more plausible (though not simpler) explanation for his periodic displays of deadpan twilight-zone discourse. When this sort of weirdness strikes, it's usually because he's trying to step diplomatically around a somewhat embarrassing point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case under discussion, he's reached a place in his column where the logical thing for him to do would be to tell us what the dictionaries say. But, I conjecture, he looked, and found that they don't get it. Neither the OED, nor the American Heritage Dictionary, nor Encarta, gives us the meaning for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enabler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) that he's talking about. Here's the AHD's entry for &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/13/E0121300.html"&gt;enable and enabler&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;TRANSITIVE VERB:&lt;strong&gt; Inflected forms: &lt;strong&gt;en·a·bled&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;en·a·bling&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;en·a·bles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1a.&lt;/strong&gt; To supply with the means, knowledge, or opportunity; make able: &lt;em&gt;a hole in the fence that enabled us to watch; techniques that enable surgeons to open and repair the heart.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;b.&lt;/strong&gt; To make feasible or possible: &lt;em&gt;funds that will enable construction of new schools.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; To give legal power, capacity, or sanction to: &lt;em&gt;a law enabling the new federal agency.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; To make operational; activate: &lt;em&gt;enabled the computer's modem; enable a nuclear warhead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;OTHER FORMS: &lt;strong&gt;en·a'bler&lt;/strong&gt; —NOUN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's &lt;a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/enable.html"&gt;Encarta&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;1. provide somebody with means: to provide somebody with the resources, authority, or opportunity to do something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;2. make something possible: to make something possible or feasible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;enabling legislation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;3. give somebody or something legal authority: to confer legal power or authority on somebody or something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;4. cause something to start to operate: to make a piece of equipment or computer system functional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;en·a·ble·ment&lt;/strong&gt; noun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e·na·bler&lt;/strong&gt; noun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's the entry for &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enable"&gt;enable&lt;/a&gt; in the Merriam-Webster online Collegiate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 a:&lt;/strong&gt; to provide with the means or opportunity &amp;lt;training that &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b:&lt;/strong&gt; to make possible, practical, or easy &amp;lt;a deal that would &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt; passage of a new law&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt; c: &lt;/strong&gt;to cause to operate &amp;lt;software that &lt;em&gt;enable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; the keyboard&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;2:&lt;/strong&gt; to give legal power, capacity, or sanction to &amp;lt;a law &lt;em&gt;enabling&lt;/em&gt; admission of a state&amp;gt;&amp;lt; people to earn a living&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of saying that the lexicographers have collectively dropped the ball on this one, however, Mr. Safire (I conjecture) spun out the previously-quoted nonsense about lexicographers vs. usagists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if he'd looked a bit futher, he might have found the M-W definition for &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enabler"&gt;enabler&lt;/a&gt; (assuming that it was in place last June):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;one that enables another to achieve an end ; especially : one who enables another to persist in self-destructive behavior (as substance abuse) by providing excuses or by making it possible to avoid the consequences of such behavior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it would have been fair for him to say that the rest of the lexicographers have, in fact, dropped the ball — or, perhaps, completed their entries before the new &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; became prominent — rather than to excuse them on the grounds that they&amp;#39;re not members of a non-existent category of &amp;quot;usagists&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw material for their revisions is not hard to find, but here's  a random pre-Limbaugh example from the New York Times a decade ago, which I used as the pattern for this post's headline ("&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1D71539F934A1575AC0A96E958260&amp;amp;scp=3&amp;amp;sq=enabling&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;'Enabling' is now a political disease&lt;/a&gt;", 9/27/1998):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"A NATION of Clinton Enablers?" a headline in The New York Post queried. "We have all been enablers for Bill Clinton," declared Time magazine. Last week, an editorial in this newspaper spoke of Mr. Clinton's "documentably dysfunctional personality" and warned that "we must not become a nation of enablers." In a recent speech, the television evangelist (and sometime Clinton counselor) Robert Schuller asserted that "we all share part of the shame" for stubbornly high public approval ratings that have enabled President Clinton so far to avoid confronting the problem of his sexual behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years before that, Gina Kolata asked ("&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E4DA153CF932A35751C1A960958260&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;sq=enabling&amp;amp;st=nyt"&gt;The Fat-Enabling Culture&lt;/a&gt;", 12/1/1996) "Has America become an fat-enabling society, akin to the  alcohol-enabling families that assist heavy drinking even while  condemning it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving back in time again, we find "&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E0DA1E31F935A25752C0A962958260&amp;amp;scp=1&amp;amp;sq=enabling+addiction&amp;amp;st=nyt"&gt;Curbing the Urge to Give; Where the Beggars Meet the Begged&lt;/a&gt;", 1/16/1994: &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"And the growing recovery movement and its 12-step programs made some residents feel that giving money to those who suffer from an addiction is only 'enabling' their illness."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveying fifteen years of examples, I also see a shift away from the emphasis on self-destructive behavior (like addiction) to destructive behavior in general.  Thus there are &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch?query=enabling+Mugabe&amp;amp;submit.x=0&amp;amp;submit.y=0&amp;amp;submit=sub"&gt;several pieces&lt;/a&gt; criticizing the role of Thabo Mkeki and other African leaders  in "enabling" Robert Mugabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, it seems pretty clear that &amp;quot;enabling&amp;quot; Rush Limbaugh, in this sense, is exactly what the national leaders of the Democratic party want — they hope he&amp;#39;ll do to the Republican party what Mugabe has done to Zimbabwe.  It&amp;#39;s interesting that Limbaugh recognizes their motivations, or at least their actions, and uses the word &amp;quot;enabling&amp;quot; to describe them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll close with a quantitative note justifying my claim about the relative frequency of the new sense of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enabling&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This word occurred 233 times in the NYT between 1/1/2008 and 1/1/2009.  Of these, 26 (11%) were clearly used in the negative sense of &amp;quot;make continued wrongdoing possible&amp;quot;.  However, the senses were split  according to the syntactic frame — the pattern &amp;quot;enabling &amp;lt;noun phrase&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;verb phrase&amp;gt;&amp;quot;  was 100%  the old positive meaning, while the pattern &amp;quot;enabling &amp;lt;noun phrase&amp;gt;&amp;quot; (i.e. a direct object without any following infinitive) favored the new sense, 22 to 17 (by my count).  When the direct object referred to a human being, the statistics favored the new sense even more strongly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236508025128"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_226.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cb91e4ac3ca18417</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Clock Quotes"/><title type="html">Clock Quotes</title><published>2009-03-08T08:55:38Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T08:55:38Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/yLO7gINZh9g/clock_quotes_226.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/clock_quotes_226.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The individual woman is required ... a thousand times a day to choose either to accept her appointed role and thereby rescue her good disposition out of the wreckage of her self- respect, or else follow an independent line of behavior and rescue her self-respect out of the wreckage of her good disposition. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Plans to locate a group home for eight children on the autism spectrum in Union on Long Island were met with outcry at a town board meeting, according to yesterday's &lt;a href="http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20090307/NEWS01/903070340/1001"&gt;PressConnects&lt;/a&gt; of Greater Binghamton. Concerns were raised about the children being subjected to "treatment research" and about the location being "dangerous because of a steep drop-off behind the site."  The proposed group home is one of three such planned under an initiative of the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities (OMRDD).  According to Nicole. A. Weinstein, acting public information director for OMRDD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;........... the Prescott Avenue site was big enough to accommodate the house and provide land for outside recreational use. It also is in a quiet, residential neighborhood, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is important to address possible sensitivities to noise, as well as safety concerns - not wanting to be on a high-traffic road," Weinstein wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is relatively close to restaurants, parks and stores, important for community integration, Weinstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial plan for the house was that it be a two-family duplex, with four individuals housed in each unit, but this plan would not have fallen "within the town's zoning for that area - single-family home."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few, but more and more families we know have been talking about buying houses now or soon for their kids on the spectrum and turning these into group homes. One family I spoke to said that they are joining other families to purchase a house and have their children (who are around Charlie's age and a bit younger) start using it and living in it, all with the intent of preparing their kids to be familiar in the house that could well be where they are for their lifespan. The &lt;a href="http://www.pressconnects.com/article/20090307/NEWS01/903070340/1001"&gt;PressConnects&lt;/a&gt; article reminds me that, more than just making sure you've a house (and funds for the house), you've got to check out local zoning regulations and deal with the town board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, one also wonders about the possibility about neighbors and residents having unexpressed reservations about a group home in their neighborhood. Ironically, I could see Charlie---if he's living (as we hope) in some kind of residence in the community being a quite good neighbor. Once he got into a routine of taking care of the house---mowing the lawn, taking out the garbage, cleaning, and more---I suspect he'd be inclined to do these regularly. Charlie's often most peaceful when things are in an established routine and his main activities would perhaps, fall into a predictable sequence of work, after-work activities, taking care of the house, hanging in the front yard. Neighbors would have the assurance of the same residents in the house for a long period of time. (A &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-key-of-g-new-pbs-documentary/"&gt;documentary called The Key of G&lt;/a&gt;----see also a &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/community_options_to_meet_support_needs"&gt;recent post by Dora&lt;/a&gt;---show such a community-based residential model; in &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/the-key-of-g-new-pbs-documentary/"&gt;The Key of G&lt;/a&gt;, a young man named Gannet, who has physical and developmental disabilities, lives with a regular support staff in a house in San Francisco.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if all that might work out; it's a hope. It's why we're more than totally behind &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/nj_de-institutionalization_bill_a3625_change_amp_hope_for_the_future"&gt; New Jersey De-Institutionalization Bill A3625&lt;/a&gt;. (And if you haven't, support &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/autisticadvocacy/actions/view/support_a3625_and_community_living_for_new_jerseyans_with_developmental_disabilities"&gt;this action alert on A3625&lt;/a&gt;). It's so important that Charlie and individuals on the autism spectrum live in and be part of the community. The longer they are shut away, the less people will know about autism and developmental and other disabilities; the less they'll know about the individuals who have such diagnoses, and the less inclined they well may be to live with and among individuals with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there anyone on the spectrum or with a disability who lives in your neighborhood? Do you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by &lt;a href="http://findadoc.upmc.com/PhysicianBioQuery.aspx?ID=25005052&amp;amp;A="&gt;Hilary Tindle&lt;/a&gt;, an internist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, analyzed eight years of data on 97,253 women, age 50 and over, participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=hormone-replacement-therapy-dramati-2008-12-15"&gt;Women’s Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a 15-year study launched in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Their findings, released this week at a conference of the American Psychosomatic Society in Chicago: the women who were most cheery were 30 percent less likely to die of heart disease and 14 percent less likely than their pessimistic peers to die from all causes during the study period. The results were even more striking among black women; the optimists among them were 38 percent less likely to die of heart disease and 33 percent less likely to die from all causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By this I mean that if the Christian believer has the will to believe, then this person also has the ability to explain away exactly why either God or prayer fails to work, or explain a positive random event as the will of God or an answer to prayer. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example of the Bible as a catalyst would be the story of the Prophet Elijah on Mount Carmel squaring off with the 450 heathen prophets of Baal (and 400 heathen prophets of Asherah: I‘m not sure what happen to them ( 1 Kings 18: 20 -40)).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can not count the times I heard this preached on at Bob Jones University and in many Baptist churches as an example of what faith in the true God can do. Hey, we all know lighting is a destructive force and how even Jesus (Luke 9: 54) just as Luke in Acts has Paul ( Acts 9: 3 -9 = Acts 22: 6 - 11 = Act\s 26:12 -18) seeing such forces of nature as miracles from God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, I have never heard the wild, but equally truthful Biblical story of Jacob tricking Laban out of his flock by peeling the bark off a stick and placing it near the animal‘s watering hole to cause the breeding animals to produce striped, speckled, and spotted offspring: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods. He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the gutters, even in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink. So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted." (Genesis 30: 37 - 39).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But whether one story is preached on a lot to show the power of God while the second story in avoided like the plague from the pulpit; as for as the Bible is concerned, they show the power of faith in men blessed by God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, if one believes the Bible as written form Genesis to Revelation, it does not matter whether if Elijah is facing down the 400 prophets of Baal on Mt. Carmel; Jacob peeling the bark off a stick to make the DNA in animals mutate and produce weirdly marked offspring or Jesus coming back from the dead on the third day, as for as the Bible goes, they all carry equal Biblical truths or Biblical facts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, since these Biblical stories of God working miracles in the past must be accepted on faith if one is to be a Christian (a point we hear all the time from comments posted here at DC), for the faithful and unquestioning Christian, this Biblical catalyst will set in motion human denial of the logical for the religious mind that believes God can and does act today though miracles just as he did in the Bible. Since the believing Christian can not “Throw the baby out with the bath water”, then the miracle of Jacob’s peeled sticks carries the same miracle truth as the resurrection of Jesus; though not the same theological importance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We usually hear stories from survivors who have experienced an acute situation in which God has saved their life. This is often heard on radio and television newscast following a plane crash in which religious people give tanks to their God for sparing their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the entire human life on the plane is spared (as was the case of US Airways Flight 1549 landing in the Hudson River in New York recently) then the catalytic Bible with its miracle stories of faith seems to vindicate itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, when an entire plane goes down, leaving no survivors at all or when over half the passengers are killed during a crash, we only hear the praises to God from the humans still alive and able to talk while the majority of passengers killed are strangely pushed aside and silently left out of the miracle of God’s protection in this equation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As noted above, an acute situation does not leave one time to relax and think logically, but rather the suddenness of the situation makes it a “Knee Jerk Reaction” based on a cry for help from the divine realm ( the old “there are no atheists in a foxhole” reaction).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, doing a chronic or long term situation, one has more time to weight in on the Biblical claims and this mostly leads the victim to conclude both God and the Biblical miracle stories just don’t work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example of this is my 14 year old daughter went into End Stage Renal Failure in 1999. I vividly remember the night she and her Renal Nurse came home from choosing a peritoneal dialyzer and how she cried stating that she had to pick out a machine she had to be hooked up to every night to remain alive for the rest of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also remember the good intentions of the many churches which formed &lt;em&gt;Prayer Chains&lt;/em&gt; for my daughter’s recovery. I recall the night a pastor stopped by to assure her that God loves her and will take care of her. But I was even more struck by her response to this pastor. She said: “I love my cats and dog and I take care of them because I love them. If God loves me, then why didn’t He take care of my kidneys?” The pastor just stood there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, in contrast to the acute plane crash situation, the chronically afflicted victim has had time to be exposed to God though faith and prayer and has rightly reasoned that they are basically among the dead passengers in a plane crash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To further prove my point concerning the chronically afflicted victim and their lack of faith in God and the Biblical catalytic miracle stories; every two years we attend the Transplant Games where people who have had kidney, heart-lung, pancreas, bowel, liver and other donor organs (from both living and dead people (given so that others facing chronic illness and death can live)) attend to celebrate life by competing in athletic competition of life and friendship. The ages of these people include anywhere form a one year old child to 80 plus senior citizens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a former seminary student and preacher, I wanted to see how these transplant patients (most must take 20 plus pills per day the rest of their life to keep from rejecting their life giving organ) felt about God and religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To experience this on a large scale, I attended both the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in which up to 3,000 transplant patients attended and where many gave talks about life and the wonders of modern medicine and their loving thankfulness to the donor families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nowhere, and I repeat, nowhere, and at no time was there ever a prayer offered at these opening and closing events! Nowhere and at no time did anyone in these two hour plus ceremonies ever mention, thank or praise God, Jesus or religion as making it possible for them to live (instead, and contrary to the Bible, they praised “sinful man” and his works).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Unlike the acute person who “Finds God” in a panic during a passing time of trouble, these former long term chronically ill transplant people have seen the failure of God, prayer and religion in their lives. Many of the children and youth see themselves born (or created) by the very God the Bible and churches exhort them to turn to. They know and have first hand experience of the futility of religion and Biblical miracles. (Sorry District Supt. Harvey Burnett!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While the Bible and its God labels humanity as sinful and in need of salvation that can only come from faith and God, these thousands upon thousands of transplanted people know as a fact, that without modern doctors and drugs, they would be just another head stone in some cemetery waiting for Jesus to come back in just another failed Biblically based miracle promise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/21219785-165869353777709450?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published online recently in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Ecology&lt;/em&gt;, the scientists used observations during the last 20 years of rare cases of adoption among hyenas in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania in combination with the latest molecular techniques to identify genetic mothers to demonstrate that hyena mothers pass on their social status by supporting their young during social interactions with other group members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I don’t see that working so well in human society. Can you imagine showing up to college parties with your mom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123638337001957991.html#articleTabs%3Darticle"&gt;Well Reagan’s plan might have been worse.&lt;/a&gt; According to an excerpt from James Mann’s new book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670020540?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwfriendlyat-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0670020540"&gt;The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan: A History of the End of the Cold War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, he ACTUALLY tried to convert Gorbachev to Christianity. Gorbachev, an atheist, was having none of that, especially when Reagan’s argument was among the dumbest religious arguments out there and sounded suspiciously like one you’d here from Ray Comfort:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… Reagan then ventured further, taking a step that quite a few Americans would have found objectionable. The president switched from seeking to persuade Gorbachev of the value of religious tolerance to promoting a belief in God&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the meeting ended, Reagan became even more direct and personal. &lt;strong&gt;He noted that his own son Ron did not believe in God either. “The President concluded that there was one thing he had long yearned to do for his atheist son. He wanted to serve his son the perfect gourmet dinner, to have him enjoy the meal, and then to ask him if he believed there was a cook.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the two American notetakers who were present for this extraordinary conversation, one took Reagan’s effort at face value. “Reagan thought he could convert Gorbachev, or make him see the light,” said Rudolf Perina, who was then the director of Soviet affairs on the National Security Council in a 2005 interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was quite a trip – I got to meet the Oklahomans for Excellence in Science Education, and breakfast with Richard Dawkins himself.  The evolution issue is still hot in Oklahoma, and my visit coincided with a general cultural fracas in the state over evolution, creationism/ID, and what attention these issues should receive in public schools and in universities.  I’ll attempt to give a brief snapshot of how things currently look in one of the reddest of the red states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since 1923, when Oklahoma became the first state to ban the teaching of evolution (even before Tennessee, where the Scopes Trial took place in 1925), evolution has been a hot topic in the state, and 2009 is no exception.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seems to happen every year in Oklahoma, in 2009 there was a battle in the State Legislature over a Discovery Institute-authored crypto-creationism bill.  This time the DI’s trick was to use the guise of “academic freedom” to sneak bogus creationist/ID talking points into the biology classrooms of 14-year olds.  As in previous years, the bill was defeated due to hard work by dedicated citizens, particularly OESE, and by good decisions by key legislators on both sides of the isle. But like every year it was a near thing. (This year, for the first time in recent memory or perhaps ever, Oklahoma had a Republican majority in both houses.  The current governor is a Democrat, however, and vetoed an anti-evolution bill last year.  Before the evolution issue gets characterized as an issue that is determined by whether Democrats or Republicans are in charge, though, I should give a little context for readers from the bluer states.  It is important to remember that Oklahoma Democrats are not exactly what you could call flaming liberals.  In a recent U.S. Senate election, the right-wing, pro-life, pro-gun, socially conservative candidate was the Democrat.  The post-WW2 re-alignment of the two parties, where Democrats came to be the party more favored by minorities, secularists, and liberals, and Republicans the opposite, took place very slowly in Southern states.  Remember, back in the olden days, the Dems had a strong pro-slavery/pro-segregationist element, the Republicans were the abolitionist party and got 100% of the black vote, etc.  Which party is “liberal” or “conservative” on many issues has switched over time.  This is why we still have conservative Southern Democrats and liberal New England Republicans, although both groups have become critically endangered species after being targetted by the opposing party.  The Republican takeover of the State Legislature probably means that the new alignment is finally dominant in Oklahoma also, but individual politicians can surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the usual legislative battle, the 2009 Darwin bicentennial events have added fuel to the fire in Oklahoma.  The University of Oklahoma has one of the most impressive lineups of speakers anywhere, and has taken advantage of the events to highlight some of the amazing collections held on campus – including a one-of-a-kind history of science collection which includes the first editions of most Darwin works, and actual books owned by Isaac Newton, complete with marginal notes written by him – and a Natural History museum full of dinosaurs and other fossils “native” to Oklahoma, which you cannot see anywhere else.  While visiting campus, I was given a tour of the museum, and was impressed to see that the Natural History displays integrate evolution and a modern understanding of phylogeny from start to finish.   Amongst many cool things, the museum contains a massive ceratopsian (&lt;em&gt;Triceratops&lt;/em&gt; relative), native to Oklahoma and only on display in this one museum in the whole world.  The skull of the critter is thought to be the biggest skull of any known land vertebrate ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of the great evolution stuff going on, there was bound to be a backlash.  Just about the only active campus IDEA club (or maybe it is a community IDEA club, it is somewhat unclear) in the country is at the University of Oklahoma.  (It is worth remembering that the UOk IDEA club was formerly known as the Creation Science club. Yep, ID really is different than creationism!)  As it happens, the student leader of the club is also an editor of the student newspaper, and has published a number of articles and debates about “intelligent design.”  The club has brought in several Discovery Institute speakers (reported on elsewhere in the blogosphere), and according to reports the speakers are sometimes innaccurately portrayed as having been invited by the University or various departments, rather than by a student group.  They even brought in Dembski to “debate” Michael Ruse, piggybacking on the fact that Ruse was already visiting campus for a different event sponsored by the history of science department.  According to reports, Ruse was true to form in the “debate”, basically saying Dembski was a great friend who was wrong about ID, but not giving the kind of hard-hitting, tightly documented analysis which is required for rebutting the superficially-science-y talking points of the ID guys.  Ruse is an amazing scholar and speaker in many areas, but many have observed that he basically phones it in at these ID events, and precisely because of this, the ID movement keeps giving paid invites to him (and virtually no one else) for their “debates”, so that they can appear serious by appearing on the same platform as him.  This is somewhat annoying, but I guess I can think of worse things for the ID movement to do with their money than put it in Ruse’s vacation account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midst of all of this, I was scheduled to speak on Wednesday to the Zoology Department, and, somewhat more prominently, Dawkins was scheduled for a huge campus event on Friday (although, according to one IDist’s complaint, I am apparently in the same echelon of nasty eviolutionists as Dawkins, an insult which really made my day).  My talk on how the history of creationism/ID is intimately tied to the court rulings against these views went quite well.  It was well-attended despite the fact that my brain inexplicably malfunctioned on Wednesday morning, causing me to drive to the wrong airport at 4 am, causing me to miss my flight and making the incredibly nice and forgiving hosts at UOk reschedule my talk for Thursday.  I wondered if any IDEA club folks would make the talk despite by unintelligently designed evasion manuever, and they did and asked a few useful questions. (Basically: 1. What would it take for ID to become science?  My answer: basically, a testable, constrained model of the designer and design events, and then successful tests. 2. Doesn’t ID go back thousands of years? Answer: well, the classical Argument From Design for the existence of God goes back thousands of years, but the use of the conjunction “intelligent design” as a term and a phrase basically dates to Of Pandas and People in 1989, as do other notable features of “ID” not found in the older Design Arguments, notably the explicit denial that the Designer was necessarily God, the denial that this was a supernatural/creationist viewpoint, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the talk I got to have dinner with the Klebbas, biochemists who work on the flagellum and related systems.  Phil Klebba famously took on Dembski on the flagellum when Dembski visited in 2006.  You haven’t lived until you’ve had a long discussion of biochemistry, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics over wine and sushi in Norman, Oklahoma.  By the end of it I was drawing phylogenies and protein names on napkins and depicting evolutionary trees with chopsticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, guess who was staying at the very same bed and breakfast that I was at?  Richard Dawkins himself, plus his film crew.  The previous night, state representative Thomsen had filed a resolution in the State Legislature condemning the appearance of Dawkins and condemning the Zoology Department for having sponsored the event and for the general sin of teaching evolution unapologetically (inexplicably, various other departments who collectively played a larger role than Zoology in bringing Dawkins, such as Geology and History of Science, were left out.)  Vic Hutchison, head of OESE, had called me that morning to tell me the news.  A few minutes later I left my bedroom to go to breakfast, and across from me was the Dawk himself.  We had corresponded on email, but I had never met him in person, so I introduced myself and then instantly the conversation turned to the legislature’s proposed resolution.  Dawkins, for his part, couldn’t be more pleased – he has a list of places where he has been condemned or banned, including especially Turkey.  What was more unfortunate was the undeserved linking of the Zoology Department to the whole issue – this was really just backlash from members of the legislature who were annoyed that members of Zoology had successfully argued against the “academic freedom” bill in months past.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast was occupied with discussion of the resolution and what to say about it.  Vic Hutchison joined us at breakfast and explained what OESE was and the roll it played in defending science education in Oklahoma.  Dawkins, out of the blue, decided to put in a plug for the group in his public lecture that night, and arranged for his Foundation for Reason and Science (which has the mission of science education and not atheist activism, we were told) to donate $5000 to the group.  I doubt Vic had been so pleased since the time he figured out how to catch the world’s largest frog in West Africa (answer: get a big net, figure out which way the frog will jump when startled – important since they can jump over your head – and then catch them in mid-air).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what was possibly the most complete change of pace in one day of my life ever, after breakfast Vic drove me to the airport to pick up a rental car so that I could drive up to northern Oklahoma to see my grandparents.  My grandfather is a moderate old-fashioned Baptist, but my dear grandmother is a very conservative Lutheran and sent me creation-science materials when I was little; I am pretty much sure this is how I found out about the topic and became interested in the evolution/creationism debate – an interesting case of unintended consequences if you think about it.  Anyway, the two have been married for 60 years and still go to different churches on Sunday, never having agreed to choose one or the other, so the family also provides an interesting example of the virtues of religious tolerance.  We got caught up for a few hours and as I was leaving, I actually heard my grandmother make the first conciliatory statements towards evolution that I had ever heard.  Evidently there was a new pastor at her church, and the pastor had given a sermon which, while not really endorsing evolution and the old earth, stating that it perhaps wasn’t the most important issue for God or man to have a theological dispute about.  The statement that, for God, we are all still living in the seventh day of creation (which is obviously not a literal day) seems to have made an impact on her.  I don’t really like to provoke inter-family debates about evolution, I get plenty of that in everyday life anyway, so I left it there.  Like everyone else, she will have to reach her own position on these issues.  But this anecdote is one small piece of additional evidence in favor of the idea that there is perhaps a trend occuring where conservative Protestant leadership (e.g. seminaries and pastors) are de-emphasizing and perhaps de-polarizing the evolution issue.  If this trend is real, which is difficult to judge, it could have huge implications for the future of the societal conflict over evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got back to Norman at 5 pm, there was already a huge crown in line to get seats for the 7 pm Dawkins lecture.  The venue held 4,000 and was almost full.  I was lucky enough to have a reserved seat up front with various Darwin bicentennial organizers.  Dawkins opened his lecture with slides of the Oklahoma legislature’s proposed resolution and some remarks about the self-contradictory nature of politicans both invoking academic freedom and condemning a speaker with unpopular views at the same time.  He put in a plug for OESE and its website, www.oklascience.org, and then went to the main body of his talk, which was devoted to the meaning of the word “purpose.”  Dawkins advanced the idea that we can distinguish two versions of purpose – first, “archaeo-purpose”, which is basically the function which some adaptation serves, and then “neo-purpose”, which is the purpose in the brain of some organism.  In some ways this is just the standard ethological distinction between ultimate and proximate causes of behavior (we eat because we feel hungry, but we have feelings of hunger because natural selection favored creatures that could tell when they were running low on food), but Dawkins applied the distinction to a variety of phenomena in human society, and repeatedly noted that neo-purposes can subvert archaeo-purposes for bad (e.g., Nazi use of familial language to encourage blind loyalty) or good (e.g., humans adopting geneticaly unrelated offspring, coopting parental care and love feelings which would normally be applied to genetic descendents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was reasonably good although pretty standard if you are familiar with Dawkins.  The thing which was really surprisng was the crowd reaction – Dawkins got an opening and closing standing ovations and several long applauses.  The amount of emotion, which I personally didn’t really feel – perhaps because I am way too into these issues already and have a pretty detailed idea about where I agree and disagree with Dawkins – was pretty impressive.  There wasn’t chanting or cheering or anything like that, but you could tell that Dawkins was more than just a scientist and writer to many in the audience – he was a symbol of something much bigger.  Although he didn’t emphasize anti-religion in this particular talk, my sense of it is that Dawkins represents that segment of the population which is just fed up with what they see as the pervasive influence of right-wing politics, conservative religion, and anti-intellectualism.  I think people who live in a college town in a very conservative state may feel this more viscerally than those of us on the coasts.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question and answer period was also mostly occupied with pretty familiar issues, most of the questions being about evolution, science, and Dawkins views on religion.  It was during the religion questions that Dawkins brought out his sharper barbs against religion – saying it was “evil” to label children as being one religion or another, comparing God to Zeus and Thor and fairies, saying theology was not really even a subject, etc.  At one point, one unstable person in he upper decks of the hall couldn’t take it any more and started shouting about how he wasn’t going to let Dawkins insult his God, and started advancing towards the podium, at which point security showed up and chased the man out.  Dawkins didn’t seem flustered, I expect he has gotten this kind of thing before, and probably the film crew got it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My opinion on Dawkins’ critiques of religion is that they are just not hugely convincing.  It is not at all clear to me that monotheistic religion is really on exactly the same low level of credibility as Zeus and Thor.  I agree that the Bible isn’t good evidence for the truth of one religion over another, any more than any other holy book; but the bare notion that Mind is behind the Universe doesn’t seem that much more implausible than the idea that everything just exists or that reality has always existed, or that there are multiple Universes or whatever.  These are all pretty much incomprehensible and incredible ideas, and probably however far human science advances, there will always be the question of why or how the starting stuff – quantum vacuum foam or whatever – exists.  What I think is really lacking in Dawkins’s view is humility on this point.  It’s fine if he thinks that “stuff just exists” is better than “God just exists”, but at best this is a parsimony argument, and parsimony is just a rule of thumb in science, not some absolute logical principle allowing deduction with certainty.   If that is accepted, I think that even those who disagree strongly with theism should allow that it is not simply a stupid and crazy thing to believe.  And, once you concede that, once you’ve got God as an option, the idea that God might find it interesting to interact with humans is not such a stretch.*  Please note that I am not arguing for these positions, I am just trying to explain to the Dawkinses of the world how it might be possible that people could disagree with them on the religion issue and yet still be sane.  Pretty much any conclusion about these ultimate cosmic philosophical issues is pretty darn crazy when considered in everyday terms, and I think a little allowance for that, instead of just insulting everyone who disagrees, would be beneficial in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the ultimate religious questions, where Dawkins himself sometimes seemed to show some awareness that the issues get squidgy when you get to ultimate origins (he even explicitly appealed to “intuition” at one key point, which is fine but not a basis for concluding that everyone religious is “deluded”), the one other question where Dawkins showed some weakness was when he was asked about the source of morality.  For some reason, Dawkins did not go with what I think is the right answer – morality is based in innate human universal physical and emotional needs, tied to the capacity for reflection on short-term versus long-term consequences of actions and especially the need to maintain social ties in our species (see Bishop Butler’s “Sermon on Human Nature” and Darwin’s Descent of Man, chapter 4) – but instead had a long, rambling, and not very convincing answer about cultural change and how morality clearly comes from somewhere because cultures seem to be converging on liberal democratic values if you compare the present to a few hundred years ago.  I think Dawkins has this position because he, like Huxley, is actually afraid of tying morality too close to genetics and natural selection, because Dawkins, like Huxley, is well aware of the danger of basing human society on the “rules” of natural selection.  The other reason might be that the most cogent explainer of the human-nature/morality connection is Mary Midgley, who has long been an arch-enemy of Dawkins on various philosophical issues, sometimes probably based on a misunderstanding of Dawkins, despite her also being nonreligious, liberal, and a huge Darwin fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Dawkins talk we decided to forego getting in the 3-hour book signing line and instead went to beer with ERV and various OESE people.  After an intense couple of days it was the perfect thing.  ERV actually doesn’t swear every other sentence in person, which is kind of disappointing because ERVspeak-for-real would be quite a sight.  But, like Dawkins, ERV is much snarkier in text than in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got to run.  I’d like to thank everyone in Oklahoma for a great trip and a great experience. I may or may not get a chance to update this with links and corrections where I misremembered something, so I welcome edits/additions in the comments.  Let me leave you with the website for OESE: they do good work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oklascience.org" rel="external "&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oklascience.org" rel="external "&gt;http://www.oklascience.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* From here we can see easily why taking the further step of creationism/ID seems plausible to so many people.  The reason these views are considered very unlikely is not some a priori metaphysical judgment, but long historical experience with coming up with better natural explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to alert your readers that, sadly, one of the best professions for critical thinkers seems to have been infiltrated.  Yes, I'm a librarian and usually damn proud of it.  But just the other day, as I was checking the conference program for the American Library Association's Annual Meeting in Chicago this summer, there was cause to be less proud.  For, there on the program, in the "Auditorium Speaker Series" was a notice that one of the featured speakers was to be... wait for it...  James Van Praagh!   Arrrgh!  Even worse, the write up for the event sounds as if it came right from the computer of a HarperCollins publicist (as no doubt it did).

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Conyers bill (a.k.a. Fair Copyright in Research Works Act, HR 801), is back. Despite all the debunking it got last time around, and despite the country having more important problems to deal with right now, this regressive bill, completely unchanged word-for-word, is apparently back again. It is the attempt by TA publishers, through lies and distortions, to overturn the NIH open access policy. Here are some reactions - perhaps Rep.Conyers and colleagues should get an earful from us....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, Lawrence Lessig and Michael Eisen directly challenged Rep.Conyers on Huffington Post, not once, but twice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-lessig-and-michael-eisen/is-john-conyers-shilling_b_171189.html" title=""&gt;Is John Conyers Shilling for Special Interests?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You may have heard of Big Oil, but have you heard of "Big Paper"? We know, it sounds absurd, but check this out.

&lt;p&gt;Right now, there's a proposal in Congress to forbid the government from requiring scientists who receive taxpayer funds for medical research to publish their findings openly on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ban on "open access publishing" (which is currently required) would result in a lot of government-funded research being published exclusively in for-profit journals -- inaccessible to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-lessig-and-michael-eisen/john-conyers-its-time-to_b_172536.html" title=""&gt;John Conyers, It's Time to Speak Up&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Conyers' bill opposing "open access" is the darling of the publishing industry because it would force the public to buy for-profit journals to get information that would otherwise be online for free. A new report by transparency group MAPLight.org shows that sponsors of this bill--led by Conyers--received twice as much money from the publishing industry as those on the relevant committee who are not sponsors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, lo and behold, Conyers responded - the first half is "I am a good guy so you should trust me" and the second half is "this is what Elsevier PR guys told me to write, so here it is". Of course, as Conyers is a hero to many on the Left, some of the HuffPo commenters had a knee-jerk response to support him instead of trying to understand that, in this case at least, he is dead wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-conyers/a-reply-to-larry-lessig_b_172642.html" title=""&gt;A Reply to Larry Lessig&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The policy Professor Lessig supports, they argue, would limit publishers' ability to charge for subscriptions since the same articles will soon be publicly available for free. If journals begin closing their doors or curtailing peer review, or foist peer review costs on academic authors (who are already pay from their limited budgets printing costs in some cases), the ultimate harm will be to open inquiry and scientific progress may be severe. And the journals most likely to be affected may be non-profit, scientific society based journals. Once again, a policy change slipped through the appropriations process in the dark of night may enhance open access to information, but it may have unintended consequences that are severe. This only emphasizes the need for proper consideration of these issues in open session.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, although that was posted on Friday night (why, just like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2007/08/this_prism_does_not_turn_white.php" title=""&gt;PRISM&lt;/a&gt; was posted on a Friday night), several people already responded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Brayton: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/03/is_conyers_shilling_for_scient.php" title=""&gt;Is Conyers Shilling for Scientific Publishers?&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the research is funded with taxpayer money, why should taxpayers have to pay for journal access in order to see the results? Good question. Lessig and Eisen point to this report by MAPLight, an organization that highlights the influence of money in Congress, that suggests that Conyers is doing the bidding of publishers in order to preserve their profits. The report shows that those members of the House Judiciary Committee who are co-sponsoring the bill, including Conyers, received twice as much in donations from the publishing industry than those on the committee who are not sponsoring the bill.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Suber: &lt;a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/03/rep-conyers-defends-his-bill.html" title=""&gt;Rep. Conyers defends his bill&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rep. Conyers insists that the House Judiciary Committee should have been consulted on the original proposal for an open-access policy at the NIH. However, William Patry, former copyright counsel to the House Judiciary Committee (and now chief copyright counsel at Google), believes that "the claim that the NIH policy raises copyright issues is absurd," and that the Judiciary Committee did not need to be in the loop.  I understand that the House Rules Committee came to a similar decision when formally asked.

&lt;p&gt;Clearly Rep. Conyers disagrees with these views. But they should suffice to show that bypassing the Judiciary Committee was not itself a corrupt maneuver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stevan Harnad: &lt;a href="http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/541-Rep.-John-Conyers-Explains-his-Bill-H.R.-801-in-the-Huffington-Post.html" title=""&gt;Rep. John Conyers Explains his Bill H.R. 801 in the Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Congressman John Conyers (D. Mich) is probably sincere when he says that his motivation for his Bill is not to reward contributions from the publishers' anti-OA lobby: He pretty much says up front that his motivation is jurisdictional.

&lt;p&gt;Here are the (familiar, and oft-rebutted) arguments Rep Conyers refloats, but I think he is raising them less out of conviction that they are right than as a counterweight against the jurisdictional outcome he contests because it is his committee that he feels ought to have decided the outcome of the NIH Public Access Bill. (By the way, the original Bill was anything but secret as it made its way through the House Appropriations Committee, then the House, then the Senate, as Peter Suber's many OA News postings archived along the way will attest.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Eisen: &lt;a href="http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=234" title=""&gt;John Conyers Tries [and Fails] to Explain His Position&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first several paragraphs of Conyers'  letter contain an outline of his record as a progressive politician.  Representative Conyers is a smart man who has worked hard defending the public's interest on a large number of issues. But no record, no matter how distinguished, can provide an excuse for introducing an atrocious piece of legislation that sacrifices the public interest to those of a select group of publishing companies who just happen - coincidentally I'm sure - to contribute to Representative Conyers and the other backers of the bill. 

&lt;p&gt;Despite his protestations, Conyers response to our letter - like the bill itself - is taken straight from the playbook of the publishers who oppose the NIH public access policy, and only cements my opinion that he is doing this at their behest without taking the time to research or understand the issue. Although he says at several times he is trying to get to the bottom of a complex issue, he ignored evidence presented to his committee during hearings last year and has shown no interest in learning about how scientific publishing actually works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope other bloggers pick up on this and send their readers to the phones of Conyers and others on the committee - they &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/02/who_has_power.php" title=""&gt;have to listen to their constituents&lt;/a&gt;, especially when said constituents prevent them from doing any other work by clogging their phones, faxes and e-mails for days on end....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/repconyers_just_doesnt_get_it.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~4/mAjtI4a3TI4" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds2.feedburner.com/ABlogAroundTheClock</id><title type="html">A Blog Around The Clock</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236492570805"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_open_laboratory_2008and_20.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4c82fcb118eb4c22</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="OpenLab08"/><title type="html">The Open Laboratory 2008....and 2009?</title><published>2009-03-08T02:30:42Z</published><updated>2009-03-08T02:30:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ABlogAroundTheClock/~3/-rL13P9ky3g/the_open_laboratory_2008and_20.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_open_laboratory_2008and_20.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Lulu.com &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/6110823" title=""&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; has already been viewed 1160 times, 30 blogs linked to it so far (see the bottom of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2009/03/the_open_laboratory_2008_is_he.php" title=""&gt;announcement post&lt;/a&gt; for the list), a very nice number of books (not tellin', sorry) has already been sold, and review copies are on their way to American Scientist, The New Scientist and Seed (I am also expecting a call from Nature as they reviewed the previous two anthologies as well).&lt;/p&gt;

Primakoff was the first Donner Professor of Physics at Penn, and served on the faculty from 1960 onwards. He was best known for his eponymous effect, which, among other things, describes the production of neutral pseudoscalar mesons by the interaction of a photon with a virtual photon in the Coulomb field of a heavy nucleus. (Intrigued to know more about Primakoff, I came across this touching &lt;a href="http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/hprimakoff.pdf"&gt;memoir by the late Peter Rosen&lt;/a&gt;, who had worked with him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since T.D. Lee’s inaugural lecture in 1985, a string of outstanding physicists have delivered the Primakoff lecture. But I was extremely lucky that, in my first year here, the honor fell to a cosmologist - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_James_Edwin_Peebles"&gt;Jim Peebles&lt;/a&gt;. Jim was nice enough to give an astrophysics seminar yesterday afternoon (on “The Cosmology of Small-Scale Structure”), and then, after an hour break, to give his Primakoff lecture, titled “Finding the Big Bang”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular-level lectures these days often focus on some of the more recent developments in the field, and the reasons they are so exciting. Certainly quite a few of my own public lectures take this approach. But Jim took a different tack, focusing instead on the sequence of events through which the big bang theory became accepted. He gave a wonderful historical account of the discovery of cosmic expansion, and a more personal description of the most important later discoveries; of the microwave background radiation (CMB) and the abundances of the light elements (Big Bang nucleosynthesis - BBN). Jim himself was around for a great deal of this important history (Indeed, it was Jim’s advisor, Bob Dicke, who set David Wilkinson looking for the CMB, only to be serendipitously scooped by Arno Penzias and Bob Wilson), and his take on how the various discoveries were made, and who played the important roles taught me quite a few details that I hadn’t realized. I don’t think I can do real justice to his account, but fortunately I don’t have to, since all will be described in an &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Finding-the-Big-Bang/P-James-E-Peebles/e/9780521519823"&gt;upcoming book&lt;/a&gt;, edited by Jim, with Bruce Partridge and Lyman Page, coming out at the end of next month. I’m sure we’ll write about it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening, I turned up for the dinner to celebrate the Primakoff lecture to find out that I was the second person to arrive, the first being &lt;a href="http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mowihsp/bios/cohn.htm"&gt;Mildred Cohn Primakoff&lt;/a&gt;. Being new to Penn, I didn’t know that Mildred was around, and it was a wonderful surprise to meet her. Ms. Primakoff was born in 1913, and became a successful female scientist at a time when that was far less common than today, becoming the Benjamin Rush Professor of Physiological Chemistry at Penn, and receiving the National Medal of Science. They must have made quite a remarkable couple!&lt;/p&gt;

On the way there, I learned that neither Skatje nor Collin had ever even tried to read the graphic novel, so I almost slammed on the brakes and turned around to make them sit down and read it before I&amp;#39;d take them — but my own fanboi nature prevented me from putting off the movie any longer, so I took them anyway. The kids have been sternly instructed now that we&amp;#39;re home that they&amp;#39;re required to read it. Good thing I kept going, too — it was &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt;. Where &lt;i&gt;Ironman&lt;/i&gt; was last summer's exhilarating carnival ride of a superhero movie, this one is the grim and intellectual anti-superhero movie of this year. Ten tentacles up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that the movie did &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/03/oh_no_they_ruined_watchmen.php"&gt;remove the giant space squid from the ending&lt;/a&gt;, but — and this is rather heretical for me to say — this ending was &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;, and made the story even stronger.

It is called Red Lynx and is written completely in client-side javascript using &lt;a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="external "&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ui.jquery.com/" rel="external "&gt;jQuery UI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://keith-wood.name/svg.html" rel="external "&gt;jQuery SVG plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal is to host several of these javascript toys and teaching tools on PT and allow our readers to experiment with them.  I’ll be back later to explain the model, but I want to give y’all the chance to play with it and try to deduce the model beforehand.  (Of course, you can look at the code, but that’s cheating.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simulation is inspired by a few &lt;a href="http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/simulations/simulations.html" rel="external "&gt;Java applets&lt;/a&gt; written by Kent Holsinger at the University of Connecticut.  &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/coding-help.html" rel=""&gt;Dan Earle&lt;/a&gt; came through big time by porting the binomial random number generator from GSL to javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internet Explorer does not have native support for SVG graphics.  You can install  &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html" rel="external "&gt;Adobe SVG viewer&lt;/a&gt; or the
&lt;a href="http://www.examotion.com/index.php?id=product_player" rel="external "&gt;Renesis Player&lt;/a&gt; to use the simulator.&lt;/p&gt;


 




&lt;div&gt;

    &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Start Red Lynx Simulator
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;  I’ve made some changes based on feed back that I’ve received and some new ideas I had.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The day before you're going to bake the pie:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out to the garden and pick about 150 violets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were around here a few months ago, the day after the Fall Back day, you probably read &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2008/11/spring_forward_fall_back_shoul.php" title=""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disregarding the debate over rhetoric of science, that is probably my best, most detailed explanation for what happens to our bodies on those too strange days of the year - Spring Forward and Fall Back day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Forward is much more dangerous, so be very careful in the mornings next week, especially on Monday. Take it easy, get up slowly, be a little late for work if you can afford it. Life and health are more important than a few minutes of work and being punctual on a day like that.&lt;/p&gt;

My son's in an in-district public school autism program. This year, the school district has had some extra challenges, when a number of new students moved into the district last August, just at the start of the school year, and with "budget cuts" having become a too-familiar phrase in the current economic climate. Today's &lt;a href="http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/news_details/article/16/2009/march/07/special-education-moves-pondered-to-cut-costs.html"&gt;Buck's County Courier Times&lt;/a&gt; reports that a school district in Bristol, Pennsylvania, is taking measures such as moving students from private, out-of-district placements, back to the district. Some 40 new special education students have enrolled in the Bristol schools since July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sorts of measures arouse a number of feelings and concerns in me. On the one hand I'm grateful that my school district has been able to create such a good program that people want their children to be in it---on the other hand, more students means more teachers and aides and therapists are needed. (There's already only one Occupational Therapist for all the students on the spectrum in our district----she must be beyond busy.)  I think it's important for my son to be educated in a school in our town rather than in a separate school, but this wouldn't be the case if the program and services were at their current level.  We know more than a few families whose children attend out-of-district schools here in NJ and IEP time must be extra nerve-wracking as parents know they'll have to contend with a school district thinking more about the bottom line than about the best education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to us to remind school administrators about this; that &lt;a href="http://autism.change.org/blog/view/special_ed_vs_gifted"&gt;special education&lt;/a&gt; students, like all students, need the best education possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Kristina Chew</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236466944770"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-7881630590714335197">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c75a1ab50e836332</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Science education journal links.</title><published>2009-03-07T21:02:00Z</published><updated>2009-03-12T13:18:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/7TLdSZyJEVY/science-education-journal-links.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=7881630590714335197" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2009/03/science-education-journal-links.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">We often hear the stereotype that good researchers are not good teachers and vice versa.  I think this is vastly overstated, and in actuality many people who seek to excel at research also are driven to be effective instructors.  Nevertheless, there is a habit of teaching the way we ourselves were taught, even if this is not the most efficient approach.  This is where being a researcher who puts considerable weight on data can make one a better educator.  As Bruce Alberts, former president of the NAS and now editor of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;, once &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=5287"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Research has taught us a great deal about effective teaching and learning in recent years, and scientists should be no more willing to fly blind in their teaching than they are in scientific research.&lt;/blockquote&gt;To that end, I thought it could be useful to compile a list of journals and other sources that discuss the teaching of science in general or biology in particular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journals:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bioone.org/loi/ambt"&gt;American Biology Teacher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112782101/home" rel="nofollow"&gt;Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title%7Econtent=t713415834%7Edb=all"&gt;Educational Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/120878/"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title%7Econtent=t713737283%7Edb=all"&gt;International Journal of Science Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iob.org/general.asp?section=publications&amp;amp;article=jbe.xml"&gt;Journal of Biological Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nsta.org/college/"&gt;Journal of College Science Teaching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/31817/home"&gt;Journal of Research in Science Teaching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/108230/"&gt;Research in Science Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title%7Econtent=t713444901%7Edb=all"&gt;Research in Science and Technological Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/32122/home"&gt;Science Education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/102992/"&gt;Science &amp;amp;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science Cafe, Raleigh: Gene-Environment Interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EPA statistician and geneticist David Reif discusses the interplay between our genes and the environment. What does our shared evolutionary history have to do with common, complex diseases?

In its canonical form, the trope asserts that the Chinese character for &amp;quot;crisis&amp;quot; is a combination of the characters for &amp;quot;danger&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;opportunity.&amp;quot; A simpler variation removes the &amp;quot;danger,&amp;quot; suggesting that the Chinese character (or word) for &amp;quot;crisis&amp;quot; is the same as that for &amp;quot;opportunity&amp;quot; (sometimes stated as a proverbial equivalence: &amp;quot;The Chinese say that crisis is opportunity&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;…in crisis lies opportunity&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With or without the &amp;quot;danger&amp;quot; element, the trope is a favored rhetorical gesture by politicians and other public figures looking to pivot from pessimism to optimism. The roster of prominent American trope-users includes John Foster Dulles, John F. Kennedy, Condoleezza Rice, and Al Gore (a repeat offender). Now President Obama joins the list, but thankfully he omits the largely bogus framing device about Chinese &lt;i&gt;hanzi &lt;/i&gt;(along with the &amp;quot;danger&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/WEEKLY-ADDRESS-President-Obama-Presses-the-Case-for-Bold-Action-to-Address-the-Economic-Crisis/"&gt;weekly address&lt;/a&gt;, Obama said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a moment of challenge for our country.  But we&amp;#39;ve experienced great trials before.  And with every test, each generation has found the capacity to not only endure, but to prosper — to discover great opportunity in the midst of great crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if an earlier version of the address used the full-fledged &amp;quot;Chinese character&amp;quot; line, but then the speech-writers did some legwork, perhaps finding Victor Mair&amp;#39;s thorough debunkage on &lt;a href="http://www.pinyin.info/chinese/crisis.html"&gt;Pinyin.info&lt;/a&gt;, or even some of the trope-tracking we've done here on Language Log. Here's a list of our posts on the topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/002110.html"&gt;Crisis ≠ Danger + Opportunity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (ML, 4/29/05)

&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/004343.html"&gt;Crisis = danger + opportunity: The plot thickens&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (BZ, 3/27/07)
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/005204.html"&gt;Trope-watch, Oslo edition&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; (BZ, 12/11/07)
		&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/%7emyl/languagelog/archives/004343.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; of 3/27/07 gives most of the historical background, taking the trope back to Christian missionaries in China in the 1930s. It also gives a few &amp;quot;danger&amp;quot;-less examples, my favorite of which is this one from &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://snpp.com/episodes/2F08.html"&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lisa&lt;/b&gt;:  Look on the bright side, Dad. Did you know that the Chinese use  the same word for "crisis" as they do for "opportunity"?&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homer&lt;/b&gt;: Yes! Cris-atunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		Now, according to the President, we are presented with a &lt;i&gt;cris-atunity&lt;/i&gt; of our own.&lt;/p&gt;

An excerpt of the findings from that later link,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of children living with autism are very concerned about their children fitting into society, with very few feeling their children will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Make his or her own life decisions (14% compared to 65% of parents with typically developing children)&lt;br&gt;
    * Have friends in the community (17% compared to 57% of typical parents)&lt;br&gt;
    * Have a spouse or life partner (9% compared to 51% of typical parents)&lt;br&gt;
    * Be valued by their community (18% compared to 50% of typical parents)&lt;br&gt;
    * Participate in recreational activities (20% compared to 50% of typical parents)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above percentages come from the perceptions and concerns of parents, not a survey of concrete outcomes for adults on the spectrum.  In other words it is not a "fact" that only 9% of all autistic people have a life partner, it is that only 9% of all parents surveyed feel that their child will have a life partner in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can be done to change this sort of perception of failure?  What are the main causes of this perception?  Does this perception of failure have any sort of negative impact on the children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the actual outcome for adults (both autistic and non-autistic/non-disabled) in these areas, rather than the percieved outcome by parents?  In other words, how warranted are the parent concerns? (Existing research on adult outcomes for individuals on the spectrum is extremely sparse.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the next step to take from surveys of this sort?  Easter Seals says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easter Seals will use the study results to raise awareness of and advocate for the life-long services millions of families living with autism desperately need -- including school to work transitions, employment support, residential and community support, and financial planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For parents of kids with autism, there are no simple answers," adds Wright. "There is an urgent need for increased funding and services -- especially for adults with autism. Easter Seals wants to help change all of this and make a difference for families living with autism today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there plans for autistic adults to also be surveyed to find out how they perceive their own needs, what their concerns for their own lives are?  Do adults have different priorities for themselves from the parents of younger children?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dora Raymaker</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism.change.org/blog/rss</id><title type="html">Change.org News / Autism</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://news.change.org/autism.rss" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1236456275037"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/07/kepler-and-the-carnival/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba15d7d68e3344db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Kepler and the Carnival</title><published>2009-03-07T20:00:28Z</published><updated>2009-03-07T20:00:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/03/07/kepler-and-the-carnival/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Congrats to everyone associated with &lt;a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/"&gt;the Kepler mission&lt;/a&gt;!

The Kepler spacecraft is now a solar satellite, slowly moving away from Earth, getting ready to start looking for planets around other stars.
