 &lt;li&gt;Ad hominem &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Appeal to authority &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Red herring &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/11/science_wrong.html"&gt;Science was wrong before&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/10/the_appeal_to_o.html"&gt;Appeal to other ways of knowing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Straw man &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Add claims of “concerted research and clinical practice” that his woo works, without one shred of evidence that his woo works, and you have Chopra’s entire article.  (He should employ me as his editor.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orac shredded Chopra’s piece in a slightly longer article (hard to believe, but true) than my summary, in a post entitled &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_woomeister_supreme_returns.php"&gt;The woo-meister supreme returns, and he&amp;#39;s brought his friends&lt;/a&gt;.  An excellent piece that pretty much covers it all.  Orac did leave me one small morsel to attack though.  It was this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; integrative medicine system would marry the superb options of high tech emergency care, its brilliant surgical achievements, the tried and least harmful pharmaceuticals, by empowering and educating its citizens to maintain wellness and prevent disease, through &lt;strong&gt;improved nutrition, exercise, stress-management, and a wide range of other proven integrative approaches&lt;/strong&gt;. Sadly, mainstream medicine largely ignores these viable health approaches.  [My bold.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“New”?  For many years, I remember being asked by my doctor, whenever I visited:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Did I smoke?  (No – but if I had said yes she would surely have told me to stop) &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What did I eat – and advised me to reduce butter and cheese and meat intake &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;How much did I exercise – and told me to exercise more &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;“Mainstream medicine largely ignores these viable health approaches”?  Bullshit.  As Orac and others have pointed out, this is just a bait and switch – Chopra is appropriating science based modalities (such as nutrition and exercise), and claiming they are part of the woo he is promoting.  Or as Mark Crislip writing today in &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=326"&gt;Science Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, so brilliantly put it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is innocence by association. By branding normal or proven activities as alternative, it lends an aura of reputability to the unsupported nonsense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Innocence by association” – I’ll have to remember that.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230927049529"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/02/pareitileia/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fea4a8a6e441898a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Pareidolia"/><title type="html">Pareitileia</title><published>2009-01-02T20:07:44Z</published><updated>2009-01-02T20:07:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/01/02/pareitileia/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;table align="right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jan/02/valley-resident-sees-portrait-christ-floor-tiles/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the worst pareidolia ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, I like to poke gentle fun at this sort of thing, since it’s clearly not a supernatural sign, but instead the way our brains see patterns in random noise (unless you really think &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/lenin.html"&gt;Lenin came to watch me bathe, or Abe Vigoda is in the Eagle Nebula&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you get something this ridiculous, and a virtual tongue-biting is nearly impossible. I just want to scream, &amp;quot;What are you thinking?&amp;quot; I see all kinds of faces and shapes in the tile in my bathroom: monsters, aliens, fish… even the letter &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;. Does that mean I should build a shrine to Elvis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sort of thing is symptomatic of a larger willingness to drop any critical thinking when it becomes something personal, and that is a human foible that causes an unimaginable amount of grief. People want to wash over this and just say that seeing the face or figure of their savior gives them comfort. I understand that and sympathize with it, but I also think it’s a sign, if you will, that as long as we’re willing to suspend disbelief for things like this, we’re willing to do it on much larger scales. &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net"&gt;And there’s a lot of harm in that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230926545145"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4964">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bec9b5d16d435890</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition, 1.2</title><published>2009-01-02T20:00:16Z</published><updated>2009-01-02T20:00:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4964" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=f1beafebbab2576c2ae4319408c7858f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 2009 everyone!

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the answer to that question may be “Quite a bit.” Apart from the cost in terms of money, time, effort and false hope, it now appears that one of the prominent “biomedical” treatments for autism may cause neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, 2008, the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurotoxicology&lt;/em&gt; released an “e-publication” of an article that casts further doubt on the efficacy and safety of chelating children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rush T, Hjelmhaug J, Lobner D. Effects of chelators on mercury, iron, and lead neurotoxicity in cortical culture. &lt;em&gt;Neurotoxicology&lt;/em&gt;. 2008 Nov 5. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the authors used primary cortical cell cultures to study the effectiveness of several chelators commonly used to treat “heavy metal poisoning”: calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (CaNa(2)EDTA), D-penicillamine (DPA), 2,3 dimercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). All but DPA have been widely used to “treat” autistic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treated the primary cortical cell cultures with four metal “toxicants”: inorganic mercury (HgCl2), methylmercury, ethylmercury (thimerosal!), lead (PbCl2) and iron (Fe-citrate) and then with one of the four chelators (and one control group that received the metals but no chelator). Their results may surprise some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPA performed the worst of all, providing no protection and actually &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; the toxicity of inorganic mercury, thimerosal and iron. EDTA reduced the toxicity of inorganic mercury but “caused a severe potentiation” of iron toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both DMPS and DMSA reduced inorganic mercury toxicity but &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; the toxicity of thimerosal and iron.  DMPS (but not DMSA) increased the toxicity of lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, these aren’t the results we have been led to expect. [Note: potential understatement of the year candidate]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this had been the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; study to suggest that chelation was potentially dangerous, I would be willing to shrug it off. After all, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; in cell culture, which is a questionable analogue for the intact organism. However, there have been two other studies looking at living organisms that have results consistent with the findings of Rush &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/114/1/19"&gt;Dietrich &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; (2004)&lt;/a&gt; showed that treating children with blood lead levels between 20 and 44 mcg/dl with DMSA [Note: chelation therapy with DMSA is recommended for blood lead levels of 45 mg/dl and above but not specifically recommended - or contraindicated - for blood lead levels from 10 - 44 mcg/dl] had no effect on a variety of neurocognitive tests at long-term follow-up (4 - 5 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they found a statistically significant &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; in attention and executive functions in the children treated with DMSA when compared to placebo. Given the nature of neurocognitive testing and the variation in genetic and environmental factors in humans, this result was not given a great deal of weight at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;amp;pubmedid=17384765"&gt;Stangle &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;showed that DMSA, when given to rats that were truly lead-toxic (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; blood levels in the toxic range &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; “provocation”) improved learning and etc., but that when they gave it to rats that &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; have toxic lead levels (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; the control group), there was a significant and sustained (&lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; permanent - it did not disappear during the duration of the study) &lt;em&gt;decrease&lt;/em&gt; in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does all this mean to parents who are - or are contemplating - chelating their autistic children? Well, it strongly suggests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] Chelation with EDTA, DPA, DMPS and DMSA does not “work” for organic mercury, such as ethyl mercury from thimerosal. The Rush &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; study was particularly pertinent to parents who think their children became “mercury poisoned” from thimerosal-containing vaccines, since it used thimerosal as the source of ethyl mercury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] Giving DMSA or other chelators to children who &lt;em&gt;do not have significant blood levels of heavy metals&lt;/em&gt; is likely to &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; brain damage. It is probable that the chelating agents cause some degree of neurological damage, but that higher lead (or other heavy metal) levels cause sufficiently &lt;em&gt;greater&lt;/em&gt; damage that the chelators are the “lesser of two evils”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parents (and not a few practitioners) have argued, “Chelation is safe; why not give it a try? It can’t hurt and it might just help.” Well, now we have a growing body of data suggesting that chelation might not only be &lt;em&gt;ineffective&lt;/em&gt;, it might &lt;em&gt;make your child worse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since many practitioners following the “DAN! Protocol” or similar regimens commonly give chelating agents when (unprovoked) blood/urine levels of mercury (or other metals) are well below the toxic range, these studies are directly applicable to this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional concern is that practitioners (and do-it-yourself parents) who chelate to “treat” autism often continue giving these drugs for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. Even the treatment of lead toxicity - which takes much longer since lead is incorporated into the bones - is usually limited to six months to a year, with careful monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who may be tempted to smugly ignore these warnings because they are using “natural” chelating agents or other agents not mentioned in these studies should rethink their complacency. The mechanism that causes the cognitive impairments seen after DMSA treatment - and the toxicity to cell cultures seen after DPA, EDTA, DMSA and DMPS treatment - is unknown. It may well be that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; heavy metal chelating agent can cause the same injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoilers (sorta) ahoy! If you want to know nothing at all about series/season 5 of Doctor Who, go away now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(looks around)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBC will be announcing &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; (Saturday) &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7807742.stm"&gt;the actor who will take over for David Tennant in Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation has been running wild for months, ever since Tennant announced he would leave. Some are a little out there (I personally would love to see the Doctor played by a woman, but I don’t think there’s much weight to those rumors). Another contender is &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7739408.stm"&gt;Paterson Joseph&lt;/a&gt;, who would be great. I saw him in the UK show &amp;quot;The Survivors&amp;quot;, and he’s very, very good. A black Doctor would be pretty interesting; I don’t think it would matter inside the universe of the show, but with Obama coming in, it might send out another strong signal that times have changed on this planet of ours (I’m not elevating DW to the status of importance of the POTUS, of course, but the show is watched and idolized by millions of people, and that &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make a difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do know that whoever it is, lots of people will love the choice, lots will hate it, and we’ll all watch anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll try to have the news here on the blog as soon as I find out &lt;del&gt;what’s what&lt;/del&gt; who’s Who.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s Comment o’ the Week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, but before I get to it, I want to mention a few things you might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a few weeks ago I was really happy to hear Iszi and Simon read an email from me on their excellent podcast &lt;a href="http://sundayssupplement.blogspot.com/"&gt;Sundays Supplement&lt;/a&gt;. (I think it was ep. 29? But whatever, you should listen to them all because they’re very funny.) Sorry I’m just getting around to mentioning it now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the other night Reed Braden conducted a short interview with me for his New Year’s episode of Two Smokin’ Hot Freethinkers podcast. That episode is &lt;a href="http://twosmokinhotfreethinkers.blogspot.com/2008/12/episode-33-happy-new-year-this-one-has.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (there’s a clean version elsewhere on their site) and also includes clips from Phil Plait and PZ Myers. I was very, very exhausted at the time of recording so my apologies if I am unintelligble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, on to the COTW! Christmas is long gone, but the spirit lives on in &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4943&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-44350"&gt;this hilarious rant by Phlebas&lt;/a&gt;, who really, really hates the song &lt;em&gt;The 12 Days of Christmas&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;phlebas&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/845ced3abab5af7e50dbe664846552e4?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Dec 26, 2008 at 3:49 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single line of “The 12 Days of Christmas” just gets worse and worse. After I was given an unsolicited partridge (regardless of the kind of tree), that twisted frakker wouldn’t get near me with the turtle doves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Was this written for someone who wanted to own an aviary and couldn’t get the stock? Out of that first week of Christmas, I have 28 birds and five rings. I’m not that much into the bling myself, but it would be a welcome change from all the bird shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first week, things perk up and “my true love” starts bringing me women. Seventeen girls in two days — I hope roasted calling bird has some potent protein. But this isn’t the 14th century — just because they are dragged to my front door doesn’t mean I can unilaterally command a fortnight of debauchery. If I tried anything, I’m quite sure those women (nine of whom are athletes, the others are working farm girls) could beat me to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the maids a-milking bring their own cows? If so, that will at least make me forget about the bird shit, but I can’t really call it “for the win.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I get 10 leaping lords? That sounds like something Robin would shout to Batman in a moment of surprise. Fuck that. If they have so much energy, they can shovel cow shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(When they say “lords” do they mean some sort of aristocracy, or 10 guys dressed as Jesus? Both are distressing, but the Jesuses add a touch of surrealism I’d quite enjoy, especially if they are leaping among the cow flops like they are auditioning for The Nutcracker.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the fife and drum corps show up the last two days. I’m afraid that would be that. You would all see me being pushed into a police car with a jacket ineffectively covering my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two unbearable weeks that will turn me vegetarian, asexual, violent, and totally against Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: I really hate that “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas” song too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations, Phlebas, you win the best version of the &lt;em&gt;12 Days of Christmas&lt;/em&gt; ever recorded: John Denver and the Muppets! I’m not even being ironic here, I absolutely love this and always – ALWAYS – laugh at Fozzie screwing things up. Maybe Fozzie’s adorable antics will make you love it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the first pareidolia of 2009, and we’re only a day or two in! It looks like it’ll be a bang-up year for people who think they see things that aren’t there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we have &lt;a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4807629a4560.html?Jesus"&gt;Jesus in a pita&lt;/a&gt;. Well, that’s &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be Jesus, but I’m assuming He’s been rendered in 8-bit graphics by an old Commodore 64. I don’t remember Him having a pierced cheek, either. Well, Goth works in mysterious ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/Antiques-collectables/Food-drink/Other/auction-195642530.htm"&gt;it’s up for auction&lt;/a&gt;. It’s cheap for the moment, but it may go up in price. But don’t worry: if you don’t have enough money to bid, you can always rob pita to Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230913335141"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3615">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/766a3df2c0307184</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="betting"/><category term="football"/><title type="html">What's With the Home Underdogs in the N.F.L.?</title><published>2009-01-02T16:03:02Z</published><updated>2009-01-02T16:03:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/Zr8bbqf0vew/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/whats-with-the-home-underdogs-in-the-nfl/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In recent years, the federal government has taken various actions to make it harder to bet on sports over the internet.

&lt;p&gt;My friend, author Eric Maisel, has written a new book for atheists. Going beyond the previous books that argue against the existence of God and debate the value of religion, Eric’s book is meant to provide a way for atheists to make meaning and find purpose in their lives. Perhaps saying his book is about atheist spirituality is a stretch, but I think that’s a good way to describe it. Instead of focusing on the negatives and framing atheism with what we don’t believe, Eric has focused on the positive aspects of living without gods, and frames atheism with things that we can believe in. Here’s a description of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Atheists-Way-Living-Well-Without/dp/1577316428/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1230910755&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Atheist’s Way: Living Well Without Gods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by Eric Maisel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Way&lt;/em&gt; answers the question, “How can a person make meaning in a universe that cares nothing about meaning?” It is at once an atheist lifestyle guide and a handbook on the practice of making and maintaining personal meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;In it, we hear from former believers who have made the journey from belief to atheism, survey thousands of years of atheist traditions, reestablish the primary role of personal responsibility in the realms of ethics and meaning, examine the rewards and challenges of atheism, and discover what is required of each of us if we are to live well without gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eric’s new &lt;a href="http://www.theatheistsway.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to promote the book has just gone live. Please take a moment to check it out and learn more. I’ll be writing a review of the book and interviewing Eric next month as part of his blog book tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep in the spirit of the New Year celebration, Eric has declared 2009 &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://theatheistsway.blogspot.com/2009/01/viktor-frankl-thought-as-our-year-of.html"&gt;The Year of Making Meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. I hope that many of you will join him in his endeavor to bring a positive outlook and uplifting discourse to the atheist life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>writerdd</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230911439681"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=968">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f38031cdecaadbe3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and culture"/><title type="html">Non-Whorfian linguistic determinism</title><published>2009-01-02T15:42:06Z</published><updated>2009-01-02T15:42:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=968" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been reading David Laitin's &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LR8A4tEYZUAC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politics, Language and Thought: The Somali Experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which discusses a kind of linguistic determinism that (in my opinion) hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.  So in keeping with my  third annual New Year's resolution to emphasize positive blogging about linguistic issues, I'm going to tell you about some fascinating 35-year-old experiments described in Laitin's book,  in the context of some more recent work on related issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll frame the discussion in terms of a deceptively simple question: do the results of public opinion polling depend on the language of the interview? The answer, it seems, is often "yes", and the effects are sometimes very large. This immediately raises a more difficult question: why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when Prof. Laitin's Somali assistants asked Somali-speaking students in the Northeastern Province of Kenya to complete the sentence "My favorite radio station is ___" (or its Somali translation), the answers varied as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Voice of Kenya&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Somali Radio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;BBC&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Asked in English&lt;br&gt;
(n=56)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;43%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Asked in Somali&lt;br&gt;
(n=70)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;51%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to complete the sentence "Between home and school, I prefer ___", their answers were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"Home"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;"School"&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Asked in English&lt;br&gt;
(n=68)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;68%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Asked in Somali&lt;br&gt;
(n=71)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are obviously pretty large differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar issue came up in passing on this blog last summer, with respect to linguistic priming of responses in tasks intended to measure "individualism" vs. "collectivism" ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=485"&gt;How to turn Americans into Asians (or vice versa)&lt;/a&gt;", 8/15/2008). In that post, I cited a review article by Daphna Oyserman and Spike Lee that gives "a meta-analysis of the individualism and collectivism priming literature" ("&lt;a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/daphna.oyserman/files/oyserman_lee_2008_psychbulletin.pdf"&gt;Does Culture Influence What and How We Think? Effects of Priming Individualism and Collectivism&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/em&gt; 134(2): 311-342, 2008). One of the priming methods that Oyserman and Lee discuss is the choice of language for conducting experiments among bilinguals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the abstract,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Effect sizes [of priming] were moderate for relationality and cognition, small for self-concept and values, robust across priming methods and dependent variables, and consistent in direction and size with cross-national effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Relationality" refers to "social obligation, perceived social support from others, social sensitivity, and prosocial orientation", as well as "more specific operationalizations such as the choice to sit closer to a target other".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cognition" refers to a wide variety of judgments, both social and non-social, that were among the dependent variables in the various studies that they surveyed.  Many if not most of the questions asked in opinion polls would fall into this category (though of course this meta-analysis considered only test instruments deemed relevant to the individualism-collectivism dimension).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they say that "effect sizes were moderate for relationality and cognition", they mean that priming changed these measures by about a half a standard deviation. (The actual range of effect sizes reported, for priming bilinguals by using one language or the other in administering the test, was -0.42 to 1.70.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they say that &amp;quot;effect sizes were … robust across priming methods and dependent variables&amp;quot;, they mean that choice of testing language had roughly as big a priming effect as other sort of interventions did (for example, telling stories intended to promote collective vs. individual values).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when they say that &amp;quot;effect sizes were … consistent in direction and size with cross-national effects&amp;quot;, they mean that priming (whether by choice of language, or story-telling, or other methods) had about as big an effect as the differences among nationalities did, overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, "priming" means that the researchers arrange for subjects to be influenced by some experimentally-manipulated factors that affect the thing being measured. Thus in a study measuring "individualism" vs. "collectivism", subjects might be primed by being seated at five-person tables vs. individual desks separated by partitions; or by being asked, before the test is administered, what they have in common with their family and friends, vs. what makes them different from their family and friends. Linguistic priming simply varies the language in which the questions designed to measure degree of invidualism vs. collectivism are asked and answered, or  the language that subjects hear, read, or speak before a (perhaps-non-verbal) test is administered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea, in Oyserman and Lee's words, is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Priming activates mental representations that then serve as interpretive frames in the processing of subsequent information. When a concept is primed, other concepts associated with it in memory are also activated. When a cognitive style or mindset is primed, this activates a way of thinking or a specific mental procedure. Mindset priming involves the nonconscious carryover of a previously stored mental procedure to a subsequent task.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that language-choice priming, in this sense, is a way that language influences thought. But it's a non-Whorfian influence, in the sense that this influence need not be causally dependent in any way on any aspects of the form or meaning of the language. Nor are we talking about Wittgenstein's idea that "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world". Instead, these are psychological effects that might entirely be due to a language's cultural, social, and emotional associations for the individuals whose thoughts are being influenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I should make it clear that none of the researchers  I'm discussing are especially concerned with the effects of language choice on opinion-poll results. I've framed their work in those terms just because this seems to me to pose some of the issues in a clear way for outsiders.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's go back to &lt;a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~dlaitin/"&gt;David Laitin&lt;/a&gt;'s 1972 experiments. He carried them out in schools in Waajeer,  a Somali-speaking area of the Northeastern Province of Kenya. The experiments included an interview and a role-playing exercise, carried out among 64 subjects from the secondary school, with half of them doing the interview in English and the role-playing exercise in Somali, and half the other way around. In addition, a larger set of subjects participated in two  easier-to-code exercises, where possible answers were more limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was a listening test in which students were asked to evaluate the voice of English or Somali speakers, and the other was a "composition" test that involved choosing answers to fill in the blanks in sentences, either in English or in Somali. The composition test is the one under discussion here, and it was modeled on one originally developed by Leonard Doob for studying "patriotism and nationalism in the South Tyrol".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laitin's English version of the test was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LaitinComposition.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/LaitinComposition.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the composition and listening tests, the subjects were the whole fifth year of the primary school (under 13 years old), and a set of volunteers from the first and second years of the secondary school (over 16 years old).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two tables of results presented above come from Laitin's "composition test", and the language effects are very striking. Thus when tested in English, students preferred &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;school&lt;/em&gt; 68% to 32%; when tested in Somali, they preferred &lt;em&gt;dugsi&lt;/em&gt; ("school") to &lt;em&gt;reer&lt;/em&gt; ("home") 75% to 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students were two different random samples from the same school, tested in the same setting by the same people within a short space of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to think of reasons for the difference, and Laitin suggests several. For example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… in outlawing tribalism in the Somali Republic, the Supreme Revolutionary Council has proscribed the use of the word &lt;em&gt;reer&lt;/em&gt;, which has rich clan overtones. Furthermore, the word I chose for school, &lt;em&gt;dugsi&lt;/em&gt;, was once primarily used to denote Qur'anic schools, so is not an exact translation of "school".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also suggests that in some cases, the students took the view that these were tests with right and wrong answers, and may have used out-of-classroom discussions to help their peers settle on the "right" answers. Some similar effects of group dynamics may even have taken place in the testing situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In both the composition and the listening exercises for the primary school students, although I tried vigorously to control it, the level of &amp;quot;shared&amp;quot; answers was probably high. With three students to a desk, and some forty-five students in a twelve-by-fifteen-foot classroom — a situation quite common in African primary education — most instructors recognize that the answers to their tests will reflect the collective consciousness of a particular desk. I may therefore have counted one independent observation (response form the desk) as three (response form three students). I could not collect a &amp;quot;desk&amp;quot; answer, because the relevant group was not always the desk, and because many students had answers that were different from those of other students at their desk or the neighboring desk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laitin also provides evidence that discussions of the tests were widespread even outside of the school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;After I completed all my testing, I spent a whole day quietly watching the local blacksmith making a knife out of a Land Rover spring and the horn of a cow. I had met him shortly after my arrival, and had told him I was working at the school. When a man walked in and asked the proprietor who I was, the proprietor answered that I was a student of languages, working in the local secondary school, giving tests to the students in both Somali and English, and planning to compare the answers to see if there were any differences. I was startled, not only because the metal workers were considered of low caste and therefore somewhat outside the society, but that anyone in the village would have such a clear idea of what I was doing. […] Insensitivity to the testing environment on the part of the experimenter, which this anecdote documents, is a serious problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But (at least in the context of this book) Laitin continues to believe in an effect that he thinks he saw as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Somali Republic in 1969:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I felt that there was a different social dynamic occurring among my students and colleagues when they were conversing in English and when they were conversing in Somali. I did not think that this difference was explained by their relative fluency in the languages, because I saw the same dynamic operating among Somalis who spoke English fluently, perhaps more fluently than Somali. And to a lesser extent (because my learning was much slower) I felt I myself was operating in a somewhat different world when I was speaking in Somali. Being a student of political theory, I began to relate the phenomenon I saw operating to ideas of cultural autonomy and political dependency. Could language be seen as a social institution which has its independent effects on other social institutions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for the literature on linguistic priming of the individualism/collectivism dimension, I haven't been able to find any systematic discussions of language-associated mindsets and their effects on (for example) public opinion polling. It's well known that small differences in the way a question is phrased, even within a single language, can have big effects on polling results. What about differences in the accent in which a question is asked? And are there any well-supported methods of normalization that would make it possible to compare opinion-poll results across languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Let me note in passing that Laitin's title &lt;em&gt;Politics, Language and Thought&lt;/em&gt; is an instance of the &lt;em&gt;X, Language, and Y&lt;/em&gt; pattern initiated (I think) by Franz Boas'  &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BnEV5JwQFhoC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Race, Language, and Culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I have a feeling that there are a number of other examples, but this may be only because I once co-taught a course called "Biology, Language, and Culture". ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230911148452"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/01/the_war_has_begun.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ea818aa39784f9e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">The war has begun...</title><published>2009-01-02T14:45:50Z</published><updated>2009-01-02T14:45:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/501025742/the_war_has_begun.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/01/the_war_has_begun.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...and I'm just itchin' for a fight.  The medical "De-lightenment", that movement to marginalize the role of science in medicine, has just made a strategic error.  Like other weak movements, they've formed unwise alliances.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_woomeister_supreme_returns.php"&gt;Orac reports&lt;/a&gt; that so-called mainstream altmed folks like Andrew Weil and Deepak Chopra have now made friends with the more obviously wacko altmed gurus, such as Gary Null.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps "friends" is pushing it, but these supposedly educated physicians are actually citing HIV-denialist Null as a reliable source for health information.  I'm tempted to coin a new internet Law here, perhaps &lt;strong&gt;The Chopra Blunder&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;"In an argument regarding medical science, when a person cites Gary Null as a source, the argument is over, they have lost, and anything they say in the future may be safely ignored.  And they may be laughed out of the room without guilt."&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an educated physician, I have the ability to comb the medical literature with tools such as Ovid or PubMed.  Hell, even Google Scholar isn't half bad.  If I have to resort to quoting a charismatic TV health guru with a fake PhD who thinks that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, perhaps my argument wasn't that great to start with.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, now that it's 2009, I had hoped that one of the most irritating people alive would continue his blissful quiet. I'm referring, of course, to Deepak Chopra, that Indian physician who demonstrates that a medical training is no protection whatsoever against pseudoscientific and anti-scientific thinking. Indeed, Chopra goes far beyond that in that, not only has he become a leader of the so-called "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) movement, also sometimes called the "integrative medicine" (IM) movement that seeks to "integrate" treatments that range from the dubious to outright quackery with effective scientific medicine, but he has &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;amp;client=pub-5976931228913298&amp;amp;cof=FORID%3A1%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%3BCX%3AScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fchannel%2Fimg%2Flogo_science-blogs.gif%3BLH%3A66%3BLP%3A1%3BVLC%3A%23551a8b%3BGFNT%3A%23666666%3BDIV%3A%23cccccc%3B&amp;amp;adkw=AELymgUqybH-ybYwr-YECR8I0gVY4IsqOWMAKfoy0oX4FKsgXVR0wTXDubPgNUWWxgCdlGIjamL1TNym7UAlkeU3V1vSIvnCwQ6_viDGHqOuUO4DWKJ4H48EsA3XqvPZ2UodE5dnWfGy7nRPauEvy9C97hgD13jVD6rvMwQ4YDxhRFk9iquRqf3U0rrdGSg3P4rGfqRWqfpP0EuyS8csxIzDqTMoOtl0HA&amp;amp;q=deepak+chopra+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0"&gt;subjected numerous other field besides medicine&lt;/a&gt; to his "quantum" lunacy, including evolution. Indeed, so bad is Chopra's "science-y" quantumness, that I even coined a term for it: &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/11/the_return_of_the_living_choprawoo.php"&gt;Choprawoo&lt;/a&gt;. I even came up with the only response ever needed to Choprawoo. He had been quite quiet of late, and that was a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that I'm still (sort of) on vacation until Monday, I didn't want to have to do too much heavy lifting, you know, like actually reading some peer-reviewed articles and doing an in depth analysis and critique. Fear not! I will be trying to do that more frequently in 2009. But in the meantime I couldn't think of a more amusing and at the same time more frustrating way to start the new year than to take a look at Chopra's latest, which he couldn't resist posting to that repository of anti-science and antivaccination stylings &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/leave-the-sinking-ship-an_b_154538.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; and also to his &lt;a href="http://www.intentblog.com/archives/2008/12/leave_the_sinki.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;own personal blog&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, Chopra is very unhappy about an article by &lt;a href="http://shambook.blogspot.com/"&gt;Steve Salerno&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published right after Christmas entitled &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123024234651134037.html"&gt;The Touch That Doesn't Heal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WSJ article was that rarest of things for the mainstream media. It was a direct, skeptical, and science-based attack on CAM/IM. Indeed, it even expressed fear that any comprehensive health care reform undertaken by the incoming Obama administration could provide the opening for CAM advocates and their boosters in Congress like Dan Burton and Tom Harkin to insert language into any reform legislation that would force the government to pay for quackery. It is a fear I share, and I was happy to see a major newspaper like the WSJ publish such an editorial. I was even more happy to see the article's conclusion:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_woomeister_supreme_returns.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/the_woomeister_supreme_returns.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/500919406" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230900080587"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/friday_cephalopod_dancing.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2cd8aa4d03cc9e18</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Dancing!</title><published>2009-01-02T11:38:35Z</published><updated>2009-01-02T11:38:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/500917667/friday_cephalopod_dancing.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2009/01/friday_cephalopod_dancing.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id%3D1445376%26server%3Dvimeo.com%26show_title%3D1%26show_byline%3D1%26show_portrait%3D0%26color%3D%26fullscreen%3D1&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=225" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/1445376"&gt;Octo-Dancing&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/rezado"&gt;Reza Dolatabadi&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

With the introduction of the first modern antidepressant, fluoxetine (Prozac) in the U.S. in the late 1980's, the pharmacologic treatment of depression has undergone a revolution (and an enduring controversy).  Older classes of antidepressants were often effective, but came with a host of unpleasant toxicities---MAOIs can lead to potentially fatal interactions with certain other drugs, and even foods, and tricyclic antidepressants, when misused, can lead to fatal overdoses.  Prozac, the first of a new class of medications known as SSRIs (later followed by similar classes such as SNRI's, etc.) appeared quite safe and effective.  Side effects were minimal, and overdoses were rarely fatal.  But as newer SSRIs were introduced, it became apparent that while treatment with these drugs was quite safe, stopping these drugs was not always pleasant.&lt;br&gt;

Westlake&lt;/a&gt; was one of my favorite ‘light’ fiction authors so I’m going to indulge myself for a moment.  He wrote under a number of pseudonyms, but a series under his real name, the Dortmunder books, are my favorites.  John Archibald Dortmunder was an orphan raised by the Bleeding Heart Sisters of Eternal Misery (or perhaps the Sisters of Our Lady of Perpetual Misery - I’ve forgotten) in Dead Indian, Illinois.  He grew up to be a criminal mastermind in New York City whose plans, with one shining exception, never turned out quite the way they were supposed to.  Dortmunder’s gang fumbled their way through New York for decades.  Among other feats, Dortmunder, along with Andy Kelp (car thief and general handyman), Tiny Bulcher (strong arm man), Stan Murch (driver) and an assortment of lockmen, stole the same &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;ruby&lt;/span&gt; emerald 5 times, stole a whole bank and then lost it in Long Island Sound, and (their one shining success) knocked over a major Las Vegas casino.  His faithful companion May, a cashier at a supermarket, supported Dortmunder in the lean times between jobs.  I’ll miss them and their meetings in the back room of the O.J.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/books/02westlake.html?hp" rel="external "&gt;Westlake died in Mexico&lt;/a&gt; (sub probably required) on New Year’s Eve.

You know, in case you're short a half chromosome like myself)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, here we are at the end of another year.  The last twelve months have brought about the deaths of Paul Newman, Harvey Korman, and George Carlin, goddammit.  I was watching an interview of Carlin on YouTube from last year and some little doucheface wrote in the comments:&lt;blockquote&gt;He makes jokes about God, then dies prematurely (71 is premature regardless of what people say). Does this send some﻿ smoke signals that GOD IS NOT PLAYING AROUND?!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ok, yes, I realize that picking on the helmetards who comment on YouTube videos is &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; attacking the low-hanging fruit, but come on.  Anyone who does coke and heroin for a good 20 year span (of heavy use, I'm talkin') would not complain in any capacity if they made it to seventy-one.  I weep for the state of the common man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in Indigo today (a book store, for those not in Canada) and trying to find a book or books to spend $75 of gift card moola on.  Of course, because I'm a huge geek, I head to the science section.  Correction: I head to the shelf and a half where the "nature/science/pets" section is located.  Allow me a small indulgence to tell you that the "religion/spirituality" shelves numbered five solid.  I mentioned this fact to my wife and she said that the store orders based on customer desire and purchase patterns.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck 'em.  What do you think would happen if the shit went away and all that was offered was material that actually helped people and taught them interesting and informative stuff?  People would read it.  I guarantee.  When a smart TV show (oxymoron?) raises its head - think &lt;i&gt;Numb3rs&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/i&gt; - the audience shows up and supports it.  People are getting tired of teh stupid and are needing a lil' bit of mental floss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and I don't mean that ALL the shit has to go away.  I'm not against some blather or pointless stupid crap like the "reality TV" garbage that's clogging up our airwaves and bookshelves.  We need that stuff but the problem is that the crappy shit is just washing over us in a tsunami of uselessness and time-wasting yeeacch.  I mean, &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; is good, but if one more of my "friends" asks me to join their fucking "zombie army" or their "mob rules" team, I'm going to start a group called, &lt;i&gt;"Fuck Your Mob Zombies in the Face"&lt;/i&gt; and invite them all to join.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah goddamn Palin.  If I have to listen to her garble and meander through a simple answer one more time, I'm going to name the next rat my snake eats "Trigg".  How the fuck do we live in a world where we have scientists landing shit on Mars, we're maybe two decades away from literally &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news148193433.html"&gt;reading thoughts with computers&lt;/a&gt;, and doctors are turning the movie &lt;i&gt;Face/Off&lt;/i&gt; into a goddamn &lt;a href="http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/08/21/face-transplant.html"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt;, but this fucking wingnut from Alaska who is the &lt;a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/sarahpalin/a/palinisms_2.htm"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"nation's foremost expert on energy"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. oil) according to John McCain, gets up in front of a townhall meeting in September and says this:&lt;blockquote&gt;Oil and coal? Of course, it's a fungible commodity and they don't flag, you know, the molecules, where it's going and where it's not. But in the sense of the Congress today, they know that there are very, very hungry domestic markets that need that oil first. So, I believe that what Congress is going to do, also, is not to allow the export bans to such a degree that it's Americans that get stuck to holding the bag without the energy source that is produced here, pumped here. It's got to flow into our domestic markets first.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jesus christ, what does that even mean?  And so many people loved her that I was fucking terrified.  Thankfully, she and her grandfather lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, speaking of politics for a second, Barak Obama is having Rick Warren give the invocation at his inauguration.  Hmm.  Isn't Warren the same dude who said this during the whole "Prop. 8" thing in California?&lt;blockquote&gt;“I’m opposed to having a brother and sister together and calling that marriage. I’m opposed to having an older guy marrying a child and calling that marriage. I’m opposed to one guy having multiple wives and calling that marriage.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The interviewer then asks, “Do you think those are equivalent to gays getting married?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Oh, I do,” Warren responds. (from &lt;a href="http://totalbuzz.freedomblogging.com/2008/12/23/pastor-rick-warren-tries-to-clarify-position-on-gay-marriage/10828/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;No matter how you dress it up, ass-kissing is ass-kissing, and the Christian Right in the United States has had political tongues sliding all around up there for a long long looooong time now.  So much so that I'm actually amazed that so many of them are against anal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here we are.  Stephen Harper is still being a dick up here in Canada, the U.S. looks like the "Change" it thought it was getting wasn't all what it was cracked up to be, and I have a bit of a headache.  If you so choose to be involved with something a little more inspiring,then check out &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFOC72DRPWY&amp;amp;feature=channel"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; of a long interview with George Carlin.  This is part one of seven and they're all good.  Enjoy and happy new year, bastards.  I love you all (except if you do "energy work", "talk" to the dead, or think Sarah Palin would make a good leader).&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

The highlight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[I]t does give me an excuse to post my (now annual) list of things we didn’t see from the main players of the ID movement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * A peer-reviewed paper by Dembski, Wells, Nelson, Meyer …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Or for that matter, a single peer-reviewed article offering either a) evidence for design, b) a method to unambiguously detect design, or c) a theory of how the Designer did the designing, by any fellow of the DI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * An exposition of Nelson’s theory of “ontogenetic depth” (promised in March 2004)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * An article by Nelson &amp;amp; Dembski on problems with common descent (promised in April 2005).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Nelson’s monograph on common descent (currently MIA since the late 90’s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to how the Designer did the designing, I’d like to see something about the manufacturing process too.  How did the Designer manufacture the stuff that’s purportedly designed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope your New Year has started out better than mine…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, my first breakfast of the year (umm…brunch…lunch…okay, I admit I ate at 3pm) was supposed to be an order of “Pecan waffles with banana”. But I was presented with &lt;em&gt;bacon&lt;/em&gt; waffles with banana…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(phonologically, the waitress should only hear the inverse with my accent, but maybe she craved bacon herself?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Mother Superior" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/mother-superior.jpg?w=77&amp;amp;h=96" alt="Mother Superior" width="77" height="96"&gt;Secondly, I went to &lt;strong&gt;Borders&lt;/strong&gt; to buy a 2009 calendar. I wanted something picturesque and local, &lt;img title="Naughty Nun" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/naughty-nun.jpg?w=68&amp;amp;h=96" alt="Naughty Nun" width="68" height="96"&gt;perhaps some purdy redwood shots or craggy California coastline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointingly, all that was left was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nuns-Having-Calendar-2009-Calendars/dp/0761150064"&gt;Nuns Having Fun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But we’re not talking taboo naughty nuns and their crucifixes, we’re talking &lt;strong&gt;Mother Superior&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These virginal sisters are nuns of fun and frivolity. Nuns around the campfire,  nuns on skates, nuns playing soccer, a nun on a tractor; and all in their most strict liturgical vestments…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="http://www.bfnw25079.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/naughty-nun.jpg" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/naughty-mother-superior.jpg?w=128&amp;amp;h=96" alt="http://www.bfnw25079.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/images/naughty-nun.jpg" width="128" height="96"&gt;It’s “Habit-Forming”, they pun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Hell it is…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while on the topic of bad habits…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spiritnow.com/horoscopes/weekly/"&gt;Sylvia Browne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; emailed me a “2009 New Year’s Resolution”.  Just for me! (and every other &lt;strong&gt;Leo.&lt;/strong&gt;) Sylvia suggested that I, “Celebrate other people’s uniqueness”. Thanks Sylvia. I can think of a few New Year’s Resolutions for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; too…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most &lt;strong&gt;New Year’s Resolutions&lt;/strong&gt; are about addictions. You probably resolve to lose weight, to quit gambling and go cold turkey on that heroin habit.  And I think it’s great that you want to improve your own natural selection in a sense; to go back to University, or stop being an utter shithead. But why is this a “New Year’s Resolution”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did you select &lt;strong&gt;New Year’s Day&lt;/strong&gt; to quit smoking? Why do you start your diet on &lt;strong&gt;Monday morning&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s part procrastination…we’re lazy, we’re unmotivated, and pass me that goddamned pecan waffle, I’ll start the diet after this one… last…indulgence…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think it’s part magical thinking…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to import a mysticism onto the chosen day. New Year’s Day, Monday, Tomorrow is a clean slate, a fresh start, an untainted new day, a new horizon, a new beginning.   There’s ritual, routine and tradition to it; but not rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why always tomorrow? Why not &lt;em&gt;right fucking now, &lt;/em&gt;irrespective of the date? Because you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do it, or you &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;to do it? Grandmotherly wisdom has already packaged this into nice little  idioms like, “Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.” If we don’t make change, change happens anyway…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s an old chestnut that our New Year’s Resolutions won’t be resolved. Potheads will continue smoking, the chubby will not only not lose weight but put on additional pounds, and the pisspots will continue to be found at the local dive bar.  But it needn’t be that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Trust me, I&amp;#39;m a Doctor" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/trust-me-im-a-doctor.jpg?w=93&amp;amp;h=96" alt="Trust me, I&amp;#39;m a Doctor" width="93" height="96"&gt;You don’t need to wait until tomorrow, you don’t need to attend classes or courses, you don’t need to buy a book, you don’t need to fire walk. Isn’t it exciting that you can do something right now, you fat, ugly, stupid, cigarette-reeking, alcoholic, pothead, gambling shithead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m saving you the fate of 1000 self-help books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust me, I’m a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

Then &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/opinion/27blow.html?_r=2&amp;amp;partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink"&gt;check this out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most Americans think we will! &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Charles M. Blow of the &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In June, the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life published a controversial survey in which 70 percent of Americans said that they believed religions other than theirs could lead to eternal life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This threw evangelicals into a tizzy. After all, the Bible makes it clear that heaven is a velvet-roped V.I.P. area reserved for Christians. Jesus said so: “I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” But the survey suggested that Americans just weren’t buying that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The evangelicals complained that people must not have understood the question. The respondents couldn’t actually believe what they were saying, could they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So in August, Pew asked the question again. (They released the results last week.) Sixty-five percent of respondents said — again — that other religions could lead to eternal life. But this time, to clear up any confusion, Pew asked them to specify which religions. The respondents essentially said all of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And they didn’t stop there. Nearly half also thought that atheists could go to heaven — dragged there kicking and screaming, no doubt — and most thought that people with no religious faith also could go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What on earth does this mean? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One very plausible explanation is that Americans just want good things to come to good people, regardless of their faith. As Alan Segal, a professor of religion at Barnard College told me: “We are a multicultural society, and people expect this American life to continue the same way in heaven.” He explained that in our society, we meet so many good people of different faiths that it’s hard for us to imagine God letting them go to hell. In fact, in the most recent survey, Pew asked people what they thought determined whether a person would achieve eternal life. Nearly as many Christians said you could achieve eternal life by just being a good person as said that you had to believe in Jesus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, many Christians apparently view their didactic text as flexible. According to Pew’s August survey, only 39 percent of Christians believe that the Bible is the literal word of God, and 18 percent think that it’s just a book written by men and not the word of God at all. In fact, on the question in the Pew survey about what it would take to achieve eternal life, only 1 percent of Christians said living life in accordance with the Bible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, there remains the possibility that some of those polled may not have understood the implications of their answers. As John Green, a senior fellow at the Pew Forum, said, “The capacity of ignorance to influence survey outcomes should never be underestimated.” But I don’t think that they are ignorant about this most basic tenet of their faith. I think that they are choosing to ignore it ... for goodness sake. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Picture this if you will: me, sitting in heaven next to some of the most obnoxious Christians on the web. Yeah, that'd be hell for me. Good thing the majority can be wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, about the majority opinion concerning the Christian faith itself... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

But still, it saddens me that the Doctor Who special ranks lower than what has become the biggest symbol of the commercialisation of the holiday.&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/164668-150x150.jpg" alt="164668" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Wallace and Gromit, for those who don’t know, are the principle characters in a series of animated shorts and one movie. Wallace is a cheese-loving Yorkshireman, and Gromit is his dog, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Labrador&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;. I have been with them since I was a kid, thirteen years old and staying up to watch as much of the animation season on late-night TV as I could manage. It was 1989, and one of the shorts shown was A Grand Day Out, the first outing of Wallace and Gromit and one of the greatest animations ever made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;A Grand Day out is the story of an old man, for whom no back story is provided, and his dog, who build a rocket in their basement in order to travel to the moon. Why? Because they love cheese, and everyone knows the moon is made of cheese. When they get there, they encounter a sort of park-keeper robot which wants to learn to ski. Yes, it’s pure nonsense. You cannot predict where the plot will go or what the characters will do, and that’s entirely the point. It skids from normal to weird to dark to wonderful without taking a breath, and the audience accepts it because it’s orchestrated with such charm and style that in this universe, anything can happen and we don’t mind what it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Why then, did Nick Park feel the need to depart entirely from that universe and shove his characters into a saccharin world of light and faux suspense? The Wrong Trousers followed in 1993, and expands on the idea of Wallace as madcap inventor, with his entire domestic life handled by ‘wacky’ inventions which go wrong (leading to the worst-written line of dialogue in history “they’re the wrong trousers, Gromit, and they’ve gone wrong!”). The general public seemed to accept this turn of events. I did not. In A Grand Day Out, Wallace and Gromit build a fully-functioning rocket ship, which is precisely what you’d build if you want to visit the Moon. They build it despite being set up as a normal old man and his dog, they build it against expectations. That’s what’s clever about it. The Wrong Trousers is closer in tone to Pee Wee than its own origin, with stupid ‘labour-saving’ devices playing a central part. This is kiddy stuff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;At this point the merchandising (also known as ‘the sweetest cherry’) madness begins. Wallace’s gurning face appears on everything from pajamas to breakfast cereal. I don’t mind that, to be honest, it’s no less than I’d do if I invented a franchiseable-character, and if the fanbase is big enough you might as well exploit…sorry, cater to it because otherwise the counterfeiters will. Plus, who is going to turn down millions in revenue? And as The Simpsons showed, you can merchandise the hell out of something right from the start and not compromise the actual art.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Unfortunately, one novelty umbrella too many seems to have taken its toll on Wallace and Gromit because what attempt at clever writing and novel storyline existed in the first instalment and just about in the second was completely missing by A Close Shave (featuring the hilariously-named Shaun the Sheep). This marked the beginning of the ‘pun title’ phase of W&amp;amp;G, for reasons still unfathomable to me. The titles are not consistent in this regard, with Cracking Contraptions and the movie Curse of the Were-Rabbit following. As W&amp;amp;G’s following grew, so did the need to cater for an increasingly diverse audience. The bigger the fanbase, the broader the appeal needs to be. The broader the appeal needs to be, the more dumbing down there is. Which brings us to A Matter of Loaf and Death. Watched by millions, it opens with the murder of a baker, then cuts to our ‘heroes’ running a bakery, for no reason that I care about. A Grand Day Out always gave me the impression that Wallace was retired, spending his last days happily eating cheese and building rockets. Not so. He’s as sprightly as a teenager and immersed in a small enterprise, the world of bread. Thrilling. Enter the female lead, a chubby ex-model who appears to arouse Wallace to the point of crashing his bread van. I don’t want to see Wallace in a state of erect excitement, thanks. Equally, I don’t want to see Gromit falling in ‘puppy love’ with a freaking poodle with eye makeup. You remember Scrappy Doo? There’s a reason why he was Scooby’s nephew and not his son, and that reason is DOG SEX and kiddy viewers don’t mix.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;I can’t say much more about A Matter of Lots of Wealth without spoilers, although suffice to say the plot is so freaking obvious and identical to the last three or four outings that it wouldn’t matter anyway. It seems obvious to me that Wallace and Gromit are money-making machines, formulaic crowd-pleasing ratings-grabbers which take precedent over art or originality. For those of you thinking of watching Loaf and Death, consider A Grand Day Out instead. I promise you’ll be richer for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230853252822"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4689211194802880605">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6389c1e93e495b5e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Happy New Year</title><published>2009-01-01T23:12:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-01T23:40:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2009/01/happy-new-year.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4689211194802880605/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4689211194802880605" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> This is a year to celebrate Charles Darwin and evolution.

&lt;p&gt;Egads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sent this to friends and family, urging them to sign &lt;a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/KeepMike/"&gt;an online petition&lt;/a&gt; that will get sent to Obama. First off, most online petitions aren’t worth the paper they aren’t printed on. Maybe this one will bear weight, who knows. At the time I write this it has over 2000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But second, she &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to have known this would become public. It’s pretty unseemly to have this happen; it’s not normally done for political appointees to ask to keep their jobs in a public way, and to have your spouse do this is a even weirder. Had it remained private that would be different, but she sent this note via email, basically guaranteeing it would get out. The petition, it should be noted, was not started by her, but by former NASA Associate Administrator Scott Horowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I find it hard to believe that Mike Griffin himself didn’t condone this, either actively or passively. It’s possible she didn’t tell him she was going to do this, but she had to have found out about the petition first, and then sent that email. It doesn’t seem likely that she would keep that info from Mr. Griffin. And if she did, then the misjudgment lands at her feet, not his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said before, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/11/nasas-griffin-butting-heads-with-obama/"&gt;I’m ambivalent about Griffin&lt;/a&gt;. He’s done some good things and some bad things. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/04/followup-on-msl-griffins-spin/"&gt;His tendency to wildly spin stories bugs me a lot&lt;/a&gt;, but when it comes down to brass tacks he’s done a lot of good for NASA. I can’t imagine this will help his chances, as it might leave a bad taste with many politicians. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I cleared my hangover on Boxing Day by going for a surf at  Espasante, near my home in Galicia, northern Spain. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;A fisherman — with Anton, the town pig by his side — had been  watching me and he asked, “What happened to you out there?” I tried to  explain, but my Spanish was inadequate. The only way I could say I’d  drunk too much the day before was “estuve borracho” but borracho wasn’t  the word I wanted. To me it implies a bestial, slobbering sort of  drunkenness, which wasn’t quite how it had seemed when I was  celebrating Yuletide with family and friends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We’d feasted, played games with the children, danced, decorated each  other with fluorescent paint, and drank: beer and Cava for the race  down the stream, Albarino with the salmon, Priorat with the suckling  pig, more Cava for musical chairs, Port with the Stilton and roasted  chestnuts, a cleansing ale during the treasure hunt, brandy with the  Christmas pudding, then back to wine and anything else that was open  for dancing. When I fell into bed with my partner I was happy:  inebriated yes, wasted, no. Squiffy rather than sloshed, trashed or  flayed. But how do you say squiffy in Spanish? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea, myself, though perhaps some commenters will have suggestions for Mr. Gately. He may not be grateful, however, since he believes that the availability of an ample vocabulary for varieties of inebriation is a special characteristic of English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;As far as I’m aware, English has the richest vocabulary of any language when it comes to describing the effects of alcohol upon human behavior. I think that that’s because the British have been constant and heavy drinkers for most of their history. From the Anglo-Saxon invasions to the Industrial Revolution, they’ve been getting beodrunken, foxed, tipsy, pie-eyed and woozey. Indeed the English have developed an entire lexicon to express different nuances of the same condition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gately lists a couple of dozen examples, though I have to confess that many of them were entirely new to me ("squiffy", "nimtopsical", "stocious"), and many others have a broader meaning ("woozy", "trammel'd", "merry").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll give the last word to Gately's Galician friends, who may have come up with the requested word for "squiffy":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The fisherman let me flounder on awhile, then said “Estuviste piripi” and left me with Anton the pig, who grunted, urinated on my wetsuit, and also went on his way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230843196752"><id gr:original-id="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=218">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/30702dbdeceff6b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General"/><category term="Human Rights"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">One Quick Look Back</title><published>2009-01-01T20:00:50Z</published><updated>2009-01-01T20:00:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog/?p=218" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.autismstreet.org/weblog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year Autism Street Readers! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that Mirosoft founder, Bill Gates, &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;amp;story_id=11622119"&gt;retired in 2008&lt;/a&gt;? Okay, you probably did. But, did you catch this video? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m typing as softly as I can, because I know some of you are nursing one mother honey of a hangover right now. Last night is no doubt a blur, and hopefully you woke up nude or partially dressed with someone warm and at least mildly attractive next to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not nauseous, you’re going to need something greasy to eat and about a gallon and a half of water soon, just to feel human again. But I won’t offer any homespun remedies, other than the tried and true cure for the hangover: Keep drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, try not to breathe on anyone, turn the lights and music down low, put on some warm, fluffy socks or some slippers, let your bathrobe hang open wide, and let’s use the first Afternoon Inquisition of the new year to commiserate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did you do anything crazy last night? If so, what? And if you’re hungover, how are you dealing with it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The new year is barely unwrapped and I already have to knock some heads together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Oops! I somehow got it in my head that it was NPR promoting this, but it’s not. I’ve corrected my mistake below, and apologies to NPR.]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Now, usually I like National Public Radio. It has intelligent, thoughtful programming, unlike pretty much every other local or national radio station/network.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the &lt;em&gt;frak&lt;/em&gt;  they doing &lt;em&gt;promoting astrology?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Public Media aired a story recently (&lt;a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/31/astrological_economy/"&gt;transcript here&lt;/a&gt;) with what could have been a good premise: economists in general were caught by surprise by the recession. If they are experts in their field, why not go outside the field and see how other prognosticators did? They chose astrologers, which I think could have been very cool; see if any of the big name astrologers predicted this event, especially since they do give money advice to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, APM did a wholly gullible, credulous, and ridiculous puff piece on astrology. It’s galling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3157312644/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3111/3157312644_f428bf7033.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, many news outlets do stuff like this, then make sure they do the story with just enough tongue-in-cheekiness and snark that they can say &amp;quot;Oh, we weren’t taking it seriously!&amp;quot; But if you read the transcript of the APM story I don’t see that being the case. And &lt;a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/31/astrological_economy/"&gt;on that page&lt;/a&gt; they give a huge amount of space to the astrologers themselves to promulgate their antiscientific garbage, including casting charts for Obama, the US, and the Federal Reserve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not ask the Easter Bunny what he thinks while they’re at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A far more interesting and useful story would have been to collect as many pre-market collapse predictions about the economy from astrologers that can be found, and see how many of them actually saw it coming. I bet the answer is very, very low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, folks, repeat after me: &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;Astrology doesn’t work&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as APM goes, shame on you. I’ll note that at the bottom of the APM web page you can leave comments. I urge people to do so, but remember, BE POLITE. You can be strong and you can be firm, but please don’t be rude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a note: whenever I write about astrology, I get a bunch astrologers leaving comments about how I don’t understand it, how I haven’t researched it, how I haven’t seen what they can do. Wrong, wrong, and wrong. I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; researched it, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; understand it, and I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; seen what astrologers can do. If you’re soft on astrology,  &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html"&gt;please read what I wrote on my website first&lt;/a&gt; before leaving a comment here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://astronomy2009.org"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And what a year it will be: it’s the International Year of Astronomy, a 365-day long celebration of the coolest science there is. The idea is simple: promote astronomy, and increase everyone’s awareness of the Universe around them. A noble effort, and one I support wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways you can participate. First things first: go to &lt;a href="http://astronomy2009.org"&gt;the IYA2009&lt;/a&gt; website, and spend some time poking around there. That is the central hub of the effort, with a huge amount of information on how you can participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal suggestion is to throw a star party. Invite your neighbors to see the planets or the Moon through a telescope (if you don’t have one, find someone in your area who does). Joining or just contacting an astronomy club would help. &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bitesize/astroclubs.html"&gt;I have links to find one near you on the old site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A star party might take a while to set up, but there are things you can do right now. There are so many online activities! There are three I particularly like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cosmicdiary.org/"&gt;Cosmic Diary&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;The Cosmic Dairy aims to put a human face on astronomy: professional scientists will blog in text and images about their lives, families, friends, hobbies and interests, as well as their work, their latest research findings and the challenges that face them.&amp;quot; There are several posts up already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://365daysofastronomy.org/"&gt;365 Days of Astronomy Podcast&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;a project that will publish one podcast per day, for all 365 days of 2009. The podcast episodes are written, recorded and produced by people around the world.&amp;quot; And by people, they mean &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. This is a participatory effort, where anyone who wants to can submit an entry. Head over there, pick a day, pick a topic, and record your cosmic thought! And the first one is already up. I love the intro music; it’s by skeptic and science junkie &lt;a href="http://www.geologicrecords.net/"&gt;George Hrab&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social Networks: IYA 2009 is on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2393682023"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&amp;amp;friendID=180774573"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/astronomy2009"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Join us there, and that way you’ll get updates and be sure to keep up with the latest news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a regular reader here, you know how much I love astronomy, and how much I love to share that love. So join me, and join all my friends, colleagues, and fellow sky-lovers. Share astronomy with someone!&lt;/p&gt;

And while I'm not happy about the reason for it, I'm still thankful for all the friends I sometimes forget I have.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I found out from many of my friends is that if I post a piece on my facebook page, they'll read it.  But they won't necessarily come here to read my other stuff.  Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing discussion here in the blogosphere sometimes needs an interruption, a break to remember what it is we do here, if anything.  I'm not big on "Top 10" or other similar New Years posts, so for 2009, I'm going to explain to you who the hell I am, what my writing is about, and why you really should read it.  Really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, blog reading 101.  Blogs, a shortening of "weblog", is an online writing form existing somewhere in the space between self-absorbed adolescent diary and journalism.  Blogs themselves have certain conventions that print media don't.  For example, when reading a blog post, and encountering a link, this link often leads to another blog or article that expands on the underlined idea, without having to make a major digression.  Blogs can also be read in rss feeds, which is an easy format for glancing through your favorite writers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hoofnagle brothers (those handsome lads pictured at the left) started the denialism blog quite a while ago because they saw a pattern. Certain issues in science and the news seemed to attract a certain type of wacko.  For example, there is a large and somewhat influential community that denies that HIV causes AIDS.   This pissed them off.  What the Hoofnagles recognized is that this "denialism" may infect many issues (AIDS, global warming, the Holocaust, evolution, to name a few), but the tactics, the logical errors, remain the same.  People who deny the Holocaust happened use the same tactics as those who claim AIDS is something other than HIV infection.  Those of us who follow these (very harmful and often hateful) movements have noticed how the people involved use certain tactics over and over to try to show the public how "reasonable" they are.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of denialism roots out these tactics, reveals these patterns, and shows these folks to be what they really are---charlatans, hate-mongers, corporate shills, and sometimes just poor, deluded souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing myself almost two years ago at a blog I called &lt;a href="http://whitecoatunderground.com"&gt;White Coat Underground&lt;/a&gt;.  I didn't have a plan so much as to just write about whatever interested me.  Apparently my writing interested others as well, because the readership grew. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/01/happy_new_year_now_who_are_you.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2009/01/happy_new_year_now_who_are_you.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/500276061" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230822409662"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/nominated_again_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/080912ea164c33d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">Nominated again!</title><published>2009-01-01T14:00:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-01T14:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/500217358/nominated_again_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/nominated_again_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://2008.weblogawards.org/site-news/2008-weblog-awards-finalists/"&gt;&lt;img alt="2008 Weblog Awards logo" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/wa2008_200x100.jpg" width="200" height="100" style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I realize that I said I would take New Years Day off, but I saw this and felt a brief post was in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realize that some will never believe that it's not false modesty when I express amazement that so many people show up here day in and day out to read my written meanderings. It's also not false modesty when I marvel that I actually am nominated from time to time for various blogging awards and even (on rarer occasions) &lt;a href="http://2006.weblogawards.org/2006/12/the_2006_weblog_award_winners.php"&gt;win&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is again that I've been nominated for &lt;a href="http://2008.weblogawards.org/site-news/2008-weblog-awards-finalists/"&gt;Best Medical/Health Issues Blog&lt;/a&gt; of 2008 for the &lt;a href="http://www.weblogawards.org"&gt;Weblog Awards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool. My thanks to everyone who nominated me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also notice one very excellent blog, &lt;a href="http://www.autismvox.com/"&gt;Autism Vox&lt;/a&gt;, as one of the other nominees, which is also very cool. If I can't win it, I'd love to see Kristina Chew win it. One interesting blog that I hadn't been aware of include &lt;a href="http://www.jpouch.net/"&gt;UC Story to J-pouch Life&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I don't do much GI surgery anymore (and hence don't do ileostomies anymore), as a trained general surgeon I might have to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I also note that &lt;a href="http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Junkfood Science&lt;/a&gt; has been nominated as well. Although Sandy Szwarc &lt;a href="http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2008/12/surprising-link-between-ufos-and.html"&gt;can actually be very good&lt;/a&gt; when she is discussing medical matters outside of obesity, diet, and cholesterol, her sound skepticism all too often tends to be trumped by her highly dubious "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/fake_experts/sandy_szwarc/"&gt;what me, worry?&lt;/a&gt;" stands on anything having to do with obesity, minimizing at ever opportunity the health dangers attributable to diet through her &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/bushwells/2008/05/children_eating_disorders_and.php"&gt;mastery of selective data presentation&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. "cherry picking) and&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=251"&gt; truly risible&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/10/obesity_and_diet_the_first_law_of_thermodynamics.php"&gt;thermodynamics arguments&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from Szwarc, from what I can tell, any of the nominees would be worthy recipients of the award; so here's hoping that, whoever wins, it isn't her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/01/nominated_again_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/500217358" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230821005167"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5117">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a5c3452d53b8b05d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="alternative medicine"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 1.1</title><published>2009-01-01T14:21:11Z</published><updated>2009-01-01T14:21:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5117" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Maggiore died at 52 at home on December 26th. At this time there is no official cause of death, but she was treated over the last six months for pneumonia, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hLV5-uH0jNm_LWiyeDcj7yEHS4iAD95DAKP00"&gt;according to reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggiore founded Alive &amp;amp; Well, a group dedicated to the notion that HIV does not cause AIDS, in 1993 and since that time has been a fervent advocate of so-called HIV denial. In fact she argued that her own survival as an untreated person with HIV was evidence that HIV does not cause AIDS. It is now recognized, however, that some people have inherent resistance to HIV and researchers are learning more about the &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2005/01/66198"&gt;genetics of such resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggiore’s dedication to HIV denial, however, still had tragic consequences. She decided to breast feed both her children, despite the fact that breast feeding increases the risk of contracting the virus. Her daughter, Eliza, &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/09/another-tragically-unnecessary-death.html"&gt;died at the age of 3&lt;/a&gt; apparently from pneumonia that was likely an opportunistic infection due to advanced AIDS. She never had her children tested or treated for HIV.  Her pediatrician, interestingly, was anti-vaccine crank &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt;. He claims to support the conclusion that HIV causes AIDS, but his website used to contain some squirely comments on HIV that suggested he may have had some denialist sympathies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maggiore never acknowledged that her daughter’s death was due to HIV or AIDS. The HIV denial community rallied around her, claiming the death was due to an allergic reaction to amoxicillin. Denial is a powerful thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/maggiorecoroner.pdf"&gt;autopsy report&lt;/a&gt; is unequivocal. There was strong evidence that Eliza had an advanced case of AIDS from HIV, including AIDS encephalitis (brain infection). Her cause of death was pneumocystis carinii pneumonia caused by AIDS - this is a common opportunistic infection in AIDS and extremely rare in an immunocompetent individual. The autopsy left no reasonable doubt that Eliza died from complications of AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course there is always room for unreasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence that HIV causes AIDS is now overwhelming. There are always deeper complexities to such questions, but the basic fact the a viral infection causes the clinical syndrome of AIDS is well-established. Treatments aimed at HIV delay the onset of AIDS and have greatly extended the life expectancy of HIV positive patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet it is apparently a common human cognitive vulnerability that we find conspiracy theories compelling - some people much more than others. The notion that HIV is a big lie perpetrated by Big Pharma and a complicit medical establishment enthralls some. Once inside that world, then all of the complexities that normally attend any complex medical (or historical or scientific) phenomenon can be twisted and made to seem as if they cast doubt on well-established facts. All contradictory evidence can be dismissed as part of a conspiracy, or rationalized away (HIV deniers, for example, argued that pneumonia is common, so why blame Eliza’s case on HIV - ignoring the conclusive evidence from the autopsy). Confirmation bias sets in - and that turns suspicions into unshakable beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/articles.asp?id=23"&gt;Denialism&lt;/a&gt; itself is a special form of pseudoscience.  Denialists are pseudoskeptics - they pretent to apply the principles of skepticism (doubt) but they are dedicated to a final conclusion, and so they twist the process to their desired outcome. For example, denialists wrongly apply criteria, they constantly move the goalpost, they cherry pick evidence as necessary. They behave like any other pseudoscientist, but with the goal of denying a scientific conclusion that is probably true rather than establishing one that is probably not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, there is a very human dimension to these issues and very personal tragedies. My sympathies are with Maggiore’s family at her untimely death around the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we also must remember that Christine Maggiore put herself at the center of a popular controversy. She put her own unscientific beliefs ahead of the scientific community, with tragic consequences. And in the end she turned her own life story into a cautionary tale about the dangers of pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were asked by Steve to give our 2008 skeptical heroes, douchebags, SGU moments and favourite quotes.   Since I couldn’t be on the show, I thought I’d share my skeptical hero for 2008 here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My skeptical hero for 2008 has been the same person since I discovered the skeptical movement.  Steven Novella.  There were plenty of skeptics in 2008 would would also fit into this category, most notably the people on &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4996"&gt;Rebecca’s list&lt;/a&gt;.  But to me it’s Steve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008 Steve continued to bring science, skepticism and critical thinking to over 45,000 sets of ears every week through his tireless efforts prepping, producing and editing the most popular and recognized skeptical podcast on the planet (and dare I say, the universe).  At the beginning of the year Steve added to his podcasting duties by hosting the weekly companion podcast to the SGU, the SGU 5×5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of you know Steve writes for a few blogs.  He has his own in which he writes almost daily, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/"&gt;NeuroLogica&lt;/a&gt;.  He also contributes weekly (and sometimes twice a week) to the Rogues’ Gallery.   In 2008 Steve added two more blogs under his belt.  &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/"&gt;SkepticBlog&lt;/a&gt;.  Steve continues to produce top quality articles for 4 seperate blogs every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn’t enough, in 2008, Steve went to California to shoot the pilot to what I hope will become a regular TV show about science and skepticism, &lt;a href="http://www.skeptologists.com/"&gt;The Skeptologists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve reads every single email that makes its way to the SGU’s inbox.  He also makes himself very accessible to all his listeners by participating in live skeptical events.  In 2008 Steve was at TAM6, DragonCon and hosted The Perry DeAngelis Memorial event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of all that Steve finds time to spend with his lovely wife and two wonderful daughters.  He is also always there for his friends when they need advice or just want to play some online gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I hear he’s an academic neurologist at some backwater university called “Yale”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this and much more, I am confident in my choice for my skeptical hero for 2008.  And I am very proud and honoured to be able to consider Steve a good friend of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;Next week I will not be fulfilling my blogging duties, I will be basking in the warm Cuban sun with a Cuban cigar in mouth and some sweet Cuban rum in hand.
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I love travelling and when we go to these tropical islands to relax and get away from the Canadian winters, I find there’s no better way than to lose myself in a good book with the warm sun shining down on me and the sound of the ocean in the background.  Here’s what I’m bringing to Cuba with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:right;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;img title="Crystal Skulls" src="http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/pic/TRND/FP9332~Indiana-Jones-and-the-Kingdom-Of-The-Crystal-Skull-Posters.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="450"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;10) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people have done more over the years to bring pseudo-archaeology, looting, and biblical literalism to the masses than Indiana Jones.  In his latest film Indy deals with ancient astronauts, one of the most longstanding piles of horse manure in archaeology.   While Indy continues to further the inaccurate and illegal image of archaeologists to the public, this film does have a number of references to real archaeological theories and a few points where Indy’s disregard for cultural patrimony are addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9)&lt;strong&gt;Dr. James Tabor’s Statistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tabor’s treatment of the Talpiot Tomb is ranked so low, because it’s really yesterday’s news.   Most archaeologists are over the subject, and realize that Biblical Archaeology is still stuck in the past.  Never the less, Tabor has spent the last year saying,  “in fact it is very close to 1/2, meaning if we had two tombs to examine, one of them would be the Jesus tomb.”  This is, of course, a dramatically incorrect statement of statistics and interpretation.   Oh well, maybe next year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 ) &lt;strong&gt;The Queen of Sheba’s Palace (Tie)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;amp;sid=aHkn1LT4dQcU&amp;amp;refer=germany"&gt;Bloomburg News&lt;/a&gt; reported that a German research group that set out to find the Ark of the Covenant had found the palace of the Queen of Sheba in Axum Ethiopia.   This might be a bit problematic for the number of scholars that don’t think Sheba was in Ethiopia.   This was a largely unreported story in the US though, circulating mostly through religious blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 ) &lt;strong&gt;Proof of Romulus and Remus (Tie) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists in Rome found a cave, that was likely a ritual site.   From this, they extrapolated that Rome was actually founded by Romulus.  Don’t get the jump yourself?  Neither did P.E. Wiseman from Exeter, who proved his name appropriate when he mentioned how impossible such claims are in archaeology. (Link &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2008-02-06-romulus-remus-lupercale_N.htm?csp=34"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) &lt;strong&gt;10,000 BC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film brought a new image of the past to the public, unfortunately, it left its historical accuracy behind.   Really, there was little accurate at all in this film, and it avoided all the interesting things that were actually occurring at this point in human history.   To no one’s big surprise, it met with poor reviews and was essentially a grandiose flop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;strong&gt;Muslim Sailors in Skeptic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourth issue of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic &lt;/em&gt;for 2008, Tim Callahan put together a generally good piece on ancient super cultures.  Unfortunately, it was marred by his own personal belief in pre-Columbian contact between Arab sailors and the New World.   It’s hard to see &lt;em&gt;Skeptic &lt;/em&gt;support such pseudo-science, which is why this event made it so high on my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Oldest Hebrew Writing Discovered&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… or was it?  There are a number of problems with the text.  First, it may not be Hebrew at all.  Second, the dating is still not as exact as needed.  Finally, the claims that go with it concern proving the bible.   However, it says nothing about the bible (presumably, since it hasn’t been desciphered yet), and is instead used as evidence that stories could be passed down.   Niditch has repeatedly made the point that texts aren’t even necessary for this, and I would add that even if they existed, they don’t prove the stories true. (Link &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/11/081103-hebrew-text.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Looting Archaeologists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just recently posted on this topic.   Hershel Shanks, editor of &lt;em&gt;Biblical Archaeology Review&lt;/em&gt; called for museums to fund archaeological research by buying artifacts.  However, this throws out ethics and science turning archaeologists into treasure hunters.  Instead of entertaining us with Indy, Mr. Shanks would turn us all into him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Cable Television&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable television has continued its downward slide with respect to archaeology.  &lt;em&gt;Nova&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The History Channel, The Discovery Channel&lt;/em&gt;, and other media have grown much more interested in discussing the bible code, historical realities of the bible, or aliens at Tunguska.  On top of this, they have added adventurers and actors, like Simcha Jacobovici, who remove the context of archaeology from the shows by a further step.   While this is a major problem with the public portrayal of archaeology, the presence of Turin Shrine shows and secret society histories on this channels is so long running that it has become numbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Creationist Museum and the Cincinnati Zoo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cincinnati Zoo decided that it would offer a special ticked allowing reduced prices for those who also attended a Christmas event at the Kentucky Creationist House of Lies… er Museum.  This would have been an even bigger event, had the museum not folded like a map when the remainder of the nation found out about it and inundated them with angry calls and emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Kofels Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Medkeff, who’s passing the skeptics of the world mourned this year, covered this topic quite well &lt;a href="http://bluecollarscientist.com/2008/04/01/a-sumerian-observation-of-the-kofels-impact-almost-certainly-not/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Essentially, a clay tablet with no current translation was stated as representing an impact at the site of Kofels by a meteorite.  Well, as Jeff noted, there was no impact, no crator, and no meteorite.  So why make this all up?   To sell a book of course.    This piece of pseudo-archaeology makes it to number 1 for 2008, because it is perhaps the greatest intellectual fraud of the year in archaeology, as every single noteworthy part of the work is basically a fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s it for 2008, I hope everyone had a good year, and that next year is even better.   I am sure I will be back with ten more stories in 2009, so get ready.&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, women are often confined to their houses, denied an education and, if they leave their houses, they must (in many conservative religious Moslem countries) be covered often with the berka from heard to toe to keep men from any sexual lustful thoughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Covering of the female can be a basic hijab to the full face covering of the burqa. Woman are not to be seen except by her husband and as one Pashto phrase states: “A woman belongs in the house - or in a grave.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Desires in Heaven in Islam: Very Good!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Two points need to be noted. First, there is no mention anywhere in the Koran of the actual number of virgins available in paradise, and second, the dark-eyed damsels are available for all Muslims, not just martyrs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…and…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Modern apologists of Islam try to downplay the evident materialism and sexual implications of such descriptions, but, as the Encyclopaedia of Islam says, even orthodox Muslim theologians such as al Ghazali (died 1111 CE) and Al-Ash'ari (died 935 CE) have "admitted sensual pleasures into paradise". The sensual pleasures are graphically elaborated by Al-Suyuti (died 1505 ), Koranic commentator and polymath. He wrote: ‘Each time we sleep with a houri we find her virgin. Besides, the penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint. Each chosen one [ie Muslim] will marry seventy [sic] houris, besides the women he married on earth, and all will have appetising vaginas.’”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[I must admit that after reading the statement “Besides, the penis of the Elected never softens. The erection is eternal; the sensation that you feel each time you make love is utterly delicious and out of this world and were you to experience it in this world you would faint.” the Lord immediately started dealing with my heart. I really think the Lord is calling me to be a Moslem!] (&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/jan/12/books.guardianreview5"&gt;Quoted from here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth on Earth in Christianity: Very Bad!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Jesus of the Gospels is an itinerate preacher who owns nothing (Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head." Matt. 8: 20).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tells anyone who follows him to do the same (Looking at him, Jesus felt a love for him and said to him, "One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me. But at these words he was saddened, and he went away grieving, for he was one who owned much property. " Mark 10: 21-22).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warns about loving wealth and getting into Heaven (“For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." Luke 18: 25).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus teaches a “Social Gospel” on sharing of wealth the Jewish punishment if you don’t (19 “Now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day. 20 “And a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, … Luke 16: 19 -31).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth in Heaven in Christianity: Very Good!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;God has a mansion in Heaven with a dedicated room for each faithful believer (2 “In My Father’s house are many dwelling places (Greek: rooms); if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. 3 “If I go and prepare a place for you… John 14: 1-3 Talk about Circular Reasoning!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the faithful are forbidden to love and horde wealth on earth, in Heaven greed is king as the faithful’s material lust is filled to over flowing (19 The foundation stones of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation stone was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; 20 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst. 21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each one of the gates was a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. Rev. 21: 19 - 21).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus said: “Rejoice and be glad because you have a great reward in heaven!” (Matt. 5: 12a)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yea, right! Unlimited sex for the faithful Moslem and unlimited wealth for the faithful Christian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I see religious hypocrisy here or is it just because my atheistic mind is not warped by religious righteous thinking? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, I'm going to make some random predictions for this year. They range from science to politics and come in no particular order. If I do well, I might even repost this next year and see how right I was. &lt;/p&gt;

You can find out more at &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/12/30/oh-no-ive-seen-the-impossible-my-eyes/"&gt;The Loom&lt;/a&gt;, where Carl shows people riding single-wheel bikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am only weighing in because the discussion seems to be overlooking an important point about exaptation/co-option: the function need not be the same in both instances.  So, although riding a bike with one wheel the way you would ride a two-wheeled bike a la wheelie is fine to show that it wouldn't be totally non-functional, an even more relevant counter-example would involve a bicycle with one wheel that worked well &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;for some other role&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Voila.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://homelessdave.com/images/laundrypanaroma.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0px auto 10px;display:block;text-align:center;width:433px;height:269px" src="http://homelessdave.com/images/laundrypanaroma.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://homelessdave.com/hdwashingman.htm"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just the first single-wheeled, functional-for-something-different, co-option example I found. This actually involves one shift and one addition of function.  Loss of wheel to make it useful for exercise indoors, then addition of other parts to run a laundry machine.  Of course, modern &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_bicycle"&gt;stationary bicycles&lt;/a&gt; used for exercise are more specialized, but you can still find gear to convert a normal bicycle into a stationary one, sometimes by taking off the front wheel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, basically, bicycles with one wheel provide a very nice illustration of how co-option with shift in function can and does work.&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/Jdkn8XbmHlQ" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230773995981"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=628">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0aad96ac9bc52df</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="bidness"/><title type="html">Cost Innovation vs. Product Innovation</title><published>2008-12-31T20:13:04Z</published><updated>2008-12-31T20:13:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=628" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;My last post about the automobile industry was inspired by some comments I had left in response to Cuban’s post on Hacker News, a tech-themed site I often read. The comments weren’t well-received, largely (I think, given the well-received responses to it) because they implied that innovation, at least in terms of improving the product, couldn’t solve this particular dilemma. Now that I think about it, I’m not surprised. A hacker (as the term is meant there) is almost by definition an innovator, so the people there tend to value innovation above all else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just innovation, but a certain sort of innovation, the sort the user sees. Y Combinator’s mantra is &amp;quot;make something people want&amp;quot;, with the theory being that if you do that, all else will fall in line. While that’s largely true with software, it’s not the same in the manufacturing world because what people want, often more than the product itself, is to pay less money for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I value innovation as much as anyone else. I think humanity can solve almost all of our problems with science and reason. In fact, the automobile industry, including the American car companies, has knocked out more than their fair share of woes. The price of transportation as a percentage of overall income has been dropping for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I came to realize that innovation means different things in different industries. In much of the tech world, especially on the web, innovation means nothing more than making a better product from the end user’s perspective. It’s clear that even if it cost Google 2x as much per search to operate as it does Yahoo, they’d still be making a lot more money. The same is true of most any web startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for that is twofold. For one, the apparent cost to the user is $0. Technically users are paying to use both services, and more on Google than on Yahoo, but they’re doing it in a circuitous way by clicking advertisements and then purchasing things on the pages on which they land. It’s sort of a happy payment, since those Google or Yahoo ads are taking you to pages you wanted to spend money on. They’re scratching an itch. The fact that users &amp;quot;pay&amp;quot; more to use Google actually makes them happy. Nobody wants to pay more for a typical mid-sized sedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason is that two times zero is still zero, and the cost of serving up a page is, for most web companies, effectively zero. I know a lot of people who run a lot of startups, and not once has anyone ever mentioned to me what it costs for them to serve up a page view. With the exception of the startups that primarily serve up large files (YouTube for instance) most have probably never checked. Hardware and bandwidth are so cheap when sending mainly html and a few images that until you’re serving millions of customers per day it wouldn’t even be worth the man hours it takes to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, most startups don’t really worry too much about optimizing in terms of hardware costs. They just try to get to a point where scaling is just slapping in more boxes, which granted, is often a hard point to get to but only costs man hours. The marginal cost of a page view is still nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, marginal cost doesn’t even make sense as a metric for most web-based businesses. The vast majority of the expense comes from the engineering it takes to get to where you can slap in more servers. The time spent figuring out how to shard your database costs orders of magnitude more than the hardware you do it on. It’s an industry that’s almost entirely fixed costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In manufacturing, marginal cost means everything. That was the primary source of innovation for Henry T. Ford exactly 100 years ago. He didn’t invent the car, and he didn’t even make a higher quality one. He made a cheaper one by perfecting processes, such as the assembly line, that reduced the marginal cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, for instance, that a Toyota Camry costs $50 million per year to engineer, but sells 1 million units. That’s a cost of only $50 per unit worth of engineering for a car that retails for something like $25,000 on average. The product innovation expense is trivial. It’s a tiny fraction of a percent, essentially a rounding error. For a car that costs $15,000 to build, the labor and raw materials are the overwhelming concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation in the automobile industry has, for a century now, been more about reducing marginal costs than improving the product. They’ve been essentially doing the real world equivalent of rewriting your whole website in C, which every startup would be doing if serving up a page view cost them even $1 worth of processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that’s the primary difference between the automobile and software industries. One is primarily about making the product better, the other primarily about making it cheaper. Both require innovation, just two very different kinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even with both types of innovation, in an efficient marketplace, one company can’t be expected to significantly out-innovate another because it’s too easy to copy. You can’t patent the concept of an SUV. You can’t even usefully patent something like rain-sensing wipers (presumably, since multiple manufacturers offer them) because someone can trivially improve upon them or anything else you do. It’s not like a drug, where a precise chemical compound could have wild variations from one that was only 90% the same. (Pharmaceuticals are another industry in which the marginal cost is considerably less a factor than research and development.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And really, I don’t think we’ve seen a discrepancy in terms of product innovation occur in the automobile industry. It’s hard to say because it hasn’t been a fair fight, but Americans have clearly had their share of hits. The largest trend in cars over the past decade would be the SUV, and they’ve led the charge there. Of the top 15 best selling, they produce all but numbers 2, 9, and 15. They own the pickup truck market just as well. The Mustang has been the top selling sports car for 22 years. And GM still has the world’s largest market share, though just barely. They’ve clearly been making cars people want for a long time, even while doing so at a tremendous cost disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I view innovation in any competitive industry a lot like Olympic running. You would never expect a runner to finish 10% faster than the second or third best. For instance in this year’s 100m final, Usain Bolt set the world record of 10.2 seconds. Second place was 10.24, or 0.39% behind. The reason for that is simple, you’re taking a selected group of the best runners, all of whom put everything they have into it, all of whom have access to the same technology and practices. Is it therefore surprising that they all tend to perform similarly? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are like that. There’s a lot of variance in a random sample, and Bolt might be able to finish in only half the time I could. But when you take the best tiny fraction of a percent, you find that they’re all pretty damn close to each other in ability. That’s no less true of automotive engineers than it is runners. Unless you believe in some sort of genetic superiority, you can’t expect the best American engineers to perform significantly better than the best Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re doing to our automobile industry, in forcing upon them such a tremendous cost basis, is taking the second best guy in Usain Bolt’s record-setting race and giving him a 2 second head start. And when we do that, it doesn’t matter how bright our guys are, or how hard they work, or how well they execute, because the competition is going to be at least 99.5% as good. It’s human nature. Our team might finish less than two seconds behind, and in fact I think they have, but the other guys are really fast too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we’re a little better, and we might be, it’s not by much, and it shouldn’t be, and no matter what we do it never will be. To think otherwise is simply racist, and it’s provably wrong. The Japanese and Germans have their fair share of bright, hard working people (hell, a lot of them are Americans) and we just can’t expect to beat them in a race while starting that far behind the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why the Detroit bosses want to level out the playing field. They want everyone starting from the same place. Unless the competition just gets lazy, in the global economy it’s the only way they have a fighting chance. And if we’re going to bail them out and invest American tax payer money into their future, we owe it to our citizens to stop letting our opponents jump the gun. &lt;/p&gt;

What I said is kinda technically correct, but I should be clearer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that the tides from the Sun and Moon slow the Earth, and that’s why we need to add leap seconds every now and again. But even if we were to remove that effect, we’d &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; need to add leap seconds. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have two clocks. One thinks there are 86,400 seconds in a day, the other thinks that there are 86,401, so the second clock runs a tad bit slower than the first. Every day, it’s one second behind, clicking over to midnight one second after the first clock does. Mind you, it keeps accurate time according to its own gears: every day has 86,401 seconds, so it’s not slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to keep it synchronized with the other clock, we’d either have to subtract a second from the second clock (yikes, terminology is a bit confusing there!) or add one to the first clock every day. So we’d need a leap second every day, but not because the clock is slowing. It’s only because it runs at a different (but constant) rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing with the atomic clock and the Earth. The folks in charge of measuring time needed a standard day length, and so they chose the length of the day as it was in the year 1900. But the Earth has slowed since then, and continues to slow. However, even if we could remove the influence of the Sun and the Moon, the Earth would still be rotating at a different rate now than it was 109 years ago. That rate would now be constant, but slow compared to the standard day. So we’d &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have to add a leap second to the atomic clock to match the slower Earth. In fact, one is added almost every year now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a subtle but important effect. It’s easy to simply extrapolate how much the Earth is slowing and say, hey, it’ll stop completely in a few thousand years (I’ve seen creationists make that claim). But that’s not correct; we’re only talking about adjusting for two different rates, which gives an accumulated difference. That would happen whether the Earth continued to slow or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html"&gt;The Naval Observatory page has more about this&lt;/a&gt;.

He takes it very personally, even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I am familiar with these kinds of attacks. In one single forum at Antievolution.org, created and owned by a former National Center for Science Education staff member, I have been called no less than "Bizarre ignoramus," "retarded," "suck-up," "Pathetic Loser," "attack mouse, gerbil, rat, or clockwork powered plush toy," "an orc," "Annoying," "a miserable loser with no life," "an idiot," "dishonest," "ignorant cheap poxied floozie," "fanatic and lunatic," "A proven liar," "incompetent," and many other far more colorful attacks which are probably best left unprinted here on Evolution News and Views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Casey, I will concede this: I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re retarded at all. The rest…heh. Those are pretty darned accurate, especially &amp;quot;incompetent&amp;quot;. You might want to consider that when someone like you, who knows nothing at all about biology, stands up and makes ignorant comments about the subject and sends them out as press releases all over the country, you&amp;#39;re going to get noticed, and you are going to get assessed. And, Casey, I&amp;#39;m sorry to say — you fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll note that I also stand up and say what I think (with rather better qualifications as a biologist than you), and I also get a lot of flak, including many exceptionally insulting characterizations from your side of the fence. Here's another difference between us, though: I don't keep a running tally of all the names, adjectives, and adverbs applied to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what have you got? A great big Oracle database with urls and citations and photographs and addresses, tracking everyone who insults you? It would have to consume a substantial chunk of the resources of the Discovery Institute to store them all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/poor_casey.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/499806923" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230768519822"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/a_poll_with_a_point.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/49b280313bfff4d8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">A poll with a point</title><published>2008-12-31T23:09:19Z</published><updated>2008-12-31T23:09:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/499806924/a_poll_with_a_point.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/a_poll_with_a_point.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Get out there and vote on this recommendation to Obama to &lt;a title="Change.org - Ideas for Changing America: Create nationally required science standards" href="http://www.change.org/ideas/view/create_nationally_required_science_standards"&gt;create nationally required science standards&lt;/a&gt;.

New Year’s Eves somehow aren’t quite what they used to be once you have small children. Apart from anything else, exhausted parents have a tendency to be pretty much comatose long before the witching hour of midnight.

I’ve already posted two Top 10 of 2008 lists, so I promise this is my last standard end-of-year/start-of-new-year post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last January, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=830"&gt;I set some goals for myself&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s see how I did! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Rock harder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely managed to do this. More conferences, more fun, more travel, more rock shows, and I had an asteroid named after me. Plus I got guitar pick earrings for Christmas, so I am now pre I hit all my (more minor, but still important) goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Getting the Skepchick &amp;amp; Skepdude calendars out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check! This was all about the amazing, gorgeous AB Kovaks, without whom we wouldn’t have done jack. Thanks, A!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. New site layout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check! After three failed redesigns offered by designers offering pro bono services, I finally just did it myself and nearly a year later, I’m still happy with it. I’ll be tweaking things of course, but overall it fits us quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. More blog updates, contests, prizes, snark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check! These were all thanks to my awesome co-writers, most of whom were added this year. Elyse and Jill took over contests, Amanda and Jen began posting daily link dumps in the form of the Quickies, and everyone chipped in with copious amounts of snarkiness. You ladies rocked out loud this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The radio show&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half-a-check. Maybe a quarter. I didn’t get funding from the CPB, but we started doing Skepchick podcasts, which now have about 4,000 subscribers. So I’m making up for it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. The Skeptics’ Guide podcast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check! I wanted to keep it up every week, and I did. It’s still fun. Score!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Gatherings of Various Sorts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check! TAM5.5 was a blast, TAM6 was a nonstop party, and best of all, I did in fact manage to set up a monthly Skeptics in the Pub here in Boston, which is continuing in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, that’s a damned good showing, I think. Now for some predictions and hopes for 2009:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Rock EVEN HARDER THAN BEFORE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shall include figurative and literal rocking, encompassing the following list of action items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to play the piano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to play the keytar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy a keytar in a really rad color, like fluorescent zebra stripes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver a few highly entertaining talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Book more great guests for &lt;a href="http://www.bostonskeptics.com"&gt;Boston Skeptics in the Pub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produce more quality Skepchick podcasts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to do a handstand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record some video blogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach 2,000 &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/RebeccaWatson"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; friends so we can all have a pizza party&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean my apartment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a song for the keytar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform my song on my keytar at The Amaz!ng Meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Befriend a chemist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what I’ve got so far, but I’ll be adding to the list, for sure. Leave your suggestions for how I can rock harder in the new year, including how I can make Skepchick better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And happy new year, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230757397216"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4613221296531991581">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c05b94859bc8dad8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Preacher Dane Eidson Declares Himself an Atheist!</title><published>2008-12-31T16:15:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-01T00:44:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/499564188/preacher-dane-eidson-declares-himself.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/preacher-dane-eidson-declares-himself.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://rantinglunacy.blogspot.com/2008/12/coming-out-of-theism-closet.html"&gt;Dane credits Joe E.

Others know me as the former host of a local cable TV program called "Out of the Box" that was seen in the southeastern parts of Georgia and anywhere through the internet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I am about to state is honest and not a sudden decision on my part. This has been my belief for years. I been living and preaching what I knew was a lie. I have denied and ran from my belief because I was scared to admit this publically. I was afraid of hurting my family and friends and did not want to face what my family would think of me. I was afraid of what could be the consequences of making public my belief. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay...Here's the "big announcement." I am an atheist. I do not believe in God or any other type of diety. I do not believe in a Supreme Being. I once did. But no longer. There is no God, there is no afterlife, there are no spirits. We exist purely by chance and by accident. We are the products of an evolution of a great event, "The Big Bang." Evolution is a fact and belief in a god is the product on man himself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

For all &lt;em&gt;practical&lt;/em&gt; purposes, it’s just another day, with no special attribute that makes it objectively superior for turning over a new leaf. I suppose it’s a good excuse to drink, but those aren’t hard to find on even the most ordinary day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans’ love of round numbers has been documented and exploited (see $ *.99 on virtually every price tag…or the “10″ commandments [why not 9?], etc.), and January 1st inspires many to start fresh, and change the things they don’t like about themselves/their life. And that can’t be bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you making a New Year’s resolution this year? If so, what is it? If not, why not?  &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stacey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230753988324"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_celia_farber_weighs_on.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/dd4d3144f9dd45d5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">HIV/AIDS denialist Celia Farber on the death of Christine Maggiore: It was a "radical detox" regimen, not HIV</title><published>2008-12-31T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-31T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/499611224/hivaids_denialist_celia_farber_weighs_on.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_celia_farber_weighs_on.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php"&gt;commented on the tragic death of HIV/AIDS denialist Christine Maggiore&lt;/a&gt;, who was HIV-positive herself and refused to use antiretroviral drugs during her pregnancy to prevent maternal-fetal transmission of the virus and insistence on breast feeding even though the virus can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk. Her cultish clinging to the belief  that HIV does not cause AIDS against all scientific evidence showing otherwise cost her daughter her life in 2005 and, very likely, cost her her own life a few days ago. I concede that it is quite possible that Maggiore did not die of AIDS, but the circumstances surrounding her death, from what I can glean from news reports, are damned suspicious for for an AIDS-associated pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave it to HIV/AIDS denialist crank Celia Farber, writing on on the blog of that HIV/AIDS denialist blogger Dean Esmay (who, by the way, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/an_hivaids_skeptic_questions_my_honesty_1.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;really, really doesn't like me&lt;/a&gt;) to jump into the fray and provide an "alternate" explanation. Not unexpectedly, her claim is that Christina Maggiore did not die of AIDS. Rather, according to Farber, a combination of &lt;a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/2008/12/30/what-killed-christine-maggiore/" rel="nofollow"&gt;stress and a "radical detoxification" regimen killed Maggiore&lt;/a&gt;. However, even if her account is accurate (a huge "if" given that Maggiore has never been particularly forthcoming with her medical history), then, no matter what killed Maggiore, HIV or quackery, her case stands as a shining example that pseudoscience and antiscience kill.

Because you’re going to get an extra 0.0000031689% of it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, on top of the leap day we had on February 29, there’s a leap &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt; getting added tonight. 2008 is the year that keeps on giving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/judepics/190101132/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/leapsecond_clock2.jpg" alt="Astronomical clock"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have leap &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt; because the length of the Earth’s day isn’t an even fraction of the year, and we add a day in every fours years to help even it out (though in reality &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/02/28/why-we-have-leap-days/"&gt;it’s a &lt;em&gt;LOT&lt;/em&gt; more complicated than that&lt;/a&gt;).  But why do we add a single &lt;strong&gt;second&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, fair warning: this simple question will lead you down a maze of twisty passages all of which look alike. But first off, for those impatient readers, here’s the simple answer: the length of the day based on the Earth’s spin changes, but the length of the day based on atomic clocks doesn’t, so every now and again we have to adjust them to make them match, adding in a second to align them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that’s no fun. Jumping into the gory details; &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; fun. And you know I love this stuff, so let’s take a closer look. A &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/leapsecond_doctorwho2.jpg" alt="Doctor Who schools you on time"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a zillion ways to measure time. In our daily lives we have the day, the year, the second. The first two are based on actual events: the rotation of the Earth, and the time it takes to go around the Sun (and, of course, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/12/31/happy-new-year-arbitrary-orbital-marker/"&gt;the closer you look at them, the more fiercely complicated they get, too&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;second&amp;quot;, though, is arbitrary; it’s a human-designed length of time. We made it up. In general, you can think of a second as being 1/86,400&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of a day. But scientists don’t like to do that; for one thing, it’s not sciencey enough. For another, the length of the day changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[UPDATE: What I wrote below is technically correct, but I decided to be a little more detailed &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/31/followup-leap-seconds/"&gt;in a followup post&lt;/a&gt;. Please read that when you finish this.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Earth were a solid body with nothing nearby, it would merrily spin at the same rate forever. But it’s not alone: the Moon and Sun are breathing down our necks, so to speak. The gravity of these two guys pulls on the Earth, stretching it and messing with its rotation (again, &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/tides.html"&gt;it’s complicated&lt;/a&gt;, but fascinating). If the Earth were a solid sphere, the slowing caused by the Sun and Moon would be constant. However, the Earth is layered in solid and liquid and sorta-kinda-liquid sections (the mantle is more like a thick plastic than a liquid), and these change how the Earth spins. Instead of gradually slowing down, the rate jumps and skips. Even earthquakes can change the Earth’s rotation; the huge seismic event in December 2004 that caused the tsunami in Indonesia &lt;a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/DutchS/PLATETEC/RotationQk2004.HTM"&gt;shortened the length of the Earth’s day by about 3 microseconds&lt;/a&gt;. That ain’t much, sure, but it happened, and was measurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilspics/152032837/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/leapsecond_gears.jpg" alt="gears of a clock"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even weather affects the Earth’s rotation! Obviously, the length of the day is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the best standard of measurement to use for time if you want to be really anal and get out to the tenth decimal place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why scientists decades ago changed the basic unit from the day to the second, and then decided to base the length of the second on something that won’t change over time. What they needed was a cosmic metronome, and light itself is a good one. It’s a wave, so it has a &lt;em&gt;frequency&lt;/em&gt; — how many wavecrests pass through a point in space every second. If you’re on the beach, and a wave crashes ashore twice per minute, then it has a frequency of once every 30 seconds, or 1/30 = 0.0333. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can flip that definition over, and instead of saying the frequency of some wavelength of light is how many crests pass a point in space every second, we say the unit of time called the second is when a given number of wavecrests pass by that point in space. There’s nothing magic here; it’s just a definition. So let’s do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="left"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/leapsecond_doctorwho1.jpg" alt="Doctor Who’s fob watch"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need a really solidly stable wavelength we can measure. It turns out that a cesium atom gives us just that. The outer electron in a normal cesium-133 atom will sometimes spontaneously flip over, in a sense swapping north and south poles. This is called the &lt;em&gt;hyperfine transition&lt;/em&gt;, for those keeping notes at home. When the electron does that, it gives off a very specific wavelength of light (in the microwave region with a wavelength of roughly 3 centimeters). That corresponds to a frequency of 9,192,631,770 wavecrests per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since cesium atom electron spin-flips are so very precise, we can measure them very accurately, and use them as a basis for our clocks  (and when you hear the term &amp;quot;atomic clock&amp;quot;, that’s what it means). All we have to do is invert our measurement, and then say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One standard second is the length of time corresponding to 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted by the hyperfine transition of an unionized cesium atom in the ground state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woohoo! OK, sure, that sounds complicated, but it’s actually very precise and measurable and scientists get all charged up about it. All &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; have to do is nod your head and accept it. The bottom line is, we have a very precise definition of what a second is, and it’s not based on the Earth’s messy spin. This definition was ratified in 1967 during the Thirteenth General Conference on Weights and Measures. Yes, there’s a meeting for that. I can imagine all the scientists and engineers sitting around during talks at that conference constantly checking their watches. That image makes me smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, now we’re finally ready to understand why we have leap seconds! We have the superprecise scientific definition of a second, and we have the sloppy one we use in everyday life based on the Earth’s spin. But the Earth’s spin is changing! On average it’s slowing down, and that difference builds up. [Don’t forget to read &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/31/followup-leap-seconds/"&gt;my followup post&lt;/a&gt;!] Eventually, when the difference between the day measured by the Earth’s rotation and the one based on the cesium atom gets to be more than 0.9 seconds, a leap second is added in to the day to match them up better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tadaaa!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zoutedrop/2317065892/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/leapsecond_clock.jpg" alt="Clock at midnight"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/leapsec.html"&gt;The last time this was done was in December 2005&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s happening tonight. That means that officially, we get the following weird sequence of events: The official clock will be ticking tonight, counting down to the New Year. Just before midnight it will read 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds. But instead of clicking over to 00 hours 00 minutes 00 seconds on January 1, it will first read 11 hours 59 minutes 60 seconds on December 31! Weird. Imagine your bedside alarm clock going from 11:59 to 11:60 for one second before flipping over to 12:00 and you’ll get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the tale of the leap second. Ironically, if you’ve read this far, you’ve blown several minutes of your life, and the extra second tonight won’t make up for it. But now you know why you get that extra second, and you can savor it. Take an extra sip of champagne, or kiss that Significant Other a moment longer, or just take 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a cesium-133’s atom to ponder what 2009 will be like… even if the coming year is a wee bit shorter than this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My, how time flies.&lt;/p&gt;

Jordan, "&lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1231/p06s04-wogn.html"&gt;Corruption in Bulgaria tests EU expansion&lt;/a&gt;", Christian Science Monitor, 12/31/2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As the economy worsened here, so, too, did corruption, says John Heck, who runs an EU-funded, anticorruption project in Sofia. The problems are ingrained deeply into modern Bulgarian society, he says, "Integrity – if you look in the Bulgarian dictionary, you won't find the term."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an alternative version of an old anti-corruption anecdote about how language X has no word for &amp;quot;accountability&amp;quot;, for X = {French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian, Bemba, Chinese, …} — see &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003925.html"&gt;Solving the world's problems with linguistics&lt;/a&gt;", 12/17/2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I don't know any Bulgarian, I disbelieve Mr. Heck on general principles: when someone makes a sociological point by saying that language L has no word for concept C, you'll rarely lose by betting that they're wrong. (And if they say or imply that speakers of language L have no way to express concept C, then you'll almost never never lose by betting against them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for assertions in the other direction, that you can learn something important about society S by observing that they have a word W for the esoteric concept E, you can safely make book against those claims as well. This is somewhat less certain — there are plenty of curious concepts out there, and sometimes one of them is associated with a mono-morphemic word in one language or another. But the level of, well, &lt;em&gt;integrity&lt;/em&gt; among those who invent such claims is on average extremely low, and so the chances are very good that any particular example belongs to the category of assertion to which philosophers assign the technical term "bullshit".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was recently a great example of this in Geoff Pullum's post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=961"&gt;Gaelic as a bonsai word bag (with two missing)&lt;/a&gt;". Allan Brown, in the Times, asserted that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… sgriob is […] the Gaelic word describing the tingle of anticipation felt in the upper lip before drinking whisky. The fact that Gaelic has a six-letter word for this while English has a twelve-word phrase reveals a lot about Gaelic ways and priorities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wanna bet?  In the comments, sh gave the entry in Dwelly [= Edward Dwelly (1911), Faclair Gàidhlig gu Beurla le Dealbhan/The Illustrated [Scottish] Gaelic- English Dictionary (10th ed.), Edinburgh: Birlinn Limited, ISBN 1874744041]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sgrìob, -a, an&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;s.f.&lt;/em&gt; Scratch, track, mark, line. scrape. 2 Furrow, as a plough. 3 Cart-rut. 4 Trip, journey, excursion. 5 Calamity, bereavement. 6. Itching of the lip, superstitiously supposed to portend, a kiss (s.-pòige), or s.-dibhe (&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; s.-drama), a dram. 7 Curry-comb. 8 Stroke of a whip-saw. 9†† Hurt. S. do ’n Ghalltachd, &lt;em&gt;a trip to the Lowlands;&lt;/em&gt; thoir s. mu ’n cuairt, &lt;em&gt;take a turn round, make a circuit;&lt;/em&gt; s. an t-sàibh mhóir, &lt;em&gt;a stroke of the whip-saw;&lt;/em&gt; s.-croinn, &lt;em&gt;the furrow of a plough;&lt;/em&gt; s. bhuntàta, &lt;em&gt;a drill of potatoes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words,  &lt;em&gt;sgrìob drama&lt;/em&gt; means something like "dram-scratch" or "dram-itch",  interpreted as the feeling you have in your lip just before drinking a dram. It's not a six-letter monomorphemic word, it's a two-word phrase, created by combining the word for "scratch" or "itch" with the word for "small draught of liquor", with the sort of particularizing interpretation typical of such phrases.  For a similarly amazing example, consider, oh, say, &lt;em&gt;chair lift&lt;/em&gt;, referring to &amp;quot;a device for transporting people up a mountain slope, usually consisting of seats suspended from a continuously moving overhead cable&amp;quot;. Just think — this perverse language, English, can express in 9 letters a concept that we would otherwise need 20 words to describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently the forces of darkness are mounting an attack, this time on the Christian holiday of New Year's Day, which commemorates and worshipfully celebrates the anniversary of the day on which a Romanian monk miscalculated the year in which our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was born. In addition to the anticalendricals, it seems that the Chinese, Jews, and Muslims are all opting out and deciding to celebrate other days as their new year. More recently the ranks of these heathen have apparently been joined by the ancient Babylonians. Worse still, countless American companies are yielding to the pressure from these groups, and instructing them to wish people "Happy New Years Day" rather than "Happy New Year's Day".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a warm-up. Next we make an assault on that pagan festival of lust, Valentine&amp;#39;s Day, and then comes the big push to reconquer Easter in the name of the ancient fertility goddess. That one will be tricky — they keep moving the date around to confuse us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/it_never_ends.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/499584977" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230741401877"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3573">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3484b2030b93fef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="FREAK est links"/><title type="html">The FREAK-est Links</title><published>2008-12-31T16:18:01Z</published><updated>2008-12-31T16:18:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/lhkF0T_JZxI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/the-freak-est-links-178/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The winter holidays listed by Wikipedia word count.

Myer's poll-crashing proclivities as being childish and pointless. However, so few people seem to agree with my take on it that I'm wondering whether, if I can't beat 'em I should join 'em. So let's try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Obama Transition Team website, Generation Rescue has put up this &lt;a href="http://change.gov/page/content/openforquestions20081229/"&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; (just type in the search term "Generation Rescue" to find the question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey were named 2008 Couple of the Year (www.ageofautism.com) due to their advocacy work for Generation Rescue. Why hasn't the Transistion Team made autism a top priority and sat down with the leaders of this organization?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the tally is 67 for, 17 against the question as a "good question." That's a small enough poll that my influence might actually make a difference. I realize my impact will be blunted by the fact that the Obama website requires registration to vote, but let's see what happens. The worst that happens is that I fall flat on my face and I'll never do this again, which, depending upon your point of view, might be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, crash that poll!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/if_you_cant_beat_em_join_em_crash_this_p.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/499532565" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230741105222"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/ready_for_another_molly.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07ef26bb7a5474a3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Administrative"/><title type="html">Ready for another Molly?</title><published>2008-12-31T16:20:22Z</published><updated>2008-12-31T16:20:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/499564161/ready_for_another_molly.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/ready_for_another_molly.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="Pharyngula : Commenter Awards" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/molly.php"&gt;Molly Award&lt;/a&gt; for the month of November goes to &lt;a href="http://emmetcaulfield.net/"&gt;Emmet Caulfield&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The end of the year always elicits annual reviews of events, of course. They can be boring, funny, awe-inspiring, useless, and LOL-inducing. But it’s not often you get one that’s literally other-worldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s just what Carolyn Porco delivers with her &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/index.php?js=1"&gt;2008 &amp;quot;Captain’s Log&amp;quot; summary&lt;/a&gt; of a year of discovery from the Cassini Saturn probe. Even if you don’t like the usual annual nostalgia, I think this is one you’ll want to look at.

Since I'm not likely to
have time to write while I'm away, I'm taking the opportunity to re-run an old classic series
of posts on numbers, which were first posted in the summer of 2006. These posts are mildly
revised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ω is my own personal favorite transcendental number. Ω isn&amp;#39;t really a specific number, but rather a family of related numbers with bizarre properties. It&amp;#39;s the one real transcendental number that I know of that comes from the theory of computation, that is important, and that expresses meaningful fundamental mathematical properties. It&amp;#39;s also deeply non-computable; meaning that not only is it non-computable, but even computing meta-information about it is non-computable. And yet, it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; computable. It's just all around awfully cool. &lt;/p&gt;

Now, though, there is cause for some jubilation, since a certain &lt;a title="Discworld News December 2008 ｩ PJSM Prints" href="http://www.paulkidby.com/news/index.html"&gt;godless humorist and fantasy author has been awarded a knighthood for his services to literature&lt;/a&gt;.

He's been named by Rebecca Watson (a.k.a. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog"&gt;The Skepchick&lt;/a&gt;) as one of the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4996"&gt;Top 10 Skeptics Who Kicked Ass in 2008&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4996"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/skepchick2008.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm tellin' ya, to be included in a list with luminaries such as &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;Ben Goldacre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=186"&gt;Amanda Peet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.susanjacoby.com/"&gt;Susan Jacoby&lt;/a&gt; (whose book, &lt;em&gt;The Age of American Unreason&lt;/em&gt;, I really really need to get around to reading), &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt;, and fellow ScienceBlogger &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;P.Z. Myers&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, my favorite skeptic on the list this year is Sanal Edamaruku, the Indian skeptic who was threatened with death by a Tantrik's death chants and cheerfully challenged the Tantrik to &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1129"&gt;go ahead and try to kill him&lt;/a&gt;. The only condition was that no physical contact could be made. Then, on national TV he was seen cheerfully smiling as the Tantrik tried over and over and over again to chant him to death with his "magic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca is wrong about one thing though. It's not true that no one has ever seen Orac, not even his wife. Trust me, my wife has seen me (although, unfortunately, of late not as much as we should see each other). Also, a certain super secret cabal of skeptics have actually seen Orac "in the flesh" (or "in the plastic"), so to speak, including fellow members of the ScienceBlogs collective and even her &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/"&gt;Skeptics' Guide to the Universe&lt;/a&gt; co-podcaster &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/"&gt;Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. Amusingly, however, at the time Steve was utterly unaware that it was me and didn't realize it until I told him later in another context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that, perhaps, is a story for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for 2009, here's hoping this skeptic can continue to kick ass in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/im_not_worthy_im_not_worthy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/499452107" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230731775969"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-2806362003268238062">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/026074630a7ce1d3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Readers May Comment Again</title><published>2008-12-31T13:51:00Z</published><updated>2009-01-01T01:19:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/499467290/readers-may-comment-again.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/readers-may-comment-again.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">There were a few posts made during this blackout so comment on them now as you wish.&lt;div&gt;

It&amp;#39;s that time of year again and so we&amp;#39;ve decided to give it another go. Feel free to suggest your own categories and winners…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most clueless US politician talking about climate change (with the exception of Senator Inhofe who'd always win):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sarah Palin: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, we&amp;#39;re the only Arctic state, of course, Alaska. So we feel the impacts more than any other state, up there with the changes in climates. And certainly, it is apparent. We have erosion issues. And we have melting sea ice, of course. [….] You know there are - there are man&amp;#39;s activities that can be contributed to the issues that we&amp;#39;re dealing with now, these impacts. I&amp;#39;m not going to solely blame all of man&amp;#39;s activities on changes in climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most puzzling finding from 2006 that has yet to be convincingly replicated:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/01/scientists-baffled/"&gt;Methane from plants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most reckless extrapolation of short term trends:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Michael "All global warming has been erased" Asher (&lt;a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=10866"&gt;Daily Tech&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This year's most (unsurprisingly) abused study:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,353844,00.html"&gt;Keenlyside&lt;/a&gt; et al. initialised climate forecasts (and no, they didn't take &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=563"&gt;our bet&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climate scientist with biggest disconnect between his peer-reviewed papers and his online discussions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/how-to-cook-a-graph-in-three-easy-lessons/"&gt;Roy Spencer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most worn out contrarian cliche:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/11/25/115222/71"&gt;The "Gore Effect"&lt;/a&gt;. This combines the irrelevant confusion of climate with weather and the slightly manic obsession with Al Gore over the actual science. Do please grow up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most bizarre new contrarian claim:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Global warming is &lt;a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2008/06/arctic_ice_melt_mat_be_due_to.html"&gt;caused by undersea volcanoes&lt;/a&gt; (and pirates!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The S. Fred Singer award for the most dizzying turn-around of a climate pseudo-skeptic:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dennis Avery:  "Global warming is likely to continue" (&lt;a href="http://acuf.org/issues/issue62/060624cul.asp"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;) , to global warming is "unstoppable" (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/11/avery-and-singer-unstoppable-hot-air/"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;),  to "Say Good-Bye To Global Warming And Hello To Global Cooling!" (&lt;a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/mt331/2008/07/rwns_dennis_avery_interview_2.php"&gt;2008&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pottiest peer on the contrarian comedy circuit:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/global_warming/monckton/"&gt;Viscount Monckton of Brenchley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Least unexpected observations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(Joint winners) 2008 near-record minima in Arctic sea ice extent, last decade of record warmth, long term increases in ocean heat content, record increases in CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most consistently wrong media outlet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/the_war_on_science/"&gt;The Australian&lt;/a&gt; (runner-up the UK Daily Telegraph). Both comfortably beating out the perennial favorite, the Wall Street Journal - maybe things have really changed there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Best actual good news:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2008/12/20/the-end-of-hope/"&gt;The grown-ups being back in charge starting January 20&lt;/a&gt; (compare with &lt;a href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20081207_An_Eroding_Mission_at_EPA.html?viewAll=y"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most inaccurate attempted insinuation about RealClimate:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://planetgore.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDdhZTc4OGRiNjIzNjdhYTkwNTdkNWUzZjFmNTkyOTU="&gt;'The Soros-funded Realclimate.org'&lt;/a&gt; Chris Horner &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most revealing insight into some US coal companies and year's best self parody:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/JustOneThing/Story?id=6444773&amp;amp;page=1"&gt;Frosty the Coalman&lt;/a&gt; (video available &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3q6HeImpPs"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most disturbing trend for science journalism:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The axing of dedicated science units at &lt;a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/cnn_cuts_entire_science_tech_t.php"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, the Weather Channel and elsewhere. Can &lt;a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/"&gt;Climate Central&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/"&gt;blogging journalists&lt;/a&gt; take up the slack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year to all of our readers!&lt;/p&gt;

This is now the sad situation of Caroline Kennedy, whose filled pauses seem to be getting more press than any other aspect of her bid for Hillary Clinton's senate seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample of the stories: "&lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5119062/how-many-times-can-caroline-kennedy-say-you-know-in-under-a-minute"&gt;How Many Times Can Caroline Kennedy Say 'You Know' in Under a Minute?&lt;/a&gt;", Gawker, 12/27/2008; "&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2008/12/28/2008-12-28_say_goodnight_caroline_how_jfks_daughter.html"&gt;Say goodnight, Caroline: How JFK's daughter flubbed the audition to become the next Senator Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;", NY Daily News, 12/28/2008; "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jpOBOSwzlJBl7UHFOR0YPOosX_-w"&gt;Caroline Kennedy roasted over lacklustre press debut&lt;/a&gt;" AFP, 12/30/2008; "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jP3zWoI_aIgfVlt-VOyxBrOUyl3AD95DBAAG0"&gt;Kennedy's 'you knows' become political fodder&lt;/a&gt;", AP, 12/31/2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical stories are coming  from right-leaning news outlets like the Daily News — Michael Saul, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/12/29/2008-12-29_caroline_kennedy_no_whiz_with_words-1.html"&gt;Caroline Kennedy no whiz with words&lt;/a&gt;", 12/29/2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Caroline Kennedy, you know, might need, you know, a speech coach, um, if she, you know, wants, um, to be a senator.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Um, you know?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Kennedy, who gave a flurry of media interviews on Friday and Saturday, revealed some cringing verbal tics that showed her inexperience as a speaker, experts told the Daily News.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In a 30-minute session with The News on Saturday, Kennedy punctuated her answers with "you know" more than 200 times. "Um" was fairly constant, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Transcripts of her interviews with other media outlets showed the same problem. She said "you know" at least 130 times to The New York Times and more than 80 times on New York 1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a slightly more sympathetic version of the same stuff is also coming from outlets like the New York Times, which talks about it by talking about others talking about it — Michael Barbaro, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/nyregion/31mayor.html?partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink"&gt;The Mayor, You Know, Says He Can Sympathize&lt;/a&gt;", NYT, 12/30/2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he feels Caroline Kennedy’s linguistic pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In her pursuit of a Senate seat, Ms. Kennedy has raised eyebrows  with her penchant for what are known, informally in language circles,  as filler words.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Ms. Kennedy has liberally sprinkled her interviews with  “you know” and “um,”  as can be  seen in &lt;a title="our transcript" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/nyregion/28kennedytranscript.html"&gt;transcripts posted on newspaper Web sites&lt;/a&gt;. [..]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;“If there is anyone who understands the pain and suffering from having the press criticize how you speak, it is me,” the mayor said during a news conference at City Hall on Tuesday afternoon. “But as I told my oldest daughter when she said, ‘They are laughing at you,’ the only ways I know how to make it better is to go out there and do it every day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that in objective terms, Ms. Kennedy is any more disfluent in unscripted talk than (say) Ron Paul ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=786"&gt;Remnants&lt;/a&gt;", 10/31/2008), John McCain ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=654"&gt;'Babbling points' from all over&lt;/a&gt;", 9/30/2008), or  Bill Clinton ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002668.html"&gt;Trends in presidential disfluency&lt;/a&gt;", 11/26/2005). And I'm pretty sure that she is less disfluent than Senator Ted Kennedy often was. But &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howie_Carr_Show"&gt;Howie Carr's radio show &lt;/a&gt;excoriated him for decades as "the wizard of uhs", without this being picked up by the rest of the media as newsworthy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The show also features other contests in which prizes - usually of low expense - are given out. In the "Celebrity Death Pool," callers choose which celebrity they believe will die next. In the "Wizard of Uhs" segment, Carr plays a clip, usually thirty seconds or so in duration, of the senior Massachusetts Senator, Ted Kennedy. Listeners have to count the number of uhs that Kennedy says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Barack Obama's speech is sometimes liberally sprinkled with uhs and false starts, and his rate of producing such dysfluencies can rival anything that Ms. Kennedy has given the media to talk about. If I were counting,  I'd start with conversational interviews involving difficult questions, like his exchanges  with Rick Warren at the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHfswHtxspc"&gt;Saddleback Forum.&lt;/a&gt; For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RW:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a tough question. What would be, looking over your life — everybody&amp;#39;s got weaknesses, nobody&amp;#39;s perfect — would be the greatest moral failure in your life, and what would be the greatest moral failure of America?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BO:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, i- i- i- in my own life I'd- I'd break it up in stages, when   uh I had a difficult youth.  Uh my father wasn't in the house, uh I've written about this,   uh there-  uh uh you know there were times where  uh I've experimented with drugs, and I drank,   uh yeah in my teenage years, and  wh- what I trace this to is  uh a certain selfishness on my part, I- I was so obsessed  with me, and  you know the- the reasons that I might be dissatisfied, that  I- I- w- I couldn't   focus on other people. And  uh y- you know I think the process for me of growing up was to recognize that it's not about me, it's about&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;RW: &lt;/strong&gt;I like that. I like that. {laughs} [audience applauds]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BO:&lt;/strong&gt; it's about- absolutely, so- so- but- but look, you know, th- the uh wh- when I  uh wh- when I find myself  um taking the wrong step,  I think a lot of the times it's because I'm trying to protect myself, instead of trying to   do God's work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it seems to me that the focus on Ms. Kennedy's filled pauses and run-on sentences is not completely unfair, though it's based on misleading measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, a &amp;quot;you know&amp;quot; is a more disruptive disfluency than an &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot; or a false start, especially in transcripts, where it&amp;#39;s less likely to be edited out, and more likely to confuse readers if it&amp;#39;s left in. But the most important question, in my opinion, is not how many of which filled pauses were produced per unit time, or any other measure of fluency. Rather, the key issue is whether the underlying discourse has a coherent logical or narrative structure, as opposed to presenting a sequence of loose associative connections, or a jumble of talking points.  Coherence is a lot harder to quantify than fluency is — not that we have a useful measure of degree of that! — and  coherence and fluency are not always (or even usually) correlated.  (For some further discussion, see &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=834"&gt;Bebop language&lt;/a&gt;", 11/16/2008; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=848"&gt;Speaking (in)coherently&lt;/a&gt;", 11/20/2008. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama&amp;#39;s answer to Rick Warren&amp;#39;s question seems lucid and to the point, despite the 10 uhs and 20-odd false starts and four you knows and so on. I believe that this is because Obama is  giving a thoughtful and coherent answer, and in that context, his disfluencies at worst seem superficial, and at best give us some additional clues to the way that his thoughts are unfolding. The disfluent presentation also increases our confidence that he&amp;#39;s thinking as he speaks, rather than just reciting an answer learned by rote — although in fact the content is clearly a prepared answer, at least in the sense that it&amp;#39;s material that he&amp;#39;s written about in the past. (The video increases the sense of coherence, because his gestures and facial expressions provide addition punctuation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caroline Kennedy's audio clips give a very different impression, and not (in my opinion) because of the density of disfluencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness to her, we're rarely given the questions that she's answering; and in some cases, as I've documented, the audio clips are spliced together from different contexts. None of us is likely to come out very well in unedited transcripts of out-of-context clips spliced together from fragments of one-on-one interviews conducted in a diner ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=956"&gt;Filled pauses and faked audio&lt;/a&gt;", 12/28/2008). It's likely that Ms. Kennedy would seem more coherent if we could hear (and see!) whole question-and-answer sequences; and it's even possible that lack of context and dishonest editing are almost entirely responsible for the bad impression that she gives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the same, the clips do give the impression of a jumble of talking points, and in that context, her disfluencies come across as a sign of underlying incoherence, rather than an informal punctuation of a basically coherent message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two typical passages. These cover a similar set of ideas and phrase-fragments, which seem to have been prepared in advance to answer some question like why she's putting herself forward, or why the governor should pick her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. From her &lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/12/27/2008-12-27_caroline_kennedy_tells_daily_news_i_woul.html"&gt;interview with the NY Daily News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;um well I think you know this is a special you know unique moment in terms of our- our history and our country, and  you know- and it's in- and um and in my own personal life, um   and I think uh in terms of  you know I've- I've grown up here, I've lived here all my life,   um I love New York, I love the city, you know, this is my home state, and um  you know I think there's an economic crisis going on, there's um   you know people are hurting, they're losing their jobs, they're losing their homes,  and um and you know and I think New York is losing a powerful advocate in Hilary Clinton, and so   um   you know I- I s- I feel like you know this is something that I always   you know thought about  in the past, and you it's maybe it's one day in the distant future something that I might uh be interested in, when my kids are grown, and  uh things like that, and now, you know, it's like well here's an opportunity um I've been involved in the Barack Obama campaign for the last year, I I- helped uh run the vice presidential selection process,   um you know I think that this is a moment where we need people   who ((that)) nobody can sit this one out, we need people to go uh and bring their like experience and talents and resources that they may have,  and you know   Hillary Clinton, you know, is a big loss for our state, so if I could, you know, shine a light on the problems here, and work with others, you know, and ((you know really space in on  goals set while I'm in Washington)),  you know to really deliver for New York, that's you know I thought well I should throw my hat in the ring. And obviously   this is the governor's decision, and  you know this is his process, so   uh there are lots of other people he can choose from,   and so but I felt like you know   you know if I felt like I had something to add, or  some- something to contribute, I should at least step forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. From her &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W85XJADEHxU"&gt;interview with the AP&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;you know I think really  um this is sort of a unique moment  both in our- you know in our country's history  and in- in you know my own life,  and um  you know we are facing you know unbelievable uh challenges, our economy, you know, health care,   uh people are losing their jobs here in New York obviously, um  uh particularly you know   families are hurting, education is tough, and so  um  you know and for me I've grown up here, I've lived here all my life, I love New York,  and um    you know and- and going into politics is something that people have asked me about for ever, even  when I'd first just thought ((of)) it in my own mind, you know I got- you know people come up to me on the street, on the subway, just this morning, walking over here, on the subway,  and um you know they're like you know "go for it", you know "we're rooting for you", somebody dropped off two hundred signs in my husband's office two weeks ago,  um and so you know I felt well  OK I really ought to take this seriously, this is really an incredible opportunity,  and um and you know  there are issues that I really care about that are going to come up now. I- I come into this thinking I'd have to work twice as hard as anybody else, and   this is- nobody's entitled to anything, and certainly not-  certainly not me. And um  there are many qualified people in this, and so  um you know I- I am an unconventional choice, I understand that, I haven't pursued the traditional path, but I think that  um you know in our public life today you know we're starting to see that there are many ways into   to public life and public service, and it's not um as  you know all our institutions are less um  hierarchical than they used to be, and so  you know I think that you know I bring you know   my life experience to this, and  you know that includes um you know  being a mother,  um you know I understand sort of those choices that women make, it includes you know being a lawyer,   I've written seven best-selling books, you know, two on the constitution,   um you know anthologies about American history and values, political courage,  you know, and I've really tried to encourage people to go into public service,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230717675511"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-8754862026794279540">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84121fd31d6dbe56</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quackery" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Sick Sad People" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Rants" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">I Hate Insufferable Pricks</title><published>2008-12-31T08:30:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-31T08:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/12/i-hate-insufferable-pricks.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">This whole "Doctors are bad!" thing has been getting under my skin lately. It seems to crop up fairly reliably in the comments of any skeptical blog post defending scientific, evidence-based medicine and/or calling out quackery. Some shitheaded little prick in the comments will say "But I went to a doctor and he was cold and clinical and he only stayed for a few minutes and he gave me pills and he didn't listen and boo hoo woe is me he's so mean so now I go to a naturopath who is so nice!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First off, I need not say, I think, that one person's experience with one doctor is not in any way indicative of medical professionals across the globe. But that line of reasoning never works, because they've heard from their friend Low-Ball Bill that &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; doctor did something similar, and when Aunt Flossy Mae had ass cancer, the doctors said she probably only had a few months to live but she lived for three more years! Point being, these insufferable assholes will find reasons to reinforce their hatred of doctors and medicine in general, and our cries of "Anecdote!" will always fall on deaf ears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, I'd like to tell them something slightly more pointed: stop whining, you self-obsessed little shits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a fairly experienced doctor-goer myself, I have a few lessons to give these irritating douchenozzles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 1: The world does not revolve around you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter how much you might like to think it does. You are not the center of the universe. You are not inherently more important than any other person. Understand this, and you'll understand why the doctor only has a short amount of time to spend with you. He or she has &lt;i&gt;other patients&lt;/i&gt;. These people take their problems and illnesses just as seriously as do you, and his job is to help them out, too. He can't spend all day with you handing out warm fuzzies because it's the only way to make Johnny P. Thumbsuck feel like he received an adequate level of treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sheer demands on any single medical professional are immense, and no small part of that is that so very many of them have to juggle patient after patient, day after day. It doesn't let up. He can't stay longer with you because other people need him, too. Don't be a fucking shitstick and bitch because he has to give aid to other needy people. You are not a special fucking snowflake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corollary: You are not a special fucking snowflake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just because you &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; like your ailment is strange and different doesn't mean it is. Just because you've never had a pain in that place or that color discharge coming from there doesn't mean nobody has. In fact, given the sheer amount of people that have existed, I'd bet better than even money that &lt;i&gt;lots of people&lt;/i&gt; have had it before. And chances are your doctor has run into them. So you list your symptoms, he nods, he asks you some questions, shines a light in your ear, and then writes you a script and goes to see the next patient. Just because you don't feel loved doesn't mean your problem hasn't been solved. Did it ever occur to you that despite your gut reaction that your problem is &lt;i&gt;sooo&lt;/i&gt; bad that maybe it just &lt;i&gt;is that fucking simple?&lt;/i&gt; Your doctor has seen lots of people and read lots of literature and maybe, just maybe, you were a textbook case of Assenheimer's Syndrome, so he prescribed the appropriate pill and moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just because you think you deserve more attention doesn't mean you need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 2: Your doctor is probably very smart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're talking people that got through eight years of school and at least four of residency before they could even do anything interesting with themselves. You think you're fucking smarter than them? You probably couldn't tell rosacea from ecsema. You don't know gonorrhea from chlamydia. You've had exactly no medical training, and yet you presume place yourself in a position to question without reason the knowledge of your very well-educated doctor? Chances are good that your doctor knows what the fuck he or she is talking about. Chances are good that you don't have a clue. So shut up and take your fucking pills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 3: Your doctor is trying to help you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard to believe, I know. She only went through all that schooling and training I mentioned above, working 60-80 hour weeks just to earn her fucking stethoscope, reading and writing case reports in what spare time she had. That doesn't really show any kind of dedication to the medical profession or anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh wait, it does, and you're a bastard if you think differently. Your doctor probably has his or her job because he or she wants to help people. You, as a member of the set "people," are someone he probably wants to help. Of course, if you go in there thinking "I bet this doctor's just one of those lazy rich assholes who just cares about money," then that's all you'll see. But why would you think that? Seriously, why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 4: You probably don't help the problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow I doubt that all you selfish, arrogant jackholes even talk to your doctors properly. You probably don't talk about all of your apparent or suspected symptoms, and chances are you aren't nearly as thorough as you should be. Well, then, if your problem doesn't gets solved, whose fault is it? The doctor, who treated the problem presented to him, or the patient, who gave the doctor faulty information and then somehow expects a magical cure for the whole ailment?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corollary: You are probably an asshole&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's okay. Most people are. The problem isn't with being an asshole &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;, it's with not recognizing that you are an asshole. Recognizing and coming to grips with your own assholishness is the only way to overcome it when you need to. And there are plenty of situations when you need to; the doctor's office is one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm usually quite an asshole. I'm short and smartassed with most people and I curse loudly and violently around small children without thinking about it or batting an eyelash. But when I get to the doctor's office, &lt;i&gt;I turn it the fuck off&lt;/i&gt;. This person is trying to help me, I am paying them to do so, and so I am not going to risk my quality of care by being a total fucking dick. Not unless I absolutely have to. And if you don't go in guns ablazing, I think you'll find that you rarely have to. Treating a doctor like shit because you think you know better and you assume he's a callous fucktard will not exactly help your case. Talking down to him because you're a conceited, self-obsessed cockknob will also probably make things worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 5: Doctors are people, too&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means simply that, years of training or not, there's a decent chance that if you open hostilities by being an arrogant fecal stain and/or whining about your level of care and/or telling the doctor his business, the doctor will react poorly to you and consequently your quality of care will suffer. People are people, and unless you allow for that fact, you're the fuck-up when something goes wrong. If you expect perfection, you'll always be disappointed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What this also means is that doctors will occasionally screw up. Deal with it. It's part of life. In fact, it's pretty much all of life: &lt;i&gt;shit happens&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And besides that, it seems odd to whine about doctors being less than perfect when you assume from the get-go that they're all money-grubbing, lazy, and ignorant. Compartmentalization, maybe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson 6: Your doctor may not be able to cure you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, unlike the myriad quacks populating the "alternative medicine" movement, should that situation arise, she is ethically obliged to inform you of it. She cannot pretend that a cure exists where one doesn't. She will give it to you straight to the best of her ability. Just because you aren't satisfied doesn't mean your doctor is wrong or incompetent. There are limits to our knowledge. This means there are limits to our ability to cure certain ailments in certain situations. Sometimes there just is no way to fix somebody. It is not "cold" or "callous" to tell you the truth instead of feeding you a comforting lie, or giving you some pure water and saying it holds the memory of a curative substance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*****&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I imagine that my doctor visits are very similar to these people's: I sit down, wait for a few, usually while a nurse takes vitals, and then the doctor comes in, we talk for a while, he examines anything that needs examined, and then he leaves, maybe after giving me a prescription. That's a fairly average visit to the doctor, I imagine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd wager that my visits are qualitatively equivalent to those made by all of these whiny, doctor-hating little bitches. We simply interpret them differently, mostly because I'm not an egotistical anal wart, and they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I accept that, even if I might want five more minutes, there are other people that also need help at least as badly as I do. I don't take the shortness personally. I don't read malice into the doctor's tone of voice. I accept what he tells me. Not necessarily without question, but I'm not a loud, arrogant asswipe about my questions. I recognize that he knows more about medicine than I ever will, and act accordingly. I don't expect hugs and kisses, because those are irrelevant to the fucking equation. I came to get fixed. Either he can or he can't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I go home and take my pills. And you know what? Usually they work. Science is cool like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-8754862026794279540?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230711230626"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/what_does_an_antisemite_look_like.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ece77eaa1aa937cc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Anti-Semitism"/><title type="html">What does an anti-Semite look like...</title><published>2008-12-31T05:15:06Z</published><updated>2008-12-31T05:15:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/499194674/what_does_an_antisemite_look_like.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/what_does_an_antisemite_look_like.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;...who needs a lot of practice still?&lt;/p&gt;

To be understood as relevant and applicable to today necessitates speculation, interpretation and pre-processing for general consumption.  The Bible, as it is written, has become meaningless even though Church leaders try to speculate, interpret and derive meaning from it.  Since Christian leaders don't agree, large portions of the data in the Bible is demonstrably meaningless which is a result of the Information and Data Quality flaw of "Meaningless Representation". &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Article is part seven of the series of articles applying Information and Data Quality (IDQ) Principles to the Bible. The purpose of the series is to show that the Bible is not a reliable or trustworthy source of information about God because it has problems from its origin identified in Information and Data Quality research as causing inaccuracy and unreliability.  Links to the previous articles are listed below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-accurate-is-bible.html"&gt;How Accurate is the Bible?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/applying-data-and-information-quality.html"&gt;Applying Data and Information Quality Principles To The Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/10/applying-idq-principles-of-research-to.html"&gt;Applying IDQ Principles of Research To The Bible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/11/overview-of-idq-deficiencies-which-are.html"&gt;Overview of IDQ Deficiencies Which Are Evident In Scripture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/11/jesus-as-god-from-idq-design.html"&gt;Jesus As God From IDQ Design Deficincies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/11/son-of-man-as-jesus-from-idq.html"&gt;"Son of Man" As Jesus From IDQ Deficiencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brief review of Meaningless Representation(1) follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meaningless representation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the information system contains superfluous information then it can lead to a situation where the Information System does not accurately represent (map back to) a real world state.  For example this can occur by the use of too many descriptive terms, undefined terms or some minor addition to the story intended as an elaboration.  Meaningless states can still represent Real World states properly, however it is not a good design in principle to include meaningless data if for no other reason than users may expend resources and make commitments based on the data only to later discover the data to be meaningless.  For example, the ancient Greek historian Heroditus, while accurate to a large degree, is known to have exaggerated and to have uncritically included information from apparently unreliable sources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 1 illustrates this point by showing two instances of data represented by spheres in the column labeled RW (Real World) and three instances of Data in the D column.  One instance of an information state is not represented by or does not map back to a real world state .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgWn4IJyJI/AAAAAAAAAIc/6zuyCnW9XBI/s1600-h/Proper+Representation.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:158px;height:202px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgWn4IJyJI/AAAAAAAAAIc/6zuyCnW9XBI/s400/Proper+Representation.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgY7GF2p5I/AAAAAAAAAI8/u2d7doipQDU/s1600-h/Meaningless+Representation.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:158px;height:202px" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgY7GF2p5I/AAAAAAAAAI8/u2d7doipQDU/s400/Meaningless+Representation.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operation Deficiencies - Garbling:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meaningless State&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;In human terms, garbling occurs at the point of "consumption" or reading and interpretation.  In Information Systems, it occurs at operation time or when the database is being accessed. Garbling occurs when a Real World state is incorrectly mapped to a wrong state in the Information System.  There are two cases in which this occurs.  If a meaningless state exists, then Real World mapping will be to a meaningless state, or the mapping might be to a meaningful but incorrect information state.  This can occur as a result of inaccurate data entry or omissions of real world states at the creation or origin of the data.  Analogous examples of this type of garbling are legends, folktales and the "Artistic License" of the author or originator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figure 2 illustrates this point by showing two instances of data represented by spheres in the column labeled RW (Real World) and three instances of Data in the D column.  One instance of an information state is not represented by or does not map back to a real world state and a Real World state in incorrectly interpreted as being represented by the superfluous datum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgWn4IJyJI/AAAAAAAAAIc/6zuyCnW9XBI/s1600-h/Proper+Representation.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:158px;height:202px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgWn4IJyJI/AAAAAAAAAIc/6zuyCnW9XBI/s400/Proper+Representation.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgX4AicU5I/AAAAAAAAAIk/VC9XxtAVjVQ/s1600-h/Design.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:158px;height:202px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgX4AicU5I/AAAAAAAAAIk/VC9XxtAVjVQ/s400/Design.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgZUxcoR-I/AAAAAAAAAJE/wQVC7KneowM/s1600-h/Meaningless+State.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="width:158px;height:202px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_PxBx7Ujc1s0/SRgZUxcoR-I/AAAAAAAAAJE/wQVC7KneowM/s400/Meaningless+State.JPG" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GENESIS 1-11 IS REGARDED BY SOME LIBERAL CHRISTIANS AND JEWS AS BEING METAPHORICAL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The terms "Divinely Revealed" and "Divinely Inspired" have no consensus therefore they are meaningless terms with respect to the Bible. Additionally, the Bible contradicts established knowledge about such things as the principles and laws of physics of the Universe and Biology.  If the Bible was divinely revealed then the fact that its metaphorical should have been divinely revealed.  If it was divinely inspired, what does that mean?  There is no consensus so it is meaningless.  Christianity is meaningless because of its ambiguity, sliding windows and moving goalposts of criteria and definitions.  I heartily endorse every Christian to take up their Bible and read it two or three times cover to cover and THINK HARD about what it says.   Use your own brain to figure out what it means.  Don't let anyone do your thinking for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below are a few lines starting at the beginning of the Bible to ask some critical questions and do some thoughtful elaboration.  Please follow along in your Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GENESIS&lt;br&gt;1:1. So where did God come from? If a creation is evidence of a creator, and if everything that exists is created, then if god exists, he is evidence of his creator or he is  "a special case" with no precedent and no extra-biblical evidence or God is a result of apologetic "special pleading" fallacies.&lt;br&gt;1:2. Is similar to pre-existing Egyptian creation myths&lt;br&gt;1:3. Where did the light come from without suns? Some speculative "Pre-light"?&lt;br&gt;1:4. Darkness is the absence of light.  To say that light and dark "can be separated" is meaningless.&lt;br&gt;1:5. This depends on Gen 1:4 being true so its meaningless as well.&lt;br&gt;1:6. The ancients thought there was as much water in the sky as on the earth somehow being prevented from falling.&lt;br&gt;1:7. Depends on Gen. 1:6 being true so its meaningless&lt;br&gt;1:8. Also depends on Gen. 1:6 being true so its meaningless as well.&lt;br&gt;1:9. This is similar to the pre-existing egyption creation myth of Atum creating a hill out of the watery chaos to become the Egyptian city of Heliopolis so he could stand and then have his temple built on it.  The Bible neglects to mention that there is more water than land and there are more than one land mass, which makes it meaningless to "gather the water into one place so that land can appear".  &lt;br&gt;1:10. God named the land and the sea.  But that presumes there was and always has been one original language, when it is known that this cannot be true due to the variety of fundamental differences and mutually exclusive features of the languages of the world.  Communication between members of a species is not unique to Human Beings.  And should there have been an original language that God spoke, then to guarantee its preservation to this day would have been a reasonable and efficient way of guaranteeing the integrity of the Data recorded in the Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As one goes line by line through the Bible elaborating and assessing the information contained within, its mythological character should become undeniable to most people.  If we take the Bible to be 100% true when we start reading it, then as we go through it and find statements that we know to be false and we find statements whose truth depends on false statements, then we should reduce our percentage of belief with every fact shown to be false.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below is an overview of some major but not all inclusive problems with the remaining chapters of Genesis up to chapter eleven.  Why is Genesis important?  Because it lays the foundation for the human necessity of redemption by way of the Human Sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GENESIS 1 continued&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/04/genesis-11-25-is-amalgam-of-near.html"&gt;Genesis 1:1-25 Is An Amalgam of Near Eastern Creation Myths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/05/genesis-126-127-creation-of-humans-in.html"&gt;Genesis 1:26-1:27, Creation of Humans in Near Eastern Myths And The Paleolithic Era&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GENESIS 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADAM AND EVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Story of Adam and Eve is considered a metaphorical story in Liberal Christian Circles.  Several disconfirming facts are listed below with links to my articles elaborating on them.&lt;br&gt;- Being made in the image of God is meaningless, there is no consensus on what "the image of God" is.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/04/disqualifying-adam-and-eve.html"&gt;Disqualifying Adam and Eve&lt;/a&gt;. There is no reason outside of the Bible to accept this story as representing a Real World event.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/07/adam-and-eve-and-problem-of-evil.html"&gt;Adam and Eve and the Problem of Evil&lt;/a&gt;. Shows how the Christian Tenet that humans are "incompetent" nullifies any reliable interpretation of the Bible or any knowledge supposedly gained through flawed Human reasoning.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/05/genesis-128-24a-be-fruitful-and.html"&gt;GENESIS 1:28-2:4a, Be Fruitful And Multiply, Founder Effect and Genetic Diversity&lt;/a&gt;. Shows how lack of Genetic Diversity would prevent the establishment of a Robust and Healthy population.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/05/genesis-24b-20-man-made-from-earth-is.html"&gt;Genesis 2:4b-20: Man Made From Earth Is Folklore, Conflated River Elements and the Myth of Adapa&lt;/a&gt;.

Discusses a correlation between Hebrew and all other Folklore typologies regarding Eve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GENESIS 3: THE FALL OF MAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Killed an animal and made clothes for them, the eyed-needle first showed up about 45,000 years ago with the Cro-Magnons(7).&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/08/adams-sin-was-emergent-behavior.html"&gt;Adams Sin Was An Emergent Behavior&lt;/a&gt;. Shows how the physical makeup of the first Humans guaranteed the emergence of the behavior they subsequently got punished for.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/09/gen-2-3-normal-form-game-matrix-shows_07.html"&gt;Gen. 2-3, Normal-form Game Matrix Shows That God Chose The Worst Outcome&lt;/a&gt;. Shows that the omniscient God Character in the Bible chose the worst possible outcome for his creation guaranteeing all the problems that subsequently occurred.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/08/gen-216-324-adam-and-eve-were-mentally.html"&gt;Gen. 2:16-3:24: Adam and Eve Were Mentally Incompetent&lt;/a&gt;. Shows how Adam and Eve did not have enough life experience to make good decisions.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/08/gen-27-36-god-should-have-known-that.html"&gt;Gen. 2:7-3:6, God Should Have Known That Adam Would Disobey.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/08/gen-26-9-god-ignored-adams-admonishment.html"&gt;Gen. 2:6-9, God Ignored Adams Admonishment Option&lt;/a&gt;. Shows that using effective principles of parenting, Adam and Eve's transgression warranted nurturing correction rather than expulsion and the handicap of being cursed by a God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GEN 4 CAIN AND ABEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Founder effect.  Due to lack of genetic variation, the effect of the small percentage of natural mutations are amplified in a population generally reducing the efficiency of the organism and increasing the probability of birth defects.&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/05/genesis-128-24a-be-fruitful-and.html"&gt;GENESIS 1:28-2:4a, Be Fruitful And Multiply, Founder Effect and Genetic Diversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Where did the other people come from, where they all first and second generation relatives?&lt;br&gt;- 4:17 he built a city and called it Enoch.  People first lived in caves then around 28,000 years ago starting building shelter structures out of Mammoth bone(7). How did they go from cavest to bone structures to cities in one generation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE MARK OF CAIN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The Mark of Cain is meaningless.  There is no clear consensus on what it was.&lt;br&gt;- It was thoughtlessly regard by some as Black Skin, justifying racism.  However all Cains offspring would have been destroyed in the Flood if the Flood had really happened.

Very similar to the Greek Titans.&lt;br&gt;- Similar to Babylonian myths, Enuma Elish&lt;br&gt;* &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuma_Elish"&gt;Wikipedia, Enuma Elish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Mathematically and Logistically, the Ark doesn't add up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GEN 7 THE GREAT FLOOD &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Similar to Babylonian myths, Enuma Elish&lt;br&gt;- Where did all the water come from and go?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The book of Genesis says of the Flood that ‘… all the high hills that were under the whole of heaven were covered…’ Taken literally, this seems to indicate that there were 10,000 to 20,000 feet of water on the surface of the earth, equivalent to more than half a billion cubic miles of liquid! Since, according to biblical accounts, it rained for forty days and forty nights, or for only 960 hours, the rain must have fallen at a rate of at least fifteen feet per hour, certainly enough to sink any aircraft carrier, much less an ark with thousands of animals on board.”&lt;/i&gt; - John Allen Paulos, Innumeracy, (Collins Publishers, 1988), p. 13.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GEN 8 THE FLOOD SUBSIDES &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- God evidently changed his mind and said that he would never do that again even though "every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood".  God cannot logically change his mind if he knows everything from the beginning.  Once he knows the future, the future is set.  If the future changes, then he didn't know it.  If he knew of a finite number of outcomes, he should have know which one would happen, thereby making all other outcomes irrelevant.&lt;br&gt;- The earth would be a big marsh after that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GEN 9 COVENANT OF THE RAINBOW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Founder effect again.&lt;br&gt;- The rainbow is a refraction of light and can be reproduced in the lab.  It would have been present before the flood unless the physics of the world was different prior.  Since God set it up as a "note to self", God cannot be omniscient.&lt;br&gt;- Noah was mad at Ham so he cursed his son Canaan?  All Ham did was tell his brothers that Noah was Naked. Any other interpretation is pure speculation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GEN 10  DESCENDENTS OF NOAH&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Founder effect again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;GEN 11 TOWER OF BABEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- How does an ancient Zuggarat no more than 170 meters tall threaten a god and space travel doesn't?  &lt;br&gt;- There was never a single language. The exact definition of Language differs from one theory to another, but it is evident that other species have forms of communication, therefore, it is likely that communication and language develop within a culture, therefore independent of each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language"&gt;Wikipedia, Origin of Language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;- DNA Damage guarantee humans can't live much more than 120 years.&lt;br&gt;- God didn't know everything because he was evidently surprised by how capable humans were to build the Zuggarat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;MEANINGLESS ITEMS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Bible was Divinely inspired or Divinely revealed, then its truths should be timeless, not just applicable to the the time frame they were written.  Apologists will tell you that the authors were speaking to people of their time, but that excludes any influence that an omniscient being would have had.  In fact, plenty of "truths" originating from the ancients have survived relatively uninterpreted and sound to this day, specifically mathematics.  Likewise, an omniscient being could be expected to do just as well as its human creations in creating and preserving ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New Testament is full of meaningless things.  Here are a few examples.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO CHRISTIANS NEED TO LIVE UNDER OLD TESTAMENT LAW OR NOT?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; It seems clear that Jesus intended Christians to keep the old testament laws without apologetic equivocation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;17 "Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.&lt;br&gt;18"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished.&lt;br&gt;19"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;TURNING THE OTHER CHEEK, ON ITS FACE, IS BAD ADVICE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It enables bad behavior to continue.  The middle ground is the more appropriate where harm is minimized and less harmful behavior is nurtured.  As it is written, it is meaningless without some further interpretation and speculation on the intention behind the speaker, namely God as Jesus.  And who is qualified to interpret the intentions of God?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt; 38 "You have heard that it was said, 'AN EYE FOR AN EYE, AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH.'&lt;br&gt; 39 "But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.&lt;br&gt; 40 "If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.&lt;br&gt; 41 "Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.&lt;br&gt; 42 "Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are Christians saved by Faith, Works or Both?&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Depends on who you talk to.  There is no consensus therefore it is meaningless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;JESUS COMMITS A FALLACY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Whoever is not with me is against me" and "whoever is not against us is for us".  Logically this is mutually exclusive and it is a fallacious reasoning scheme.  If you have three groups of people, committed, rebellious, and ambivalent, then Luke 12:30 would exclude 66% percent while Mark 9:40 would only exclude 33%.  Luke would exclude the Middle while Mark would include them.  What happens to those that don't care one way or the other?  Who knows?  Therefore its meaningless and logically inconsistent coming from the mouth of God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke 12:30 "He who is not with Me is against Me; and he who does not gather with Me scatters."&lt;br&gt;Mark 9:40 "For he who is not against us is for us."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it possible that God revealed his word to Joseph Smith?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, it depends on who you talk to.  There is no logical reason that it could not have happened, especially if it presumed that Gods interaction in peoples lives is ongoing to this day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRAYER IS MEANINGLESS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/03/promise-of-prayer.html"&gt;My article on "The Promise of Prayer"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does one pray?  God should already know what is desired. People should not be able to influence God if he has a plan and already knows everything in advance.  Does he need or want praise?  How does a perfect being need or want anything?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I invite the reader to continue to apply what they already know to elaborating and evaluating the data in the Bible.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;References and Further Reading&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/web.mit.edu/tdqm/www/tdqmpub/WandWangCACMNov96.pdf"&gt;Anchoring Data Quality Dimensions in Ontological Foundations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/05/genesis-128-24a-be-fruitful-and.html"&gt;GENESIS 1:28-2:4a, Be Fruitful And Multiply, Founder Effect and Genetic Diversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_damage_theory_of_aging#Conclusions"&gt;Wikipedia, DNA Damage Theory of Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enuma_Elish"&gt;Wikipedia, Enuma Elish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;5.

&lt;p&gt;What a way to end a great 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Casey Luskin Wrote:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bicycles have two wheels. Unicycles, having only one wheel, are missing an obvious component found on bicycles. Does this imply that you can remove one wheel from a bicycle and it will still function? Of course not. Try removing a wheel from a bike and you’ll quickly see that it requires two wheels to function. The fact that a unicycle lacks certain components of a bicycle does not mean that the bicycle is therefore not irreducibly complex.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took Zimmer a few seconds of searching on Google to find why we should not take Luskin’s ‘arguments’ too seriously (and why Intelligent Design is doomed to remain scientifically vacuous).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy reading &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2008/12/30/oh-no-ive-seen-the-impossible-my-eyes/" rel="external "&gt;yet another reason&lt;/a&gt; why we should all pray for continued employment of Casey Luskin&lt;/p&gt;

Thus ... &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... I am going to open up a personal blog dealing with subjects that are of an elementary nature, or that have more relevancy with understanding or discussing a theologicol (or an atheological!) argument, with the ultimate aim of reaching a higher personal standard of scholarship in my weaker areas when I blog here at DC and present my arguments elsewhere. Such topics may include the nature of God, the Calvinism vs. Arminianism debate from theological perspectives, assessing methodology of history, learning theories about Biblical manuscripts and Early Church beliefs, and so on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will continue to post arguments stemming from my own strengths and research in this past year here at DC; the "learning portion" of my relatively newer interests will be posted at my new blog. Wherever we meet, I am looking forward to discussing and debating all aspects of this universally important topic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Darrin &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://skepticalstudies.blogspot.com/&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Yeah, hard to believe, but true.  Rep. Mark Souder, in a recent &lt;a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081227/NEWS03/812270308/1002/LOCAL"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strike&gt;claimed&lt;/strike&gt; admitted that the highlight of his year was appearing in &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/"&gt;Expelled&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I personally believe that there is no issue more important to our society than intelligent design. I believe that if there wasn&amp;#39;t a purpose in designing you — regardless of who you view the designer as being — then, from my perspective, you can&amp;#39;t be fallen from that design. If you can&amp;#39;t be fallen from that design, there&amp;#39;s no point to evangelism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;First off, this is a critical thinking blog and so I am required by law to tell you this is an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_consequences"&gt;Appeal to Consequences&lt;/a&gt; logical fallacy – the truth (or otherwise) of something does not depend on the consequences of it being true (or not).  If it did, Santa Claus must be real, or Christmas wouldn’t be so much fun.  Of course, you knew that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My legal duties taken care of, it struck me that, fallacious logic or not, Souder unintentionally spoke the truth there.  As he said, “If you can&amp;#39;t be fallen from that design, there&amp;#39;s no point to evangelism.”  Quite true.  Unfortunately, Souder will probably not draw the obvious conclusion from his own words, namely &lt;strong&gt;there&amp;#39;s no point to evangelism&lt;/strong&gt;.  But then, we know from Senator Mark Pryor that you &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/religulous.html"&gt;don’t need to pass an IQ test&lt;/a&gt; to get into congress, so perhaps we shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230676189410"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/30/the-sad-fate-of-the-columbia-crew/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bc80cd92cc47c67a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">The sad fate of the Columbia crew</title><published>2008-12-30T22:26:07Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T22:26:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/30/the-sad-fate-of-the-columbia-crew/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; re-entered Earth’s atmosphere after an otherwise routine mission. When the Shuttle launched a few days earlier, a half-kilo piece of insulating foam on the external fuel tank had broken off during launch and slammed into the port wing at 900 kilometers per hour. No damage was seen on video taken from the ground, and NASA assumed nothing had happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what they couldn’t see was that the piece of foam had punched a hole in the wing itself. When Columbia entered the atmosphere, gas at plasma temperatures entered the hole, ate through the support structure, and the wing essentially broke apart. The Shuttle destabilized and was lost, along with her crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3150922619/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/3150922619_a589571026.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key events have been released by NASA before, &lt;a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/18382143/detail.html"&gt;but a new report has just been released&lt;/a&gt; talking specifically about the loss of the crew themselves. [Note: I couldn’t find anything on the NASA site, so that link goes to WFTV in Orlando that has the report, plus &lt;a href="http://www.wftv.com/video/18381740/index.html"&gt;video taken onboard &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; moments before the Shuttle was lost&lt;/a&gt;.] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive summary gives five main fatal circumstances for the &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; crew:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Depressurization of the crew module at or shortly after orbiter breakup.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew’s suits were not configured for vacuum at the time of the disaster — meaning they were not airtight. Had they been buttoned up, they would not have survived this anyway, but in the future, with more protection in place, a crew might live through such an event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)  &lt;strong&gt;Exposure of unconscious or deceased crew members to a dynamic rotating load environment with a lack of upper body restraint and nonconformal helmets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crew cabin split off from the Orbiter and started to spin. The crew were strapped to their seats, but only with what is essentially a lap belt. Their torsos were whipped around, causing lethal trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Separation of the crew from the crew module and the seat with associated forces, material interactions, and thermal consequences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the crew module broke apart at 200,000 feet and was still moving at hypersonic velocities. Had the crew still been alive when this happened, this event alone would have killed them. Rapid deceleration, seat restraint injuries, pressure, and heat would have all been lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Exposure to near vacuum, aerodynamic accelerations, and cold temperatures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Shuttle broke up, it was so high that even the pressure suits worn by the astronauts would not have protected them from that environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;strong&gt;Ground impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr width="40%"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what to do? In some cases, there are things NASA can do to prevent these five issues in the future. Better suits and more rigid protocols for them, automatic systems that detect an impending disaster and deploy safeguards (parachutes, for example), better dynamic control of the components to prevent them from lethal motion on descent: all of these may save the lives of astronauts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, preventing the entire event from happening in the first place is the best remedy. Better foam application on the external tank would only have prevented this &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; disaster. There are many, many other things that can spell doom for a machine that is by design meant to travel at high velocities in both air and a vacuum.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But better component design and a more thorough process during that design may prevent future astronauts from going through what those seven people did on that winter day in 2003. In many ways, a simple rocket-to-orbit is safer, since it’s simpler to design and the aerodynamic loads on the returning capsule are simpler to engineer for; that’s why Apollo used it, and that’s why Constellation will as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hard as it was to read the parts of the report I did, it must have been incredibly difficult for the NASA investigation team to write it and release. I’m glad they did, and I hope that NASA, and all spaceflight teams across the world, can learn from what happened. Space flight will go on, and there will be more accidents, more deaths. We owe it to the &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; crew, and to those future explorers, to do the utmost best we can to ensure their safety while still learning how to make us a space-faring species.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230675481786"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=5019">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/78aa893e2304c83e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meet-Ups"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Chicago Drinking Skepchickally: Success!

&lt;p&gt;I’ve received a few messages from people apologizing for not making it Saturday. I’ll just say this - I understand that the weather conditions were life threatening. Next time I will not be so forgiving. If you can’t handle Chicago winters, get out of the kitchen! No, really, I’m glad you were smart and warm and safe. You were missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the evening and the amazing &lt;strong&gt;kevinf!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin and his wife, Roxanne, were in town from Gainseville for the holidays and took the time out of their travel plans to come to a bar… and Kevin brought Tang. Seriously. This guy is even cooler than I could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was supposed to be trivia night ended up being not-trivia night.  The group was small, and Mr Elyse and I were tired and wet after our 2 hour trip into the city. I was relieved when everyone was ambivalent about doing an organized contest/game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead we spent the evening talking about skeptical and not-so-skeptical themed hilarity, and even learned a few things.&lt;a title="Someone is going good with this tonight on TwitPic" href="http://twitpic.com/x4zq"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there was still the matter of the bottle o’Buzzed Aldrins to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;img title="multimedia-message63" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/multimedia-message63.jpg" alt="multimedia-message63" width="480" height="640"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end-ish of the evening, we had a skeptical trivia face off. Best of 5. Whoever answered the most questions got the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m suspicious that there may have been some cheating, but I was too many beers into the evening to care much.   The winner was Mr. Jackson Cooper who brought the bottle home to share with his gorgeous wife, and first time Skepchickal Drinker, Medina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the bottle was awarded to the Coopers, Kevin whipped out his Sharpie, Terrell Owens style, and autographed the bottle for them. Because Kevin rocks enough to bring Tang and Sharpies everywhere in case he’s ever involved in a Skepchick-boozey or autographical emergency situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="image_0221" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/image_0221-225x300.jpg" alt="image_0221" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;img title="image_029" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/image_029-225x300.jpg" alt="image_029" width="225" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Jackson and his Buzzed Aldrin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:right"&gt;Kevin, Jackson and Buzzed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I hope everyone had as much fun as I did. You Chicago skeptics are a pretty rad bunch. I’m a pretty lucky girl to be able to hang with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll try trivia night some time when Midwest Winter isn’t trying to kill us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Mike and Medina for defying death and coming out for the first time ever, especially considering the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes from the evening that I can’t cleverly work into this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My initial reaction to seeing Roxanne was &lt;em&gt;oh look, someone brought his trophy wife how cute&lt;/em&gt;. Turns out, Roxanne can seriously hold her own in the smart depart. I have a feeling Dr Kevin, PhD is not lacking intellectual stimulation on the homefront.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I cannot figure out a good way to work in the fact that, in the world of used-panties for sale, “Skidmarks are like snowflakes. No two are alike.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, I am the owner of a bottle corker so that I am able to bottle up cocktails and bring them with me wherever I go. I suppose I could also bottle non-alcoholic beverages, but it seems to be a bit of a waste since it’s totally legal to go almost anywhere with an open bottle of Fresca.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a special method for making Buzzed Aldrins. It’s not just a matter of dropping spoonfuls of Tang into vodka, it’s all about maximizing Tang saturation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Through a telescope, which magnifies images, this becomes even more apparent. Bright, big, nearby galaxies usually float alone in the image, unless accompanied by satellite galaxies (or they live in a cluster).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are exceptions. &lt;a href="http://www.galex.caltech.edu/media/glx2008-02r_img01.html"&gt;Here’s a good one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.galex.caltech.edu/media/glx2008-02r_img01.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3267/3151580094_60a82809d6.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is a visible light image of &lt;a href="http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/mirach.html"&gt;Mirach&lt;/a&gt;, a medium-bright naked-eye star 200 light years away in the constellation of Andromeda. It’s a red giant, a star more massive than the Sun that is nearing the end of its life. It’s hugely over-exposed in the image. Look just above it and to the right: see that smudge? It’s The Ghost of Mirach (technically NGC 404&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#ngc404footnote"&gt;*&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), a galaxy 11 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; light years away overwhelmed by the light of the much closer star. If that galaxy were by itself someplace, it would be a real showpiece, easily seen in small telescopes. As it is, it’s like a firefly sitting on the edge of a spotlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait! That’s visible light, the kind our eye is sensitive to. What if we look at other wavelengths?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In infrared things would be worse; Mirach pours out long wavelength light, being a red giant at all. But what about bluer light? Like ultraviolet, say? Well, that’s the image on the right. Taken by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, or &lt;a href="http://www.galex.caltech.edu/index.html"&gt;Galex&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a UV image of the same region of sky. Mirach is gone! For all its sound and fury in the red, a star like Mirach doesn’t put out much UV, so it essentially vanishes, and we can see past it to the Ghost beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is seen is a bit surprising. The Ghost is a lenticular, a lens-shaped disk galaxy. These are weird galaxies; they are flattened disks like our Milky Way, but generally are devoid of gas, so they don’t have any ongoing star formation in them (like elliptical galaxies). Usually, UV light from a galaxy is a product of gas actively forming stars; massive stars get formed which blast out UV radiation that in turn makes the gas clouds glow. Lenticulars, being gas-poor, shouldn’t be bright in the UV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But look at the Ghost of Mirach! It’s clearly seen putting out UV light, and in fact you can trace a ring pattern too. Rings usually indicate a galaxy got disturbed somehow, usually by the gravity of a nearby galaxy passing it or colliding with it. And, as it happens, &lt;a href="http://www.galex.caltech.edu/newsroom/glx2008-02r.html"&gt;earlier observations of The Ghost using radio telescopes&lt;/a&gt; indicated a ring of hydrogen just where the UV ring is, and the authors of that study think that this galaxy did suffer a collision, nearly a billion years ago. Perhaps back then there was more gas in the galaxy, and the collision triggered a massive wave of star formation that used up almost — but not quite all — of the gas. All that remains now is this semi-stable ring, still making stars, but at much lower rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However it happened, NGC 404 is an object worthy of study, even if sitting in a natural source of light pollution. Astronomers prefer the dark, but sometimes, like anyone else searching for something, we’re forced to look where the light is bright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="ngc404footnote"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr align="left" width="30%"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; You gotta love the punning and appropriate catalog number for this galaxy. NGC &lt;em&gt;404&lt;/em&gt;, for a galaxy that is hard to see and therefore usually &lt;em&gt;not found? &lt;/em&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230667692522"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3603">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/84f5b28ecd6391d2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="gifts"/><category term="holidays"/><category term="internet madness"/><category term="Justin Wolfers"/><category term="Media"/><title type="html">Puzzling Over the Invisible Economy</title><published>2008-12-30T19:41:54Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T19:41:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/HjnXzSD8MjI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/puzzling-over-the-invisible-economy/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Last week I did something that felt very 1990's: I purchased a compact disc.

Seems the undiscerning shopper will often fork over his or her hard-earned money for any steaming pile of crap if it’s wrapped in a colorful wrapper or sealed in a fancy box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, our old friends, the creationists (particularly the Discovery Institute), apparently keep a team of marketing gurus on the payroll these days; the idea being that packaging will help sell their particular steaming pile as science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pre-Marketing Department days of creationism, the product was bare. It was fully exposed. It was unwrapped, and easily seen as the steaming pile it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon, creationists and the ignoranti began branding the product they wanted placed on the &lt;strong&gt;Science &lt;/strong&gt;shelf next to Evolution and Abiogenesis as “Creation Science”. And lo, the undiscerning shopper was impressed. The packaging was rudimentary yet engaging, even if the product itself still steamed mightily and attracted big, green-headed flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a group of consumer advocates that we’ll call real scientists unwrapped the product in court, exposing Creation Science as no science at all, and things were good again for the consumer. The undiscerning shopper was safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after regrouping, and after an intense marketing brainstorm, the creationists struck again. This time they marketed their supposed science product as “Intelligent Design”. And the undiscerning shopper was blown away. The packaging was mesmerizing. It had the word “intelligent” right in the name, so it just had to be good, even though the product still fiercely steamed and the “intelligence” was difficult to scrape off your shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, the consumer advocates, the real scientists, stepped in and showed in court that Intelligent Design was not very intelligent, and that it absolutely did not belong on the same shelf as any real science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the world seemed safe for the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the creationist marketeers were undaunted, and they soon decided to implement a new strategy. They felt a celebrity spokesperson with some slick new rhetoric might be able to distract shoppers from all the pesky facts and evidence that make things like evolutionary biology real science. And fortunately for them, Ben Stein was available and willing to take the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Ben Stein would get word to the consumers via a hastily produced theatrical infomercial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is, Ben Stein is a C-list celebrity at best, and his slick new rhetoric had everyone asking, “Ben, are you bloody stupid or something?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, in the infomercial, the sales pitch was all dressed up as a plea for “academic freedom”; the premise being that mainstream science is stonewalling any dissenting opinions about the origins of life and the development of species. According to Stein-ists, established science is simply not allowing fresh voices to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, perhaps even the undiscerning shopper, with his or her limited knowledge of how science works, knows that science is not a democracy. We can’t change the law of gravitation because there are those who espouse the existence of underground earth gods with suckers instead of objects with mass bending space as the cause of gravity. It would be a very bad idea to stop using medicines when we are ill because some people favor bad spirits inside the body instead of germ theory as an explanation for why we get sick. And we should not stop using the brakes on our cars because some people believe the hand of god can stop us from slamming into the side of a mountain. Science doesn’t care who favors what. It is not affected in the least by popular explanations for things. It only concerns itself with what the evidence suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is, not everyone can grasp this simple notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same Old Stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many undiscerning shoppers are still endorsing Ben Stein’s fabricated and defunked marketing smoke screen. Even with the colossal failure of his infomercial, there are those perpetuating the “war for academic freedom”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our old friends at the Discovery Institute are calling for an &lt;a href="http://www.academicfreedomday.com/about.php"&gt;Academic Freedom Day&lt;/a&gt;. They are asking students everywhere to to use Charles Darwin’s birthday (Feb. 12) to speak out against censorship and stand up for free speech by defending the right to debate the evidence for and against evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is dangerous, because there are a lot of undiscerning shoppers out there to whom this approach seems reasonable. They may not be able to perceive this bit of misdirection from the creationists. Free speech, no censorship, and the right to debate are important endeavors. No one will argue otherwise. But undiscerning shoppers may not understand that free speech isn’t the same beast in relation to science as is it in relation to our inalienable rights. They may not understand that there is no evidence against evolution, only minor gaps here and there in very specific areas that in no way weaken the overall concept. Yet the packaging on this steaming pile would make it seem as though academic freedom is in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, of course we should strive for academic freedom. There should never, under any circumstances, be a shortage of new ideas being introduced. In the humanities, in social studies, in the arts, and in other subjective areas, academic freedom is supremely valuable. New ideas and new ways of thinking are how we continue to advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember, in science, new ideas are only as valuable as the evidence that supports them. If there is no evidence to support them, &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; ideas —whether new or centuries old — should be discarded. And if you do not discard unsupported ideas for stronger, more probable solutions, you are no longer doing science. You are no longer doing science, and you are misrepresenting academic freedom by claiming you’re being denied it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaging superstitious thinking in a shiny academic freedom wrapper to have it recognized in a science classroom is dishonest. It distorts what academic freedom actually is. It sells the strength of the scientific method short. And it re-enforces the fact that your pile of nonsense is steaming and should be washed into the soil with all the other bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on Darwin’s birthday, take some time to explain to an undiscerning shopper what academic freedom really is. Or just sit in the corner blinking, if that’s your preference. Whatever the case, be sure not to support the Discovery Institutes’ marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230662505965"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3591">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/502218d47034743c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="money"/><title type="html">Is This Where the $700 Billion Is Going?</title><published>2008-12-30T18:11:44Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T18:11:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/IJFWdmgo6Lc/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/is-this-where-the-700-billion-is-going/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">There was a lot of noise last week about how the banks who've been drawing down the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program fund can't account for how the money is being spent.

I agree with her picks in general, though I would’ve put Jenny McCarthy as #1 (if someone posts a Top Ten list, you have to say how you would’ve done it differently; it’s a law), or at least tied with Ben Stein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counterbalance that, she just posted her &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4996"&gt;Top Ten Skeptics Who Kicked Ass in 2008&lt;/a&gt;. Again, in the same vein, I would’ve put Amanda Peet higher, since what she did was actually a potential speedbump for her career and therefore pretty brave. As well as critically needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it seems clear that Rebecca should’ve swapped Ms. Peet’s position with PZ’s. What was she thinking? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, her putting PZ and moi in a tie was probably the most politically expedient thing to do. On the other hand, a blog war in the comments of that post would increase her traffic considerably, though, of course, dropping the signal-to-noise to essentially zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also (and I’m not being falsely modest, never fear that) would’ve put Ben Goldacre and Simon Singh higher than me; they went out and took a lot of heat for attacking pseudoscientific garbage in 2008. I had a good year personally, but these guys had a great year for being on the front lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all in all it was a good list, and it gives you a chance to keep your eyes on a few folks who, no doubt, will continue to fight the good fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another thing I like about year-end Top Ten lists: they make me think of the upcoming year, and what needs to get done. 2009 will be a year, like every single one before it, full of antiscientific nonsense. Whose butt will &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; kick in the upcoming 365 days?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230660269367"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2008://2.4088">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f6fffae90f96bb18</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Evolution of Creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Medicine and Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">The January Issue of Scientific American</title><published>2008-12-30T17:43:30Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T17:43:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/the-january-iss.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/sciammag/" rel="external "&gt;It’s about evolution&lt;/a&gt;.*&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title  of the full issue is “The Evolution of Evolution.”  I haven’t read very much yet, but some of the articles that caught my eye are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testing Natural Selection with Genetics,” by H. Allen Orr, an appraisal of natural selection as a major cause of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Latest Face of Evolution in the Classroom,” by Glenn Branch and Eugenie C. Scott, a description of how creationist strategies have evolved as the environment changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Evolution of Hiccups and Hernias,” by Neil Shubin, a depressing look at what kludges we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Evolution of the Mind: 4 Fallacies of Psychology,” by David J. Buller, a skeptical examination of “pop” evolutionary psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Putting Evolution to Work in the Everyday World,” by David P. Mindell, a description of how evolutionary principles are used in, for example, medicine and disease control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*I was going to leave it at that (and apologize to Woody Allen).

The simple answer is, “I don’t know; I haven’t heard them.”  That puts me in the same predicament with his lawyer, Ed Gensen, who faces the problem of having to defend the governor on charges that, so far at least, have not been accompanied with the hard evidence allegedly on the tapes. But hey, that’s how the system usually works. Prosecutors wait as long as possible before revealing their best evidence. Among other things, this helps to delay the defense from preparing as quickly as it could. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all we know at this time, the tapes may contain very damaging evidence that the prosecutor has not yet chosen to reveal. On the other hand, the tapes might be like those in many other cases I’ve worked on in the past — they just look bad. For example, we’re told that they are full of foul language. That’s not enough to convict the governor of a crime but it certainly helps build the impression that something much worse is there. The appearance of guilt goes a long way toward convincing the jury (or the public, for that matter) that what they eventually will hear is worse than the actual words on the tapes may reveal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, people indicted in cases where there are tape recordings start with two strikes against them: (1) they are indicted, therefore they are thought to be guilty; (2) there are those dreaded tape recordings and many people feel that the government wouldn’t indict unless the tapes showed guilt. In the Blagojevich case, the prosecution is also aided greatly by the cocky, gangster-like persona that the governor exudes. It’s not easy to like him or to believe him. And then there is the long history of crime among Illinois politicians. You see where this is going? Well-placed affect gives his lawyer a steep hill to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what lawyer Gensen has in mind as he prepares his defense plans. But I have worked with him several times in the past and I know that he’s quite good at using the government’s tape-recorded evidence to cause it to backfire on them. Sometimes this can be done even when you begin with two (or more) strikes against you. Often it involves asking several questions that linguists commonly ask in such cases, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Are the potentially damaging speech acts of promising, offering, denying, agreeing, etc. even on the tapes? If so, are they felicitous and explicit or are they implied or inferred? And were they made by the target or by other speakers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Does the context of the alleged inculpatory language indicate that the topic was about something else or something more benign and is not explicitly relevant to the charges?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Do the taped passages selected by the prosecution from the hours and hours of conversation accurately represent the charges against the governor? Do the “snippets” (as Gensen calls them) selectively omit parts in which you can hear exculpatory statements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Are feedback markers, like “uh-huh” and “okay” treated as agreements rather than as indicators that the speaker is simply uttering noises that tell the speaker to keep talking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• How accurate are the transcripts? The jury (or the legislature during an impeachment process) will probably be given transcripts of the tape recordings. They are likely to rely on the transcripts rather than the tapes. It takes careful listening to determine crucial differences such as the ones between positive “would” and negative “wouldn’t.” And does the transcript indicate clearly who was present in the conversations and whether the listeners were close enough to the speakers to be likely to have heard what was said? Does it delete parts of the conversations that do not show what the prosecution wants it to show?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• What is the contextual meaning of expressions cited in the criminal complaint, such as “something tangible,” “a valuable thing,” “anything of value,” “golden,” “negotiation,” and “for free”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Have the tapes been altered in any way? This is a matter for an acoustic engineer to determine, but once in a while there is reason to suspect that convenient alterations were made. And are the copies of the evidence tapes that are given to the defense as clear and accurate as the original copy used by the prosecutor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am by no means trying to suggest that the prosecution is guilty of any of the above things or that the governor is innocent.  It may turn out that he is as guilty as the public has been led to believe by the information so far made available.  But tape cases are different from other types of criminal cases. Good defense lawyers are likely to make their own intelligence analysis that differs from the prosecution’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll have to wait and see how Gensen handles this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230659483694"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/16ee799e724ac6af</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">HIV/AIDS denialist Christine Maggiore is dead</title><published>2008-12-30T17:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T17:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/498773415/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Longtime readers of this blog may remember the case of Eliza Jane Scovill. For newbies and those who might not remember, I've copiously linked to posts written by me and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To boil it all down, three years ago a child named Eliza Jane Scovill (often called EJ) &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/09/another-tragically-unnecessary-death.html"&gt;died tragically three years ago&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/12/eliza-jane-scovill-case-on-primetime.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pneumocystis carinii&lt;/em&gt; pneumonia and HIV-associated encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt;. The reason is that her mother, Christine Maggiore, was a prominent HIV/AIDS denialist, who, after having been found to be HIV positive back in the early 1990s fell under the sway of Peter Duesberg and came to believe that HIV does not cause AIDS and that therefore she did not need to take antiretroviral drugs. She even went so far as to form an HIV/AIDS denialist/activist group known as &lt;a href="http://www.aliveandwell.org" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alive &amp;amp; Well AIDS Alternatives&lt;/a&gt;. Even worse, she imposed her pseudoscience on her child EJ. Not only did she &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/09/this-is-what-im-talking-about.html"&gt;refuse to take antiretrovirals&lt;/a&gt; during her pregnancy to lower the risk of maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, but she refused to have EJ tested for HIV and insisted on breastfeeding her, even though breastfeeding can transmit the virus from mother to child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After EJ's death, the HIV/AIDS denialist cranks, aided and abetted by their &lt;a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/posts/1132416234.shtml" rel="nofollow"&gt;allies in the blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;, tried very, very hard to claim that her death was not due to HIV. One in particular, a toxicologist named &lt;a href="http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/books/abbtoxic.htm"&gt;Dr. Mohammed Al-Bayati&lt;/a&gt;, read the autopsy report and tried to blame EJ's death on a reaction to antibiotics and a childhood viral illness, a claim that had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/an_hivaids_skeptic_questions_my_honesty_1.php"&gt;no reasonable basis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/12/more_rebuttals_of_hivaids_skeptics_1.php"&gt;science or medicine&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of my efforts to rebut Dr. Al-Bayati, a representative of Christine Maggiore even tried to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/just_how_stupid_do_they_think_i_am.php"&gt;suck me into a pseudodebate&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of the most bizarre incidents in the history of this blog. Even now I scratch my head when I think about it, wondering just what the heck the HIV/AIDS denialists were thinking when they tried to play me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, now it appears that Maggiore's belief that HIV doesn't cause AIDS might have caught up with her. I say "might have" because we do not know. The one thing we do know is that she has &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-christine-maggiore30-2008dec30,0,7407966.story"&gt;died of pneumonia at the age of 52&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/hivaids_denialist_christine_maggiore_die.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/498773415" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230655770538"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=405">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/803f91694537d1f1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Top 10 Skeptics Who Kicked Ass in 2008</title><published>2008-12-30T15:59:57Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T15:59:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=405" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;x-posted from &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4996"&gt;Skepchick&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As when I was compiling the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4813"&gt;top 10 jackasses of 2008&lt;/a&gt;, I had a really tough time choosing who did the most for skepticism this year. So, I threw the question to my &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/RebeccaWatson"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; followers. This is called “crowdsourcing,” which is like journalism for lazy people. The sad thing is that not a single person nominated a single woman, with the exception of Elyse giving the nod to the very deserving A.Real.Girl. For this list, I’ve exempted the always-awesome Skepchicks since I’m a little biased and so they’d overwhelm the list (I’ve also exempted my cohosts of &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide&lt;/a&gt;, who are also awesome and deserve non-biased accolades). So, I’ve added a few women I thought deserved special mention. There are many more, like &lt;a href="http://www.twis.org/"&gt;Dr. Kiki Sanford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pandagon.net"&gt;Amanda Marcotte&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.secular.org/bios/Lori_Lipman_Brown.html"&gt;Lori Lipman Brown&lt;/a&gt;. I hope when I ask again next year, they come to your collective brains as easily as the men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other runners-up who were nominated via Twitter and Facebook: Brian Dunning for doing Skeptoid and The Skeptologists, &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk"&gt;Sense About Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for their wonderful report on Celebs and Pseudoscience, Mark Crislip of &lt;a href="http://www.quackcast.com/"&gt;Quackcast&lt;/a&gt;,  Barack Obama of the 2008 US Presidential Elections for a thus-far mostly-promising commitment to science, and Jan Meshon of &lt;a href="http://www.Freethoughtaction.org"&gt;FreethoughtAction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of the Top 10, along with some comments from Twitter (and Facebook, connected to my Twitter account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Amanda Peet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/8740/cookiemagazineaugust20cp7.jpg" alt="Amanda Peet"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I can hear you bitching already. “But she’s just an actress!” “She has no scientific training!” “Where’s her blog?” Well, guess what? That’s what makes her awesome. Like it or not, actors have the attention of the world on absolutely any subject they’d like to discuss, which is why a coconut-skull like Jenny McCarthy can convince so many otherwise rational people to put their (and other parents’) children at risk by not having them vaccinated. Amanda Peet actually had the ovaries to step up and declare that she had her daughter vaccinated, that the science supports the safety of vaccinations, and that further, as an &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/Story?id=5483159"&gt;actress she has no special knowledge or authority that should convince anyone to listen to her opinions&lt;/a&gt;. How often does anyone admit something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as ignorant celebs can make the world worse, well-informed and equally-outspoken celebs can make the world better. Let’s hope for more people like Amanda Peet in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Ben Goldacre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Ben Goldacre" src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/3432/bensmallzh6.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="211"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Goldacre  of &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Bad Science&lt;/a&gt; had a banner year, most notably taking down Matthias Rath, #6 on our &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4813"&gt;Top 10 Jackasses of 2008&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ll recall, Rath is the bastard who sold vitamins to cure AIDs patients in Africa, and who then sued Ben and The Guardian for pointing the fact out. Neither Ben nor The Guardian backed down, and they won their case. In addition, Ben &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/12/the-year-in-bad-science-2/"&gt;did a lot of other stuff this year&lt;/a&gt;, too, keeping a watchful eye on UK scam artists and pushers of bad science. He’s tenacious, vigilant, funny, and pretty damned cute, which doesn’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*UPDATE* I can’t believe I forgot to mention that Ben also had an ass-kicking, best-selling book debut this year, appropriately titled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/0007240198/?tag=bs0b-21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Go buy it, and enjoy seeing the media’s treatment of science and medicine completely eviscerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Thunderf00t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vault101Dweller&lt;/strong&gt;: […] Thunderf00t for lack of a better term owning VFX in that DMCA debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I documented &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Thunderf00t"&gt;Thunderf00t&lt;/a&gt;’s epic takedown of VenomFangX &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3477"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so go read that if you need to catch up. As wonderful as that epic win was, it was merely the icing on the delicious cake of scientific knowledge that Thunderf00t has been baking for a long time now (I’m going to drop that metaphor now, thanks). His &lt;em&gt;Why Do People Laugh at Creationists&lt;/em&gt; series, going since 2007, is a concise, easy-to-understand, and entertaining explanation that will arm anyone with the knowledge they need to address the most common creationist claims. Go to his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Thunderf00t"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;, where he’s collected them all in a playlist that lets you play multiple hours of pwnage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Orac&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1365/6923434979f533f29fid4.jpg" alt="Orac?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wackyvorlon&lt;/strong&gt;: Orac has my vote. He’s been on the front lines fighting the anti-vaccinationists for years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orac’s been fighting pseudoscience online since well before I knew what a blog was. As a self-proclaimed egotistical surgeon/scientist (the self-proclaimed was for the adjective, not the nouns), he uses logic, reason, and good old fashioned science to dissect the claims of anti-vaccinationists like Jenny McCarthy (#3 on our list of Jackasses) and creationists like Michael Egnor. Orac has inspired countless other bloggers to tackle medical quackery, plus he supports all other areas of skepticism by running the bi-monthly Skeptics’ Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has ever seen Orac (not even his wife), but apparently he’s some kind of . . . bottle of glue? Named EneMan? I’m not sure. Apparently that’s his mascot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Susan Jacoby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/8223/fepr08030510qabz6.jpg" alt="Susan Jacoby"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you read &lt;em&gt;The Age of American Unreason&lt;/em&gt;, like me, you probably spent the following few weeks cowering under your bed, weeping quietly for humanity. &lt;a href="http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/3683/2008031012kw9.jpg"&gt;Susan Jacoby&lt;/a&gt;’s scholarly, expansive tome plunges through history, sorting out the bullshit from the truth, and showing how over time we’ve come to abandon logic, reason, and intellectual rigor in favor of the irrational and brainless. If you want to know why our Top 10 Jackasses were able to con so many people, look no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually disagreed with her on some points – particularly, her bashing of the Internet – but was always impressed with her ability to back up her assertions and make me think about my own assumptions. While the book isn’t the most optimistic thing I read this year, I still found it to be inspiring. By exhaustively detailing the things that were right in the past and the causes of why things have gone wrong, we can focus more on correcting ourselves to make way for a better, less credulous future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Simon Singh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Simon Singh" src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/7341/682cpj1.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="263"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reed Esau&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): Simon Singh, for not taking the easy way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe Reed was referring to &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;’s ongoing legal battle with a group of angry chiropractors (British Chiropractic Association) who are suing him over his less-than-complimentary essays on their “complementary” services. This may all sound familiar to regular readers, because I wrote about it &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=2200"&gt;back in August&lt;/a&gt;. The suit is still going on today, as Simon and The Guardian (who may deserve an award of their own for also sticking up for Ben Goldacre, above) force the BCA to produce evidence proving that what Simon wrote was untrue. That evidence has yet to be found, strongly suggesting that Simon was correct: chiropractors are promising miracle cures for diseases they cannot actually cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the lawsuit, this is the year Simon came out with the excellent book &lt;em&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/em&gt;, in which he and Edzard Ernst lay waste to countless alternative medicine quack treatments. You should buy it, and you should buy another one for the person in your life who says, “Well there must be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to it, since the Chinese have been using it for 6 billion years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Sanal Edamaruku&lt;a href="http://www.rationalistinternational.net/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/3683/2008031012kw9.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda Rose&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): Oh I vote for Sanal Edamaruku too. http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/25/skeptic-giggles-on-i.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanal is the Indian rationalist &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1129"&gt;who was threatened with death by a “powerful” tantrik’s death chants&lt;/a&gt;. On live TV, Sanal laughed as the Tantrik danced around him while calling upon the gods to strike him dead, for two full hours. He captured the attention of millions who lived in fear of such superstitions, and unflinchingly proved to them that it was all nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incredible popularity of the stunt brought Sanal’s groups the &lt;a href="http://indianrationalists.blogspot.com/"&gt;Indian Rationalist Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rationalistinternational.net"&gt;Rationalist International&lt;/a&gt; into the limelight, showing the entire world that English-speaking countries don’t have the monopoly on skeptical heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. (TIE) Phil Plait&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Phil Plait" src="http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/7703/skepdudecalendarbigtl3.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="249"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cabose&lt;/strong&gt;: Phil Plait. Reason: Death from the Skies. I think he wins now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eafarris&lt;/strong&gt;: Gotta be @badastronomer. Witness http://zi.ma/4a01 and http://zi.ma/35bd55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trianglman&lt;/strong&gt;: @badastronomer ’s Death from the Skies kicks a lot of ass (at least the first part that I’ve read so far)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JHVanOphem&lt;/strong&gt;: My vote is for @badastronomer His endless energy led him to the JREF Presidency and the future looks bright indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, friend-of-Skepchick Phil Plait has to make the list! The newly chosen president of the James Randi Education Foundation, author of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death From the Skies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and longtime skeptic had an amazing year. He’s now reaching more people than ever with his inspiring awe for science and his canny ability to call out bullshit when he sees it. Plus, he’s a complete and total nerd who gushes about &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, and other lovably dorky topics. And did I mention he posed in the Skepdude calendar? Is it any wonder we all love him? He got tons of votes in the Twitter poll – in fact, just about exactly as many as . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. (TIE) PZ Myers&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="PZ Myers" src="http://img139.imageshack.us/img139/8040/moirt4.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="266"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoffeeJedi&lt;/strong&gt;: PZ Meyers for Crackergate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teambanzai&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m going with PZ Myers. Reason being how he handled the Exposed mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Rosch&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): . . . the winner I think is PZ, because he was expelled from Expelled, broke into the Expelled tele-conference to plug expelledexposed.com, Crackergate (the story that wouldn’t die), and now w/ him getting credit for thwarting the alliance btw. the Cincinnati Zoo &amp;amp; the Creation Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s controversial, political, unapologetic, skeptical, and hilarious – he’s our own PZ Myers of the popular blog &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;. As his Twitter nominations suggest, he won this spot on the list by kicking the asses of two of our top 10 jackasses: Ben Stein and Bill Donohue. For Ben, PZ caused an uproar when he was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/expelled.php"&gt;expelled from Expelled&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1190"&gt;burst into a faux-press conference&lt;/a&gt;, almost literally stealing the show. Recently, also as mentioned by Michael on Facebook, PZ even managed to sink a deal between the Cincinnati Zoo and the Creation Museum, earning him even more ire from the crazies. I’ve yet to see him back down from any challenge, and I fully expect him to continue kicking ass well into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And look at how he snuggles that squid. Awwwww.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Marcus Seda’s Brother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Beaker" src="http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/1955/lylebeakerkz1.gif" alt="" width="240" height="320"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcus Seda&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): My brother the science teacher. He shows movies like “the Core” and “the Day After Tomorrow” to point out the bad science theirin. He also uses the Onion to show how not everything you read is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of you but Marcus (and possibly his brother) are probably wondering, “WTF?” I assure you, this isn’t a Time-Person-of-the-Year-like cop-out, since I’m not naming YOU the number one skeptic. Instead, I’m giving the honor to the teachers and parents who are reaching kids and instilling in them a love of science and the ability to tell fantasy from reality. I wanted to populate this list with people who had really accomplished something this year – something tangible – and hey, who have accomplished more than those people with the direct connection to our future society’s ability to reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, help me out here. In the comments, I’d like for you to nominate a teacher, parent, or other skeptic who has directly affected someone’s life for the better this year. As I asked the Twitter crowd: please show your work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca Watson</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230655565788"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/it_must_be_pick_on_indiana_day.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1bef9ffa38fb08b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">It must be "Pick on Indiana Day"</title><published>2008-12-30T16:08:39Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T16:08:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/498714128/it_must_be_pick_on_indiana_day.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/it_must_be_pick_on_indiana_day.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;No hard feelings, people, I lived there for a while…but Hoosiers sure can pick &amp;#39;em. I was there when Dan Quayle was the hero of the hour, and I had no idea they could sink even lower. Here he is, though: Congressman Mark Souder, who claims that the &lt;a href="http://freethoughtfortwayne.org/2008/12/27/congressman-mark-souder-says-his-highlight-of-the-year-was-being-on-ben-steins-expelled/"&gt;highlight of his year&lt;/a&gt; was appearing in &lt;a href="http://expelledexposed.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Expelled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Seriously, and with fervor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally believe that there is no issue more important to our society than intelligent design. I believe that if there wasn&amp;#39;t a purpose in designing you — regardless of who you view the designer as being — then, from my perspective, you can&amp;#39;t be fallen from that design. If you can&amp;#39;t be fallen from that design, there&amp;#39;s no point to evangelism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there you go. The economy is a mess, we're in a war, and the most important thing in the world to an Indiana congressman is proselytizing for Jesus in a crappy Intelligent Design creationism movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, how that occurred — whether you believe in the young earth theory, gradual evolution, or whatever — is disputed. Those become religious. But whether there was a fundamental designer who developed a complex DNA molecular structure is critical. Since I view that as the most important thing in the world, yes, being in a movie that advanced that cause was the personal highlight of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey, I was in that movie, too! I still haven't seen it, though. Maybe Souder's performance would turn me into a born-again Christian if I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah…I predict that he was a corn-poney dope in the movie, just like he is in the interview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/it_must_be_pick_on_indiana_day.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/498714128" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230655090235"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3597">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66e8e6f436a8769f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="crime"/><category term="drugs"/><category term="James Alan Fox"/><title type="html">The Latest on Homicide Rates</title><published>2008-12-30T16:27:34Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T16:27:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/oSBY1jze9qk/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/the-latest-on-homicide-rates/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Nothing grabs headlines like dire warnings about homicide trends.

So, I threw the question to my &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/RebeccaWatson"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; followers. This is called “crowdsourcing,” which is like journalism for lazy people. The sad thing is that not a single person nominated a single woman, with the exception of Elyse giving the nod to the very deserving A.Real.Girl. &lt;img title="kickassbadge_plural" src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/kickassbadge_plural.jpg" alt="kickassbadge_plural" width="170" height="200"&gt;For this list, I’ve exempted the always-awesome Skepchicks since I’m a little biased and so they’d overwhelm the list (I’ve also exempted my cohosts of &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide&lt;/a&gt;, who are also awesome and deserve non-biased accolades). So, I’ve added a few women I thought deserved special mention. There are many more, like &lt;a href="http://www.twis.org/"&gt;Dr. Kiki Sanford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pandagon.net"&gt;Amanda Marcotte&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.secular.org/bios/Lori_Lipman_Brown.html"&gt;Lori Lipman Brown&lt;/a&gt;. I hope when I ask again next year, they come to your collective brains as easily as the men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other runners-up who were nominated via Twitter and Facebook: Brian Dunning for doing Skeptoid and The Skeptologists, &lt;a href="http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk"&gt;Sense About Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for their wonderful report on Celebs and Pseudoscience, Mark Crislip of &lt;a href="http://www.quackcast.com/"&gt;Quackcast&lt;/a&gt;,  Barack Obama of the 2008 US Presidential Elections for a thus-far mostly-promising commitment to science, and Jan Meshon of &lt;a href="http://www.Freethoughtaction.org"&gt;FreethoughtAction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the results of the Top 10, along with some comments from Twitter (and Facebook, connected to my Twitter account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Amanda Peet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/8740/cookiemagazineaugust20cp7.jpg" alt="Amanda Peet"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I can hear you bitching already. “But she’s just an actress!” “She has no scientific training!” “Where’s her blog?” Well, guess what? That’s what makes her awesome. Like it or not, actors have the attention of the world on absolutely any subject they’d like to discuss, which is why a coconut-skull like Jenny McCarthy can convince so many otherwise rational people to put their (and other parents’) children at risk by not having them vaccinated. Amanda Peet actually had the ovaries to step up and declare that she had her daughter vaccinated, that the science supports the safety of vaccinations, and that further, as an &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/AutismNews/Story?id=5483159"&gt;actress she has no special knowledge or authority that should convince anyone to listen to her opinions&lt;/a&gt;. How often does anyone admit something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as ignorant celebs can make the world worse, well-informed and equally-outspoken celebs can make the world better. Let’s hope for more people like Amanda Peet in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Ben Goldacre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Ben Goldacre" src="http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/3432/bensmallzh6.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="211"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Goldacre  of &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net"&gt;Bad Science&lt;/a&gt; had a banner year, most notably taking down Matthias Rath, #6 on our &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4813"&gt;Top 10 Jackasses of 2008&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ll recall, Rath is the bastard who sold vitamins to cure AIDS patients in Africa, and who then sued Ben and The Guardian for pointing the fact out. Neither Ben nor The Guardian backed down, and they won their case. In addition, Ben &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/12/the-year-in-bad-science-2/"&gt;did a lot of other stuff this year&lt;/a&gt;, too, keeping a watchful eye on UK scam artists and pushers of bad science. He’s tenacious, vigilant, funny, and pretty damned cute, which doesn’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*UPDATE* I can’t believe I forgot to mention that Ben also had an ass-kicking, best-selling book debut this year, appropriately titled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bad-Science-Ben-Goldacre/dp/0007240198/?tag=bs0b-21"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Go buy it, and enjoy seeing the media’s treatment of science and medicine completely eviscerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Thunderf00t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vault101Dweller&lt;/strong&gt;: [...] Thunderf00t for lack of a better term owning VFX in that DMCA debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I documented &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Thunderf00t"&gt;Thunderf00t&lt;/a&gt;’s epic takedown of VenomFangX &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3477"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so go read that if you need to catch up. As wonderful as that epic win was, it was merely the icing on the delicious cake of scientific knowledge that Thunderf00t has been baking for a long time now (I’m going to drop that metaphor now, thanks). His &lt;em&gt;Why Do People Laugh at Creationists&lt;/em&gt; series, going since 2007, is a concise, easy-to-understand, and entertaining explanation that will arm anyone with the knowledge they need to address the most common creationist claims. Go to his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Thunderf00t"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;, where he’s collected them all in a playlist that lets you play multiple hours of pwnage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Orac&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1365/6923434979f533f29fid4.jpg" alt="Orac?"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wackyvorlon&lt;/strong&gt;: Orac has my vote. He’s been on the front lines fighting the anti-vaccinationists for years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orac’s been fighting pseudoscience online since well before I knew what a blog was. As a self-proclaimed egotistical surgeon/scientist (the self-proclaimed was for the adjective, not the nouns), he uses logic, reason, and good old fashioned science to dissect the claims of anti-vaccinationists like Jenny McCarthy (#3 on our list of Jackasses) and creationists like Michael Egnor. Orac has inspired countless other bloggers to tackle medical quackery, plus he supports all other areas of skepticism by running the bi-monthly Skeptics’ Circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one has ever seen Orac (not even his wife), but apparently he’s some kind of . . . bottle of glue? Named EneMan? I’m not sure. Apparently that’s his mascot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Susan Jacoby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/8223/fepr08030510qabz6.jpg" alt="Susan Jacoby"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you read &lt;em&gt;The Age of American Unreason&lt;/em&gt;, like me, you probably spent the following few weeks cowering under your bed, weeping quietly for humanity. &lt;a href="http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/3683/2008031012kw9.jpg"&gt;Susan Jacoby&lt;/a&gt;’s scholarly, expansive tome plunges through history, sorting out the bullshit from the truth, and showing how over time we’ve come to abandon logic, reason, and intellectual rigor in favor of the irrational and brainless. If you want to know why our Top 10 Jackasses were able to con so many people, look no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually disagreed with her on some points – particularly, her bashing of the Internet – but was always impressed with her ability to back up her assertions and make me think about my own assumptions. While the book isn’t the most optimistic thing I read this year, I still found it to be inspiring. By exhaustively detailing the things that were right in the past and the causes of why things have gone wrong, we can focus more on correcting ourselves to make way for a better, less credulous future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Simon Singh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Simon Singh" src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/7341/682cpj1.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="263"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reed Esau&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): Simon Singh, for not taking the easy way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe Reed was referring to &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;’s ongoing legal battle with a group of angry chiropractors (British Chiropractic Association) who are suing him over his less-than-complimentary essays on their “complementary” services. This may all sound familiar to regular readers, because I wrote about it &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=2200"&gt;back in August&lt;/a&gt;. The suit is still going on today, as Simon and The Guardian (who may deserve an award of their own for also sticking up for Ben Goldacre, above) force the BCA to produce evidence proving that what Simon wrote was untrue. That evidence has yet to be found, strongly suggesting that Simon was correct: chiropractors are promising miracle cures for diseases they cannot actually cure. (By the way, join the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=33457048634"&gt;Facebook group to support Simon here&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the lawsuit, this is the year Simon came out with the excellent book &lt;em&gt;Trick or Treatment&lt;/em&gt;, in which he and Edzard Ernst lay waste to countless alternative medicine quack treatments. You should buy it, and you should buy another one for the person in your life who says, “Well there must be &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to it, since the Chinese have been using it for 6 billion years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Sanal Edamaruku&lt;a href="http://www.rationalistinternational.net/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/3683/2008031012kw9.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda Rose&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): Oh I vote for Sanal Edamaruku too. http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/25/skeptic-giggles-on-i.html&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanal is the Indian rationalist &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1129"&gt;who was threatened with death by a “powerful” tantrik’s death chants&lt;/a&gt;. On live TV, Sanal laughed as the Tantrik danced around him while calling upon the gods to strike him dead, for two full hours. He captured the attention of millions who lived in fear of such superstitions, and unflinchingly proved to them that it was all nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incredible popularity of the stunt brought Sanal’s groups the &lt;a href="http://indianrationalists.blogspot.com/"&gt;Indian Rationalist Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rationalistinternational.net"&gt;Rationalist International&lt;/a&gt; into the limelight, showing the entire world that English-speaking countries don’t have the monopoly on skeptical heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. (TIE) Phil Plait&lt;a href="http://www.randi.org"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Phil Plait" src="http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/7703/skepdudecalendarbigtl3.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="249"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cabose&lt;/strong&gt;: Phil Plait. Reason: Death from the Skies. I think he wins now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eafarris&lt;/strong&gt;: Gotta be @badastronomer. Witness http://zi.ma/4a01 and http://zi.ma/35bd55&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;trianglman&lt;/strong&gt;: @badastronomer ’s Death from the Skies kicks a lot of ass (at least the first part that I’ve read so far)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JHVanOphem&lt;/strong&gt;: My vote is for @badastronomer His endless energy led him to the JREF Presidency and the future looks bright indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, friend-of-Skepchick Phil Plait has to make the list! The newly chosen president of the James Randi Education Foundation, author of &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death From the Skies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and longtime skeptic had an amazing year. He’s now reaching more people than ever with his inspiring awe for science and his canny ability to call out bullshit when he sees it. Plus, he’s a complete and total nerd who gushes about &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt;, and other lovably dorky topics. And did I mention he posed in the Skepdude calendar? Is it any wonder we all love him? He got tons of votes in the Twitter poll – in fact, just about exactly as many as . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. (TIE) PZ Myers&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CoffeeJedi&lt;/strong&gt;: PZ Meyers for Crackergate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teambanzai&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m going with PZ Myers. Reason being how he handled the Exposed mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Rosch&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): . . . the winner I think is PZ, because he was expelled from Expelled, broke into the Expelled tele-conference to plug expelledexposed.com, Crackergate (the story that wouldn’t die), and now w/ him getting credit for thwarting the alliance btw. the Cincinnati Zoo &amp;amp; the Creation Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s controversial, political, unapologetic, skeptical, and hilarious – he’s our own PZ Myers of the popular blog &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;. As his Twitter nominations suggest, he won this spot on the list by kicking the asses of two of our top 10 jackasses: Ben Stein and Bill Donohue. For Ben, PZ caused an uproar when he was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/expelled.php"&gt;expelled from Expelled&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1190"&gt;burst into a faux-press conference&lt;/a&gt;, almost literally stealing the show. Recently, also as mentioned by Michael on Facebook, PZ even managed to sink a deal between the Cincinnati Zoo and the Creation Museum, earning him even more ire from the crazies. I’ve yet to see him back down from any challenge, and I fully expect him to continue kicking ass well into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And look at how he snuggles that squid. Awwwww.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Marcus Seda’s Brother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Beaker" src="http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/1955/lylebeakerkz1.gif" alt="" width="240" height="320"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcus Seda&lt;/strong&gt; (via Facebook): My brother the science teacher. He shows movies like “the Core” and “the Day After Tomorrow” to point out the bad science theirin. He also uses the Onion to show how not everything you read is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of you but Marcus (and possibly his brother) are probably wondering, “WTF?” I assure you, this isn’t a Time-Person-of-the-Year-like cop-out, since I’m not naming YOU the number one skeptic. Instead, I’m giving the honor to the teachers and parents who are reaching kids and instilling in them a love of science and the ability to tell fantasy from reality. I wanted to populate this list with people who had really accomplished something this year – something tangible – and hey, who have accomplished more than those people with the direct connection to our future society’s ability to reason?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please, help me out here. In the comments, I’d like for you to nominate a teacher, parent, or other skeptic who has directly affected someone’s life for the better this year. As I asked the Twitter crowd: please show your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Thanks to Tkingdoll &amp;amp; DC Turner for the pretty badges for our winners to have! &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now I know such an aim is probably impossible, but I aim at this anyway. If someone can show where I mischaracterized his or her arguments I'm the first person who wants to know. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What grates on me to no end is people who don't give a damn to do likewise with my arguments. These people, on both sides of the fence, get little more than my distain. I have been known to berate them, ridicule and taunt them. I probably shouldn't do this, but sometimes I cannot resist. That's just who I am. That's what I sometimes do with people who are intellectually dishonest with what I say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am first and foremost a freethinker. That's who I am. I left the cookie-cutter mentality of defending the party line when I left the church. Whether you are a skeptic or a Christian if your arguments are lame I will probably point them out. Why? Because I am interested in the truth. If you don't like this then I cannot help you. If I am wrong show me. Unlike many people who debate these issues I am willing to listen. I really am. But you must be respectful; you must not purposely (or ignorantly) mischaracterize my arguments; you must try to be objective with the evidence; and you must show yourself to be willing to think through the issues rather than quoting from proof-texts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently I have been defending the belief that there was an apocalyptic doomsday prophet in the first century named Jesus who was the basis for the Christian cult itself. I could be wrong. If I'm wrong show me. I'm interested in every issue but I can only focus on the important ones. Some of the vitriol coming from the skeptical crowd reminds me of how Christians have divided into separate denominations over and over about mere trifles. I guess we're all just humans after all. We want everyone to agree with us. If someone is out of line we want him to get in line. If that person doesn't do this we tend to write him off as being ignorant, because we tend to think it's because of ignorance he disagrees. This saddens me to no end. I have no solutions to this type of fundamentalist thinking, but it is fundamentalist thinking! It's probably just part of the human condition. We want people to think exactly like us, even on unimportant trifles. And if they don't we write them off, even if we agree with them 90% of the time. Is that stupid or what? There I go myself. *slap* Why can't we at least be smart enough to choose our battles wisely and focus on the majors rather than on the minors? Knowing the difference between them is a mark of an educated person, although not even that seems to be enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Since I'm not likely to
have time to write while I'm away, I'm taking the opportunity to re-run an old classic series
of posts on numbers, which were first posted in the summer of 2006. These posts are mildly
revised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of the annoying things about how we write numbers is the fact that we generally write things one of two ways: as fractions, or as decimals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; You might want to ask, "Why is that annoying?" (And in fact, that's what I want you to ask, or else there's no point in my writing the rest of this!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It's annoying because both fractions and decimals can both only describe
&lt;em&gt;rational&lt;/em&gt; numbers - that is, numbers that are a perfect ratio of two integers. 
The problem with that is that &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; numbers aren't rational. Our standard
notations are &lt;em&gt;incapable&lt;/em&gt; of representing the precise values of the overwhelming majority of numbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But it&amp;#39;s even more annoying than that: if you use decimals, then there are lots of
rational numbers that you can&amp;#39;t represent exactly (i.e., 1/3); and if you use fractions, then
it&amp;#39;s hard to express the idea that the fraction isn&amp;#39;t exact. (How do you write π as a
fraction? 22/7 is a standard fractional approximation, but how do you say π, which is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; 22/7?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we do?&lt;/p&gt;

Addition of the modifier "two-bit" is entirely optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the story. Local citizen walks into the &lt;b&gt;Public&lt;/b&gt; Library, and notices that it is displaying a Christian nativity scene. He asks to meet with the library director to complain. This, of course, violates the God-given right of Christians to use state resources to trumpet their piety in the public square exclusively, so &lt;a href="http://www.atheistrev.com/2008/12/patron-who-complained-about-indiana.html"&gt;stark raving hysteria erupts&lt;/a&gt;. The director makes counter-accusations, lies to the local media, and suggests that the nasty little atheist ought not to use the library if he dislikes it. Other library employees &lt;a href="http://74.125.45.132/search?q=cache%3Awww.elwoodindiana.org%2Felwood-library-nativity-display&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a"&gt;post an exaggerated version of the incident to the web&lt;/a&gt;. Now the poor guy is worried about his safety and that of his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson to you. If you are an atheist, you do not have a right to object to religion being thrust in your face. Sit down and shut up.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Especially if you are living in a place like Peckerwood, Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;I'm not being original. I bet half the kids in that town already call it that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;You know I&amp;#39;m being sarcastic. The real message is that you might as well stand up and holler louder — polite restraint gains you nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/a_suggestion_for_elwood_indian.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/498631120" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230646929932"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/heres_one_for_dr_egnor_grand_rounds_is_a.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/67efee5c52d1f1ee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">Here's one for Dr. Egnor: Grand Rounds is about the interface of medicine and evolution!</title><published>2008-12-30T13:20:45Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T13:20:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/498611193/heres_one_for_dr_egnor_grand_rounds_is_a.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/heres_one_for_dr_egnor_grand_rounds_is_a.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here's one for our favorite &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=egnor+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;creationist neurosurgeon&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.moneduloides.com/?p=850"&gt;A whole Grand Rounds&lt;/a&gt;

I am most grateful to Victor Steinbok for alerting Language Log to an article in the &lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; (the link will be given below) about how singing the old song "The Hokey Cokey" could be defined as a hate crime, at least in Scotland.  You might like to reflect for a minute, before I give you the link, on how this song could conceivably stir up hatred against any racial, religious, ethnic, or cultural group. A sample of the lyrics (you can &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/tweenies/songtime/songs/h/hokeycokey.shtml"&gt;read the whole of the lyrics here&lt;/a&gt;):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt; You put your left arm in, your left arm out&lt;br&gt; In out, in out, you shake it all about&lt;br&gt; You do the Hokey Cokey and you turn around&lt;br&gt; That's what it's all about&lt;br&gt; Whoa-o the Hokey Cokey&lt;br&gt; Whoa-o the Hokey Cokey&lt;br&gt; Whoa-o the Hokey Cokey&lt;br&gt; Knees bent, arms stretched&lt;br&gt; Raa raa raa… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think a while: how could those words whip up hate and inter-communal strife, endangering the public order?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3883838/Doing-the-Hokey-Cokey-could-be-hate-crime.html"&gt;here is the link to the &lt;i&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/i&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; so you can check your guess.  Hint: Glasgow has two soccer teams.  Against my better judgment I have opened comments.  But do not write anything that would offend any racial, religious, ethnic, or cultural group.  Language Log loves and respects all racial, religious, ethnic, and cultural groups. (Well, most.)  We absolutely will not put up with intolerance here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Apparently there is at least one blogger out there who can, in defending Dr. Egnor, demonstrate that sometimes all it takes is one sentence from a post for me to recognize someone with no science or critical thinking skills whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm referring to someone who goes by the 'nym Country Shrink, who &lt;a href="http://www.thecountryshrink.com/?p=118"&gt;did not take kindly to one of the rebuttals&lt;/a&gt; of Dr. Egnor's nonsense, specifically &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=324"&gt;that of Dr. Kimball Atwood IV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The pyramid-like machines use quartz crystals, selenite (a clear form of the mineral gypsum), semi-precious lapis lazuli stones, gold leaf and copper coil to absorb and recycle the supposedly-negative energy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s what I like about new agers today.  They don’t just want to get rid of the negative energy, they want to &lt;em&gt;recycle&lt;/em&gt; it.  This is &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt; woo!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what is this “orgone science” solution, exactly?  The Skeptics’ Dictionary has a piece on &lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/orgone.html"&gt;Orgone Energy&lt;/a&gt; and its creator, Wilhelm Reich:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reich claimed to have created a new science (orgonomy) and to have discovered other entities, such as bions, which to this day only orgonomists can detect. Bions are alleged vesicles of orgone energy which are neither living nor non-living, but transitional beings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reich died on November 3, 1957, in the Federal Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was sent for criminal contempt. The criminal charge was levied because Reich refused to obey an injunction against selling quack medical devices such as the Orgone Accumulator and orgone &amp;quot;shooters,&amp;quot; devices which allegedly could collect and distribute orgone energy, thereby making possible the cure for  just about any medical disorder except, perhaps, megalomania and self-delusion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, read The Straight Dope’s &lt;a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/666/whats-the-story-on-wilhelm-reich-and-his-orgone-energy"&gt;What&amp;#39;s the story on Wilhelm Reich and his orgone energy?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Orgone Away&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;[Note: the above headline should really have been “Orgone Conclusion,” but &lt;a href="http://cosmicconnie.blogspot.com/2007/04/orgone-conclusions.html"&gt;Connie beat me to it&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there is there is no such thing as Orgone energy.  You have an imaginary illness.  Don’t worry, it can be cured by an imaginary therapy.  Perfect.  Good woo cancels out bad woo.  Well, recycles it, anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, there’s no good evidence that Wi-Fi networks like this can cause any of the illnesses suggested.  On the contrary, there have been several studies that show supposed Wi-Fi sensitive people can’t even tell if there is a Wi-Fi signal present or not when tested double-blind.  Which would tend to support the Nocebo hypothesis (a placebo in reverse – giving the appearance of harm rather than the appearance of good).  Plus there is no known scientific reason why such illnesses should result from Wi-Fi, which is a relatively low power signal.  TechSkeptic’s article on &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2008/12/dect-scares.html"&gt;DECT scares&lt;/a&gt;, although written to cover a slightly different aspect of microwave scares, is a good primer on the general issues, and includes links to the double-blind studies I mentioned.  You could also read the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs304/en/"&gt;Electromagnetic fields and public health&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s get real.  Quoting soothsayers and astrologers as authorities to support these claims is a bit like getting in a Feng Shui practitioner to tell us if &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/articles.asp?id=2"&gt;a bridge is safe or not&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.orgoneproducts.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.orgoneproducts.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Orgone pyramids" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105369d3928970b-800wi" style="margin:3px;width:454px;height:302px" title="Orgone pyramids"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.orgoneproducts.org/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;… for pyramidiots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230611464324"><id gr:original-id="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=166">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75bcfdf223474cd6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Housecleaning"/><title type="html">The 2008 Ashley Awards</title><published>2008-12-29T02:54:40Z</published><updated>2008-12-29T02:54:40Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=166" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://autism-news-beat.com/" type="html">&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;Overall, mainstream press coverage of autism spectrum disorders improved in 2008, as more major media outlets bravely recognized that deadly childhood diseases are a bad thing, and it is a good thing when we can prevent them. And there seemed to be a growing recognition that “overwhelming scientific consensus” is not the same as “according to Jenny McCarthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some news coverage experienced signs of developmental regression, including incomprehensible script talk and ratings-driven self stimulation. The most tragic examples are hereby recognized with the first-annual Ashley Award for Credulity in Science Journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first envelope please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/swilson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img title="swilson" src="http://autism-news-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/swilson.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="149"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the category of Most Uncritical Repetition of Urban Myths by a Local News Celebrity, the first Ashley goes to &lt;strong&gt;Steve Wilson&lt;/strong&gt; of WXYZ in Detroit, for &lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/content/news/investigators/story/Wilson-Some-Vaccines-Still-Contain-Mercury/2qKdWV73REiVLhJB8ztX_Q.cspx"&gt;Some Vaccines Still Contain Mercury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tough to beat Wilson for sheer tenacity as he packs 16 false and misleading claims into 7 minutes of wasted air time, for a nonsense/minute ratio of 2.3. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Amish “generally shun” vaccines, and autism is rare in their population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eleven scheduled pediatric vaccines still contain as much thimerosal as ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boyd Haley is a leading vaccine researcher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feds conceded that vaccines caused autism in Hannah Poling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Wilson fails to mention&lt;/em&gt;: No respected medical body or government institution has ever found a connection between vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus points&lt;/em&gt;: Wilson &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/07/antivax_lies_from_a_local_repo.php#comment-972729"&gt;attempted to defend himself&lt;/a&gt; to a critical science blogger by repeating the same false and misleading anti-vaccine talking points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;•  •  •&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award for &lt;em&gt;Creating an Illusion of Balance to Overcome Unequal Evidence&lt;/em&gt; goes to the eponymous &lt;strong&gt;Ashley Reynolds&lt;/strong&gt; of KOMU-TV for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.komu.com/satellite/SatelliteRender/KOMU.com/ba8a4513-c0a8-2f11-0063-9bd94c70b769/4c6f86c0-80ce-0971-00bf-a0b363625a33"&gt;Combating Autism from Within&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, an hour-long paean to medical quackery and child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds’ unflinching assault on reason and best available evidence combines shameless voyeurism with jaw-dropping credulity, thus setting the standard for the year’s most notable anti-vaccine propaganda. Anti-vaccine zealots returned the favor last May by inviting Reynolds to join &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ynPSutiMhQ&amp;amp;feature=channel_page"&gt;a media panel&lt;/a&gt; with the same folks who think the Amish don’t vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Reynolds fails to mention&lt;/em&gt;:  Dr. David Ayoub, whom Reynolds positions as a leading vaccine expert, openly states that the World Health Organization, Bill Gates, and the Rockefeller Foundation, &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6890106663412840646&amp;amp;ei=tm9YScODDYjkrgLSt_ngDg&amp;amp;q=ayoub+vaccines&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;use immunizations to sterilize poor women&lt;/a&gt; in Third World Countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus points&lt;/em&gt;: A pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Missouri’s School of Medicine wrote that he was “utterly horrified” at KOMU for “promoting a fear that endangers children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;•  •  •&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A late, late entry from &lt;strong&gt;Deborah Kotz&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/on-medicine/2008/12/29/flexible-approach-to-vaccinations-comes-under-fire.html"&gt;US News and World Report&lt;/a&gt; snags the &lt;em&gt;Clear Conflict of Interest&lt;/em&gt; award, for this clear case of unclear attribution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, the lead author, Paul Offit, who heads the vaccine education center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; has a conflict of interest. He’s one of the patent holders of RotaTeq, a vaccine against rotavirus that’s on the AAP’s vaccine schedule. That means he stands to lose money if parents shun RotaTeq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotz works with Dr. Bernadine Healy, the former head of the NIH and outspoken vaccine critic, and current medical editor at USN&amp;amp;WR. So clearly Kotz has a conflict of interest when reporting on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding. See how easy that was?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Kotz fails to mention&lt;/em&gt;:  Offit clearly has no conflict of interest. He assigned the rights for RotaTeq to his institutions and the institutions have sold future rights to another group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bonus points&lt;/em&gt;: Information on the RotaTeq patent is clearly public and clearly accessible to anyone clear on the concept of responsible journalism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230611196650"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/another_atheist_bashing.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/edf2bc833f6f8892</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Another atheist bashing</title><published>2008-12-30T03:45:58Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T03:45:58Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/498285386/another_atheist_bashing.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/another_atheist_bashing.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ho hum, it's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/29/darwin-anniversary-atheism?commentpage=8&amp;amp;commentposted=1"&gt;Madeleine Bunting&lt;/a&gt;, who we've encountered &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/03/the_dawkinsdennett_boogeyman.php"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. Her essay starts out well enough, cheering on the coming Darwin celebrations, explaining how this is a great opportunity for the promotion of science, etc., etc., etc., &lt;i&gt;but&lt;/i&gt;—there&amp;#39;s always a but—oh, deary me, it&amp;#39;s going to be hijacked by those dreadful atheists. We have to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; something about all the baggage that has been piled on poor Darwin's deceased back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the first imperative for the anniversary is to strip away the accumulation of mythology that has made Darwin such a villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait…for an article that is supposedly praising Darwin, what is this about his villainy? I certainly don&amp;#39;t think of him as one; the scientists I know are all on his side; it&amp;#39;s only those crazy ideologues, the creationists, who attach such opprobrium to his name. We quickly discover what equals villainy in Bunting&amp;#39;s mind: atheism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, what would have baffled Darwin is his recruitment as standard bearer for atheism in the 21st century. Darwin kept his pronouncements on religion to a minimum, partly out of respect for his Christian wife. Despite continuing claims that he was an atheist, most scholars acknowledge that he never went further than agnosticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, we know. We've read his memoirs. We know he was unreligious, but was also conservative and cautious, and preferred to call himself an agnostic. No one knowledgeable is saying otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he would not have been baffled at all by atheists celebrating his ideas. He well knew himself that evolution stripped the need for a creator as a guiding force in the history of life — it&amp;#39;s one of the reasons he hesitated to publish, and he knew that it would be detested by the clergy. He felt that revealing his secret was &amp;quot;like confessing a murder,&amp;quot; and he &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; that evolution was fully compatible with atheism but in conflict with many interpretations of religious belief. Baffled? Heck no. He &lt;i&gt;expected&lt;/i&gt; us, even as he feared the consequences. Darwin removed one of the last obstacles to dispensing altogether with the notion of gods, and he knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So certainly atheists will be celebrating this year. Is there something wrong with that? To Bunting, this is apparently deplorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fear is that the anniversary will be hijacked by the New Atheism as the perfect battleground for another round of jousting over the absurdity of belief (a position that Darwin pointedly never took up). Many of the prominent voices in the New Atheism are lined up to reassert that it is simply impossible to believe in God and accept Darwin's theory of evolution; Richard Dawkins and the US philosopher Daniel Dennett are among those due to appear in Darwin200 events. It's a position that infuriates many scientists, not to mention philosophers and theologians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well? Should Dawkins and Dennett stay home this year? Should only professing Christians who are scientists be allowed to speak in praise of Darwin in public?  She seems upset that atheists will actually be given a voice in the Darwin bicentennial!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let those philosophers and theologians, and even those scientists, be infuriated. Religion is ridiculous, and we aren't going to be silenced because a few people maintain a ludicrous deference for old myths.&lt;/p&gt;

Just more of the same ol', same ol', with nothing much of substance to grapple with. Let's tackle &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2008/dec/29/religion-new-atheism-defined?commentpage=1&amp;amp;commentposted=1"&gt;Andrew Brown's complaints&lt;/a&gt; first. Brown is not a stupid fellow, but I see here a hint of irrationally roused hackles, with little explanation of what exactly he is complaining about.  First he names a few of the people he identifies as New Atheists, and then he lists what he considers to be defining characters of this group. Look who he names: I made the grade!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, who are they? The ideas I claim are distinctive of the new atheists have been collected from Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Jerry Coyne, the American physicist Robert L. Park, and a couple of blogging biologists, P Z Myers and Larry Moran. They have two things in common. They are none of them philosophers and, though most are scientists, none study psychology, history, the sociology of religion, or any other discipline which might cast light on the objects of their execration. All of them make claims about religion and about believers which go far beyond the mere disbelief in God which I take to be the distinguishing mark of an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an unfortunate paragraph, though. He reached for a couple of bloggers to throw in the pot and notes the dreadful lack of philosophers in our ranks…but alas, he seems to have neglected a few rather more prominent names, which damage his premise rather severely. Where&amp;#39;s Dan Dennett? Shouldn&amp;#39;t he have been named right there with Dawkins, Harris, and Hitchens? Perhaps because he is a philosopher, he isn&amp;#39;t &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; a New Atheist. And what about A.C. Grayling? He always seems to be vociferously godless, and he certainly ought to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think it is &lt;i&gt;required&lt;/i&gt; that one be a philosopher to be able to be loudly atheist, anyway. Brown notes that this is a political and social movement, which is true, and denies that there's anything intellectual about it, which I deny. Philosophers do not have a monopoly on social, political, or intellectual issues, so it is rather irrelevant. He might as well have noted that there is an absence of plumbers in his list, which means we must all be unqualified to discuss politics or the economy. Neither are any of us named Joe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let that pass. Brown does something interesting: he attempts to define the six characteristic premises of the New Atheism, and invites everyone to keep score. OK! Let's see how I stack up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is something called "Faith" which can be defined as unjustified belief held in the teeth of the evidence. Faith is primarily a matter of false propositional belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. "Unjustified" I'll accept, but I don't agree that faith is &lt;i&gt;necessarily&lt;/i&gt; false. Still, I'll give it to him in my case: +1 for PZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cure for faith is science: The existence of God is a scientific question: either he exists or he doesn't. "Science is the only way of knowing - everything else is just superstition" [Robert L. Park]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there are two things muddled up here, and I accept part but not the other. The existence of a god certainly is a scientific question. If there exists a prime mover or a cosmic watchmaker or a meddling tinkerer or a thunderbolt-flinging patriarch, and if it had or is having an effect on the universe, then yes, god is something we should be able to detect. If god is some nebulous entity that is not part of or is not involved in affecting our existence, then it is irrelevant and can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t think science is the cure for faith. It can be, for some of us, but for others there is a welter of emotional and social issues that are tied up in belief, too. I can give myself only ½ point here, but maybe I&amp;#39;d deserve a full point if the assertion weren&amp;#39;t so confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science is the opposite of religion, and will lead people into the clear sunlit uplands of reason. "The real war is between rationalism and superstition. Science is but one form of rationalism, while religion is the most common form of superstition" [Jerry Coyne] "I am not attacking any particular version of God or gods. I am attacking God, all gods, anything and everything supernatural, wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented." [Dawkins]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He does it again! I like the quotes, but Coyne&amp;#39;s comment rather clearly states some complexities in the two concepts that belie the Manichean conflict Brown tries to set up. I can only award myself ½ point here, although if he&amp;#39;d just presented the quotes without his strange interpretation it would have gotten a full thumbs up from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this great struggle, religion is doomed. Enlightened common sense is gradually triumphing and at the end of the process, humanity will assume a new and better character, free from the shackles of religion. Without faith, we would be better as well as wiser. Conflict is primarily a result of misunderstanding, of which Faith is the paradigm. (Looking for links, I just came across a lovely example of this in the endnotes to the Selfish Gene, where lawyers are dismissed as "solving man-made problems that should never have existed in the first place".)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope, I disagree 100% with this one. I don&amp;#39;t see religion as doomed at all; there&amp;#39;s plenty of evidence that many people will happily swallow all kinds of fabulous pixie dust to think that atheism is destined to succeed. It&amp;#39;s going to be an uphill struggle all the way. I also don&amp;#39;t believe that being godless is sufficient to be a good, wise person, nor that people afflicted with superstition must be evil and stupid. That does not mean, however, that we shouldn&amp;#39;t vigorously oppose stupid ideas…like religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion exists. It is essentially something like American fundamentalist protestantism, or Islam. More moderate forms are false and treacherous: if anything even more dangerous, because they conceal the raging, homicidal lunacy that is religion's true nature. [Sam Harris]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another goose-egg for Brown, I'm afraid. His first two words are OK, but the rest is garbage. My personal image of religion isn't fundamentalist at all, but the quietly gullible, unquestioning, moderate faith of my mother's family. I don't think it usually causes serious conflict, let alone "raging, homicidal lunacy", but it does undercut critical thinking, and as we've seen in the past few years in America, that's dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because that faith doesn't lead to loud rants against perceived wickedness or parishioners spasming on the floor or mobs with torches doesn't mean it isn't &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;, though, and it's that to which I object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith, as defined above, is the most dangerous and wicked force on earth today and the struggle against it and especially against Islam will define the future of humanity. [Everyone]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, this is getting bad. No, all the way through. I don&amp;#39;t especially pick on Islam — it&amp;#39;s not a major force in my neighborhood — and hey, doesn&amp;#39;t this contradict his previous claim, where we&amp;#39;re supposed to find more moderate forms of religion &amp;quot;even more dangerous&amp;quot; than Islam? I think religion is an enabling error that is patently false, and one that is made worse by the studious attempt of so many to make excuses for it. But if, for instance, religion evaporated in the Middle East tomorrow, I don&amp;#39;t think peace and fellowship would descend on the region: nationalism, ethnic bigotry, and historical grudges would guarantee that danger and wickedness would continue. It would remove &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; obvious contributor to stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, crap. I got a grand total of 2 out of 6. Andrew is going to have to strike my name from the distinguished list of New Atheists. Maybe that will make room for Dan Dennett…but somehow, I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;ll get a very high score, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess he'll have to try again. Maybe next time, Andrew can also lay out what he finds objectionable about the New Atheists himself, rather than just tossing out definitions and pretending their heinousness is self-evident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/oh_no_the_new_atheists_are_get.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/498239120" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230602855423"><id gr:original-id="http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/?p=460">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5d3f5c820b5c7bec</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Science Museum and MMR</title><published>2008-12-29T22:32:47Z</published><updated>2008-12-29T22:32:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://apgaylard.wordpress.com/2008/12/29/the-science-museum-and-mmr/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">The Science Museum's "mmr files" are generally excellent.

Now Elles has posted a review of the book by the same name &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/teen/?p=571"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so I expect to see even more. The funny thing is that I have to approve the first post anyone makes on this blog, and this recent influx has seen a lot of sad, nearly illegible rants that, if approved, would turn Skepchick into YouTube, or Myspace or something. I’m getting to the point where I’m more likely to delete a first comment on that thread than let one in, and it makes me feel a little sorry for the person who may wonder why they never see their post appear. I’ve taken to responding to as many as possible, and because there are so many I’ve taken to copying and pasting form letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who are new to Skepchick and are considering commenting, please consider this fair warning that your carefully crafted rant using your peculiar mix of English and lolspeak and text message and spittle may not ever be seen by anyone but me, if it isn’t at least a little polite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t post the actual comments, but you should be able to figure out what they were like by my responses. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there! Sorry, but we’ve deleted your comment because it didn’t meet our lowest standards for basic literacy, spelling, or decency. If you’d like to make your point with more wit or intelligence, please feel free to try again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regret to inform you that your comment was not published due to lack of intelligence. We recommend you try again using English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skepchick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but your comment (see below) will not reach the public due to: rudeness/uselessness. If you’d like to try again to meet the minimum standards to post on Skepchick, please do so at your leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepchick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your recent post on Skepchick (below). Unfortunately, it does not appear to be written in English. Skepchick is an English blog, and therefore all comments must also be in that language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepchick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post quoted below was rejected and therefore deleted before being seen by anyone in the general public. The reason is that you sound like an illiterate child who is unable to compose a sentence and master capital letters. Here’s hoping you learn to type before graduating high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck in life,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepchick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last one was particularly bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note, finally, that one person actually &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; try again and was approved – so, perhaps they can be trained to be functioning members of society.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230599592809"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/29/big-conjunction-on-december-30/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/94e2eebfc41aa767</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Big conjunction on December 30!</title><published>2008-12-30T00:39:49Z</published><updated>2008-12-30T00:39:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/29/big-conjunction-on-december-30/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just glanced out a window and was stunned by what I saw: Jupiter, the thin crescent Moon, Venus, and δ Capricornus all lined up nice ‘n pretty in the west.

Teenagers are just as likely to have sex after being told not to, and far worse, when they do have sex they don’t use protection. That increases the rate of STDs and pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/19/just-say-no-to-just-say-no/"&gt;If only we had known that before&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to that article,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking a [virginity] pledge doesn’t seem to make any difference at all in any sexual behavior,” said Janet E. Rosenbaum of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, whose report appears in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics. “But it does seem to make a difference in condom use and other forms of birth control that is quite striking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s get this straight. If you teach a kid only that sex is bad and they shouldn’t do it until they are married, they are still just as likely to go ahead and Do It. That is the opposite of what you want, obviously, and &lt;em&gt;you’re making it worse&lt;/em&gt; because unwanted pregnancies are likely to go up because of this. So what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is, stick your fingers in your ears and yell &amp;quot;LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA!&amp;quot; There has been some good news lately &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/06/29/some-states-are-embracing-reality/"&gt;with states rejecting abstinence-only education funds&lt;/a&gt;, but this kind of anti-reality garbage is unlikely to go down without a fight. I suspect its influence is waning; with the far-right losing its grip (except through obstructionism, and expect to see a lot of that coming) maintaining such nonsense will be harder. However, lots of Democrats like abstinence-only puffery as well, so it won’t go away any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is obvious. Teach kids in school all about health and their bodies. Then, if you want them to behave a certain way, &lt;em&gt;talk to them at home&lt;/em&gt;. That way, they have actual, y’know, &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, and you yourself as their parent can guide them in what you see as a moral direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have reached a watershed here, I think. If you don’t like them learning about their bodies in school, &lt;em&gt;that’s too frakking bad&lt;/em&gt;.

It seemed at first that he was making a reasonable critique: spending about $30,000,000 on a digital TV service for a language with no more than 50,000 speakers, all of them bilingual in English and most of them without digital TV, could be argued (though linguists aren't supposed to think this way) to be an enterprise of doubtful value.  But just as I was getting interested, Brown blundered into linguistics and revealed his dumb side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; I say language but Gaelic isn't one, not really. Its vocabulary is tiny, with no form of saying yes or no and attuned to a distant, pre-technological world. It's essentially a kind of rural patois, a bonsai idiolect; a way of specifying concepts central to a particular, highly codified way of life. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Yecchhh.  Everything about the layman's concept of a language that I rail against is there.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A language, for Allan Brown, is just a big bag of words, and Gaelic hasn't got enough of them to count as a language at all.  (You don't have a real language unless you have one that's just like mine in having one-word interjection-like sentence substitute particles for affirmation and denial; mine is a language, yours is just a patois, so there.)  He doesn't know what "idiolect" means, either.  (An idiolect, by definition, is spoken by just &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; person, not 50,000.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, bafflingly, he completely undercuts his thesis about the "tiny" vocabulary by making a point about it being super-rich rather than tiny:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt;You might think, for example, that the word sgriob is just a bad hand at Scrabble; it's actually the Gaelic word describing the tingle of anticipation felt in the upper lip before drinking whisky. The fact that Gaelic has a six-letter word for this while English has a twelve-word phrase reveals a lot about Gaelic ways and priorities. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No it doesn't.  It reveals nothing.  I happen to know a one-syllable word (&lt;i&gt;turd&lt;/i&gt;) for a piece of excrement shaped by its expulsion from the anal sphincter, but that doesn't reveal a lot about my ways and priorities.  It is a completely meaningless and useless random factoid about the lexicon of the language I happened to grow up speaking.  That lexicon also contains &lt;i&gt;scrum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;buttercup&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ogre&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bong&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;thorium&lt;/i&gt;.  If you try to form an impression of my ways and priorities from such things you're a moron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I say, Brown does make some fair points about the irrationalities and impracticabilities inherent in sentimental save-the-language political movements on behalf of moribund languages spoken only by old people; but as soon as he starts trying to talk about the linguistic properties themselves he becomes another gibbering fool mumbling the usual nonsense about nouns (the &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt; have no words for &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; but &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; different words for &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;, and all that hogwash).  He doesn't really know what a linguistic system is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said all this &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004450.html"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;. People just aren't listening.  Nobody listens.  I am like a man opening the door of a mountain cabin in a blizzard in order to howl into the wilderness that the snow should stop.  It will never stop.  Laypersons (forgive me, good lay readers of Language Log, I don't mean you) will never stop seeing a language as nothing more or less than a &lt;b&gt;big bag of words&lt;/b&gt;.  Or worse, I suppose, a tiny one.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Update: &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/29/russian-paper-promotes-moon-hoax/#comment-143911"&gt;In the comments&lt;/a&gt;, Al pointed out that this was indeed a puzzle for the readers, and not a promotion of the Hoax. Good on ya, Al!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s set up like a standard Apollo Moon Hoax question: two pictures from Apollo 17 are shown. In one, background mountains are visible, as is the lunar lander on the right. In the next picture, the mountains are still there, but the lander is gone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/apollo17_pans.jpg" alt="Two pans of an Apollo 11 EVA site"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, over on the right? In the top picture, the lander is obvious. In the second, it’s gone, replaced by a piece of equipment. The newspaper appears to claim that another astronaut must have been left on the Moon to take the picture, or some sort of goofiness like that (the reasoning is that if the lander is gone, and someone was still there to take the picture, then they must have stranded an astronaut on the Moon; I’ve heard this sort of thing before). &lt;a href="http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_url?doit=done&amp;amp;tt=url&amp;amp;intl=1&amp;amp;fr=bf-home&amp;amp;trurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.volgograd.kp.ru%2Fdaily%2F24217.4%2F419158%2F&amp;amp;lp=ru_en&amp;amp;btnTrUrl=Translate"&gt;I ran the article through an online translator&lt;/a&gt;, and of course some of the phrasing is ambiguous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it’s obvious: the pictures were taken at two different locations. The top one was near the lander, but the bottom one was from farther away. The mountains are so far away that they hardly appear to change, but in the foreground things changed a lot. It’s just perspective. I can even prove it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures are pans: multiple images stitched together to provide a much wider view of the Moon. The newspaper provides links to the Lunar and Planetary Institute page which hosts the pans (originals &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollopanoramas/pans/?pan=JSC2007e045384"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollopanoramas/pans/?pan=JSC2004e52772"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and there is a much higher-resolution image there. I looked at the second image, and what did I see in the background?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS17-147-22579"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/apollo17_pan_zoom.jpg" alt="Zoom in on the lander in one of the Apollo 17 pans"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. The lander is clearly visible &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS17-147-22579"&gt;in that image&lt;/a&gt;, way in the background. The astronaut obviously walked away from the mountains before taking the second series of images, making the lander look much smaller in relation to the more distant mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, kinda. I’m still wondering what the newspaper’s motivation is here. Is it just a puzzle for the readers, like the Junior Jumble or the acrostic? Or are they really trying to promote the nonsensical claim that NASA faked the Moon landings? Either way, it’s an opportunity for me to show you how to fight the kind of silliness usually tossed about by Moon Hoaxers. Remember: if someone tells you NASA faked the Apollo missions, there is something they aren’t telling you — like the proof they are completely wrong is in the very photo they’re showing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curiosity: I actually got a reprint request. Those are very strange — it used to be that you&amp;#39;d always get a flurry of these after publishing something, and you&amp;#39;d be sure to order lots of extra copies of your paper so you could send them out, but nowadays they are going the way of the dodo. It&amp;#39;s so much easier to download the paper from the journal&amp;#39;s electronic archives, and even when I get a request because of limited access, I can just email a pdf. I usually only get these from third world countries anymore. This one, though, was from the US. From Liberty University. Asking for a copy of my review of Miller&amp;#39;s book. Weird. Sorry, but I don&amp;#39;t have any paper copies of that article…and the request didn&amp;#39;t include an email address. How quaint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holiday card: it was from the &lt;a href="http://www.sffosu.org/"&gt;OSU Students for Freethought&lt;/a&gt;. May the FSM nod benignly upon you, and caress you all with his pastalicious appendages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Official Notice: my request for a sabbatical leave next year has been Officially Approved! Huzzah! I have big plans for some serious writing, new course development, and new research directions, and now I may actually get the time to do it all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/in_my_mailbox.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/497923223" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230574782851"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/29/presented-without-comment/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0e7a46fc292af904</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Antiscience"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Presented without comment</title><published>2008-12-29T17:58:04Z</published><updated>2008-12-29T17:58:04Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/29/presented-without-comment/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic construction here is what is traditionally called "extraposition from subject" (see e.g. &lt;a href="http://mercury.hau.ac.kr/kggc/Publications/SIGG/SIGG15/SIGG15202_JBKim.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for further discussion and examples). It involves an expletive ponoun &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (sometimes also called a "pleonastic" or "dummy" pronoun) in subject position, standing in for a sentence-final clause that might have been the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It's a shame that things turned out so badly. = That things turned out so badly is a shame.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It's not clear what she wanted. = What she wanted is not clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It's odd how well the timing worked out. = How well the timing worked out is odd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the sentence "It is a factual matter what is and is not syntactically correct" would be normal, though awkward because of the three repetitions of "is", the hard-to-parse "and", etc. The version with the what-clause in subject position would be "What is and is not syntactically correct is a factual matter".  However, adding  "as to" between "matter" and "what" is not only redundant, but (it seems to me) probably ungrammatical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly the result of putting the whole final constituent in subject position seems quite bad to me&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;*As to what is and is not syntactically correct is a factual matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even more obviously, the what-clause doesn't work as the subject:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;*What is and is not syntactically correct is a factual matter as to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So alternatively, we could try to analyze the initial "it" not as a dummy pronoun, but rather as as a regular pronoun, referring to the question of what is or is not syntactically correct. This would work if we set things up with an initial prepositional phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As to what is and is not syntactically correct, it is a factual matter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentence is pompous and awkward, but grammatical. However, this kind of pronominal reference generally doesn't work when a pronoun in a main clause tries to refer to something introduced later in the sentence.  For example, compare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;As to her motivations&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, they&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are hard for me to understand.&lt;br&gt;
*They&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are hard for me to understand(,) as to her motivations&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And similarly, I think that it doesn't work to analyze the initital "it" of Prof. Fish's sentence as referring to the distribution of syntactic correctness, introduced in the later clause headed by "what":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;*It&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a factual matter as to [ what is or is not syntactically correct ]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion is that in his distress, Prof. Fish got confused, and began his sentence with one construction while ending it with another. That happens to all of us from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I&amp;#39;ve missed an analysis — if so, please point it out in the comments, since this is one of many occasions in life when the lesson of John 8:3-11 is worth pondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Let me note that just as there are plenty of examples out there of redundant pronouns like the one that enraged Prof. Fish, there are also plenty of examples out there of the construction that he used in complaining about it. Here are a few of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It's strange as to what's happening.&lt;br&gt;
It is a factual matter as to whether the certifier has read the MDR regulation, whether the company has established a system to implement those regulations, and how many MDR's the company submitted to FDA as a result of following that system.&lt;br&gt;
Given the weight and density of concrete and the massive pumps that are required to do this, it's obvious as to why it's a difficult task.&lt;br&gt;
Wobuffet is an uber and it's simple as to why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the redundant pronouns, it turned out that &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004465.html"&gt;the phenomenon goes back to Middle English&lt;/a&gt;, though perhaps the analysis and the function have shifted. I wonder about the dynamics of &amp;quot;It is X as to WH-clause&amp;quot;. Is this an old construction, or a new development? I also wonder about the sociolinguistics — the examples that I&amp;#39;ve seen seem to come from two types of context: ponderously pompous contexts (&amp;quot;It is a factual matter as to whether the certifier…&amp;quot;) and breezily sub-standard contexts (&amp;quot;… and it&amp;#39;s simple as to why&amp;quot;).  Does this impression hold up under examination? ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230573465834"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2009://2.4046">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7b0ea31491cdf805</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="1000words" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="1000 words"/><title type="html">Eumorpha fasciatus</title><published>2008-12-29T18:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-29T08:24:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/eumorpha-fascia.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;b&gt;What Is Universally Quantified and Necessary&lt;br&gt;and A Posteriori and It Flies South in the Winter?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think it would embarrass a famous defender of the idea that we have innate knowledge of universal grammar if he unreflectingly wrote and published a sentence that violated an important constraint of universal grammar.  But it won't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coordinate Structure Constraint, as proposed by John Robert Ross in his MIT doctoral dissertation in 1967, says (I paraphrase) that an unfilled grammatical function logically associated with a fronted element (like the interrogative word &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; in this case) cannot be located inside one of the coordinates in a coordination if the fronted element is outside it.  (There is an exception for the case where the fronted element is associated with a grammatical function that is unfilled in &lt;small&gt;ALL&lt;/small&gt; of the coordinates, as in &lt;i&gt;What was&lt;/i&gt; [[&lt;i&gt;Fermat convinced he had proved __&lt;/i&gt;] [&lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt; Andrew Wiles finally successful in proving __&lt;/i&gt;]]]&lt;i&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;, but that will not be relevant here.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of the open interrogative that forms Fodor's title is a coordination of clauses, having this bracketing structure:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; [ [ &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt; is universally quantified and necessary and a posteriori&lt;/i&gt; ]&lt;br&gt;[ &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; [ &lt;i&gt;it flies south in the winter&lt;/i&gt; ] ] ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variable &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; stands semantically for the thing we seek in answer to the question.  Syntactically it is just a gap.  In order for the whole title to have the interrogative force intended, the &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; must have scope over all of the above.  That means it is outside the coordination delimited by the outermost brackets.  (There is another coordination inside, namely the adjective phrase coordination &lt;i&gt;universally quantified and necessary and a posteriori&lt;/i&gt;, but that is irrelevant.  The property I am concerned with would still be evident if you replaced that entire phrase by a single adjective such as &lt;i&gt;necessary&lt;/i&gt;.) Thus we have this structure for the whole thing:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; [ &lt;i&gt;what&lt;sub&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; [ [ &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt; is universally quantified and necessary and a posteriori&lt;/i&gt; ]&lt;br&gt;[ &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; [ &lt;i&gt;it flies south in the winter&lt;/i&gt; ] ] ] ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an embarrassment here, for those still capable of that emotion.  On the assumption that linguistic nativism is true, neurologically normal speakers and writers shouldn't come out with utterances that violate universal constraints on syntactic structure. Those universal constraints are supposed to be relatively immutable firmware that guides everybody's linguistic acquisition and use. They're not supposed to be just conventions like that you use the smaller fork for the salad.  They're supposed to be deep and (if the theory positing them has any real content) in some sense inviolable.  Yet Fodor's title violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint just as surely as Ross's original examples, like:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; *[ &lt;i&gt;whose tax&lt;sub&gt;&lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; [ [ &lt;i&gt;did the nurse polish her trombone&lt;/i&gt; ]&lt;br&gt;[ &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; [ &lt;i&gt;the plumber compute &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ] ] ] ] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ross's example does sound (deliberately) worse, mainly because he has embellished its wrong-soundingness by building it around a bizarrely non-serious scenario involving a plumber computing an income tax return while a nurse polishes her trombone in the background.  (Lack of seriousness was a serious part of the normal methodology of syntacticians back in the sixties.  Seriously.)  It also differs in having the variable as object in the second coordinate (the &lt;i&gt;compute&lt;/i&gt; clause) rather than subject in the first.  That might be the key difference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I am not saying Fodor has committed a crashing ungrammatical act.  It is important that his title sounds perfectly normal. It was accepted at the time without remark by the massed ranks of the American Philosophical Association, including me (I happened to be at the meeting in December 2005).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does that mean?  It could mean that Ross's statement of the constraint is wrong.  Or that there is no such constraint.  Or that sometimes we mistakenly process an ill-formed structure without noticing its ill-formedness.  I don't know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know is that presenting Jerry Fodor with this clear evidence that he may have inconsistent beliefs (that linguists have vindicated linguistic nativism by identifying numerous constraints like the Coordinate Structure Constraint that correspond to innate restrictions on syntactic form, and that he has uttered a sentence violating one of said alleged innate restrictions) will have no effect on him whatever.  He tends to speak of linguistic nativism as "the only game in town" for anyone who wants to understand how human beings could acquire language; and (he will feel) you don't quit the only game in town just because of one puzzling run of the cards.  So syntacticians still have some work to do: big fat hairy deal.  Linguistic nativism still rules even if linguists haven't figured out how to state the rules by which it rules.  That is the sort of thing he will say.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will just point out one other tiny little thing, which Fodor himself will have missed. (He does not do close reading of texts, even his own.  He will not read this either.)  When he came back to his title at the end of the lecture he was apparently unable to violate the constraint again.  This time he said the same thing in a slightly different and syntactically irreproachable form, referring to &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s universal and necessary and a posteriori and flies south in the winter.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different, you see.  &lt;font color="#007700"&gt;[I&amp;#39;ve changed the following, because it was simply mistaken before, as at least two readers spotted. —GKP]&lt;/font&gt; The structure involves a binary coordination.  The first conjunct itself contains a coordination (&lt;i&gt;is universal and necessary and a posteriori&lt;/i&gt;), and the second is another finite verb phrase, &lt;i&gt;flies south in the winter&lt;/i&gt;.   There is no violation of Ross's constraint, because there is no coordination of clauses in which one contains the gap and the other doesn't.  &lt;i&gt;What&lt;/i&gt; is associated with the subject function in a single clause that has a coordination of predicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the constraint guided Fodor the second time around?  Like an angel who lets you fall and skin your knee once, but then saves you when you nearly fall a second time?  Like I said, I simply don't know how these putative innate constraints are supposed to operate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists and evolutionists, Christians and non-Christians, all have the &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; evidence--the same facts. Think about it: we all have the same earth, the same fossil layers, the same animals and plants, the same stars—the facts are all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="dichotomy.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/29/dichotomy.jpeg" width="400" height="305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is in the way we all &lt;i&gt;interpret&lt;/i&gt; the facts. And why do we interpret facts differently? Because we start with different &lt;i&gt;presuppositions&lt;/i&gt;; these are things that are assumed to be true without being able to prove them. These then become the basis for other conclusions. All reasoning is based on presuppositions (also called axioms). This becomes especially relevant when dealing with past events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true, I do have some presuppositions. I think that explanations should deal with as much of the evidence as possible; they should avoid contradictions, both internal and with the evidence from the physical world; they should be logical; they should make predictions that can be tested; they should have some utility in addressing new evidence. It's not too much to ask, I don't think. "Darwin" is not one of my presuppositions, however. Charles Darwin provided a set of explanations that, after some modification, meet my criteria. I am quite prepared to throw Darwin out, however, if a better explanation came along or if evidence that contradicted his ideas were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not prepared to throw out logic and consistency. The creationists are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their cartoon version of equivalence highlights their problem. If we all have the same facts and just different interpretations based on what book we use as a starting premise, how do we discriminate between better interpretations? Are they all equally valid? Imagine &amp;quot;Darwin&amp;quot; replaced with &amp;quot;Koran&amp;quot; — do they really want to argue that the Islamic vision of the world is just as useful as the Christian view? (I would, of course, but that&amp;#39;s because I think both are foolish and narrow.) Swap in the Book of Mormon: that does not mean that suddenly there is truth to the notion of pale-skinned Hebrews warring across the New World in bronze chariots. The existence of &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; does not imply that Tolkien fans should believe the world really was populated with elves and orcs, once upon a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are presuppositions, and then there are presuppositions. We should at least try to test our premises, and I think we can all agree that it is possible to rank different presuppositions on the basis of how well they describe reality. Most of us can recognize that &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; are fictions, that what they describe doesn't exist, and that they probably aren't very good filters to use in evaluating paleontological evidence. That someone who has accepted The Force as his one true religion does not mean that his claim that &lt;i&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/i&gt; is a Wookie requires recognition as a reasonable interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Bible does not hold up well as a rational presupposition. Its descriptions of how the world works (and, as every rational person knows, it was not &lt;i&gt;intended&lt;/i&gt; as a science textbook) are inadequate and full of errors. The portions of the book of Genesis that creationists use as their sole source for the origin of life on Earth is only a few lines of vague poetry, with two self-contradicting accounts of the sequence of events…and it&amp;#39;s a sequence that does not correspond at all well to the observed record of events, and that blithely lumps fish and birds into one useless catch-all category. If this is their lens for viewing the world, it&amp;#39;s a cracked one that is almost entirely opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, the fact that the Bible contains one line that mentions a mythical creature called Behemoth does not mean it adequately accounts for all of large animal zoology, nor can one simply claim it is equivalent to a dinosaur, and therefore the Bible is a complete account of the history of life. Dinosaurs were diverse. And shouldn't it be a greater omission that the Bible fails to mention anything about &lt;i&gt;bacteria&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patently incomplete nature of the Bible&amp;#39;s descriptions of Earth&amp;#39;s history led honest creationists to admit that further understanding of the Creation required evaluation of the physical evidence. You can&amp;#39;t just claim that humans and dinosaurs coexisted 6,000 years ago: there is no fossil evidence that they were contemporaries, there is no sign of dinosaurs existing so close to the current time, and even within the period of the Mesozoic we can find evidence of faunal succession — the forms found in the Triassic are different from those of the Jurassic are different from those of the Cretaceous. It is not sufficient to simply claim the Bible is your presupposition, therefore you can freely invent facts to fit it — there ought to be &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; corroborating evidence that shows your interpretations are reasonable. There aren't any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And please, when your presuppositions lead to ridiculous assertions, it's time to question your premises. One of the examples this silly AiG article uses to justify its peculiar relativism is the interpretation of dating methods. Can you see the glaring problem in this rationale from the &lt;a href="http://toarchive.org/indexcc/CD/CD015.html"&gt;disgracefully sloppy work of Russell Humphreys&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the research from the creationist RATE group (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth) concerning the age of zircon crystals in granite. Using one set of assumptions, these crystals could be interpreted to be around 1.5 billion years old based on the amount of lead produced from the decay of uranium (which also produces helium). However, if one questions these assumptions, one is motivated to test them. Measurements of the rate at which helium is able to "leak out" of these crystals indicate that if they were much older than about 6,000 years, they would have nowhere near the amount of helium still left in them. Hence, the originally applied assumption of a constant decay rate is flawed; one must assume, instead, that there has been acceleration of the decay rate in the past. Using this revised assumption, the same uranium-lead data can now be interpreted to also give an age of fewer than 6,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using their Biblical presupposition, they need to explain away the evidence of the accumulation of radioactive decay products by assuming that decay rates were roughly &lt;i&gt;one million fold greater&lt;/i&gt; in the recent past. They are making a "revised assumption" that would mean that the planet should have exploded into a great glowing cloud of hot vapor a few thousand years ago! Shouldn't that sort of compel you to rethink your excuses? But no, these guys just sail past the glaring contradiction with empirical reality as if it didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's a good reason creationism is not regarded as a fair equivalent to the scientific point of view. It's because the former fails to pay attention to the physical evidence, while the latter is built, not on presuppositions, but on that evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/false_equivalence.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/497879135" height="1" width="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230568843915"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=958">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb2a5eb7b6c27e8c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Peeving"/><category term="prepositions"/><title type="html">Grouch v.

Although the real problem seems to have been the difficulty of arranging for voice mail to be turned on, he focused on a linguistic irritant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;… finally, after pressing a number of zeros, I was rewarded with the  voice of a live person who said, “With whom do I have the pleasure of  speaking with?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;After some frustrating back-and-forth caused by the fact that AT&amp;amp;T&amp;#39;s business systems are apparently not well set up to deal with people who are wealthy enough to have multiple residences, but not wealthy enough to keep the phone service going in all of them at all times, Prof. Fish returned to the annoyingly redundant preposition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I should have quit when I was (somewhat) ahead, but I couldn’t resist returning to the greeting, with its double and ungrammatical “with.” I explained that the second “with” was superfluous, as the second “to” would be if the offending question had been, “to whom am I speaking to?”, or the second “about” if the question had been “about what are you worrying about?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Somehow that didn’t make much of an impression on her. She said that her instructions were to greet callers in that way and that she would continue to do so. I replied that it was scandalous that a multi-billion-dollar world-wide telecommunication corporation would order its employees to commit an egregious (and comical) grammatical error millions of times a day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;She said, “I’m sorry you feel that way.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I lost it. &lt;em&gt;It has nothing to do with feelings, I ranted. It is a factual matter as to what is and is not syntactically correct.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you who have ever worked in a service industry will not be surprised to learn that the rest of Prof. Fish&amp;#39;s interaction with multiple levels of AT&amp;amp;T call-center personnel went badly, and in the end his voice mail was not turned on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those of you who share our attitude towards linguistic oddities ("We don't complain, we explain") may want to read about the redundant-preposition trend in a series of earlier LL posts: "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004510.html"&gt;Re-doubled prepositions&lt;/a&gt;", 5/19/2007,  "&lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004464.html"&gt;A note of dignity or austerity&lt;/a&gt;" (5/3/2007), "&lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004465.html"&gt;Back to the future, redundant preposition department&lt;/a&gt;" (5/4/2007), "&lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004493.html"&gt;A phenomenon in which I'm starting to believe in&lt;/a&gt;" (5/14/2007), "&lt;a href="http://158.130.17.5/%7Emyl/languagelog/archives/004498.html"&gt;Could preposition doubling be headed our way?&lt;/a&gt;" (5/15/2007).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[By the way, I doubt that AT&amp;amp;T actually requires its operators to ask “With whom do I have the pleasure of  speaking with?” My guess would be that that some call center may recommend &amp;quot;With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?&amp;quot;, and an individual employee, puzzled by having to deal with the obsolete morpheme &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;whom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — and perhaps affected by the other forces contributing to the redundant-preposition phenomenon — added the extra &amp;quot;with&amp;quot;. But I might well be wrong — if anyone knows the facts of this case, please tell us in the comments. ]&lt;/p&gt;

Not that it will matter, proponents of such fantasy solutions will just close their eyes and pray harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teens who take virginity pledges are just as likely to have sex as teens who don't make such promises -- and they're less likely to practice safe sex to prevent disease or pregnancy, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what might work? Maybe the fans of abstinence only sex ed ought to distribute this study by Rosenbaum far and wide. It&amp;#39;s saying that the people who make virginity pledges are more likely to be dangerously diseased or fertile, which might discourage a few randy young men. &amp;quot;Oh, you&amp;#39;ve sworn to be abstinent? I won&amp;#39;t try to dissuade you…and excuse me, I have to go wash my hands and take a bath in disinfectant.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more results from this study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teens who had taken a pledge had 0.1 fewer sex partners during the past year, but the same number of partners overall as those who had not pledged. And pledgers started having sex at the same age as non-pledgers, Rosenbaum found.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The study also found that teens who took a virginity pledge were 10 percent less likely to use a condom and less likely to use any other form of birth control than their non-pledging counterparts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Sex education programs for teens who take pledges tend to be very negative and inaccurate about condom and birth control information," Rosenbaum said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The study also found that, five years after taking a virginity pledge, more than 80 percent of pledgers denied ever making such a promise. "This high rate of disaffiliation may imply that nearly all virginity pledgers view pledges as nonbinding," Rosenbaum said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed, this one's been floating around in the back of my mind for a long time. Perhaps one reason is that it's hard for a surgeon to write about this topic without coming off sounding like an old fart, a curmudgeon, unhappy about change and thinking that a system that was good enough for me must sure as hell be good enough for the current generation of residents. In fact, even after seeing an article that normally would have spurred me to write about this topic more than two weeks ago, I stored it in my folder of bloggable links and forgot about it. But sitting in front of my computer last night, I thought back to my residency and how different it was compared to residency now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article appeared in Salon.com a couple of weeks ago and was entitled &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2206367"&gt;Halt the Surgery--It's Time for My Nap: The downside of requiring young doctors to get more sleep&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Much to the delight of harried young doctors everywhere, an expert panel recently agreed that medical residents aren't getting enough sleep. Citing evidence that fatigue leads to more medical errors, the Institute of Medicine said last week that doctors in training should not work more than 16 hours without taking a five-hour nap. Though it carries no binding authority, the recommendation of the IOM's report supplements an earlier rule, passed by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 2003, that limited residents to 30-hour shifts and no more than 80 hours of work each week. Surgical residents may someday soon have to prepare themselves to halt an operation and announce that it's nap time.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/limiting_physician_trainees_work_hours_a.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/limiting_physician_trainees_work_hours_a.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/497787938" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230566220617"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4980">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2aa4d2268265f613</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Random Asides"/><category term="christmas"/><category term="cooking"/><category term="turkey"/><title type="html">TurkeyFAIL</title><published>2008-12-29T15:32:51Z</published><updated>2008-12-29T15:32:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4980" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4af58566587f868164f2085bcbfe08d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most households in the UK, the women do the majority of the housework and cooking, regardless of whether they have a job too. This doesn’t mean we actually work more, &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6571375.stm"&gt;at least according to this 2007 survey&lt;/a&gt;, apparently men work as hard but concentrate their efforts at the office, where women slack off in their careers but power around the house with a duster and iron. I think this might be what I like to call ‘crap’ but who can doubt a slightly-dated self-report survey? Not me, and the survey, which I only went to find because I am cross about the turkeyFAIL, isn’t even my point - my point is that I did all of the cooking on Christmas Day (the survey is right then!!) and because I am not used to the stupid over-hot oven, my turkey was incinerated. I took it out of the oven to turn it over and the entire thing, enough for 16 people, completely collapsed. It was like santa had landed on it, or as though Israel had decided to get some target practice in on my festive bird. It was as if the turkey had discovered the concept of ‘explosion’ at the exact same moment as ‘implosion’ and decided to try them both out simultaneously. I didn’t have the heart to take a photo but I did want to post this little lament for everyone who did the cooking on Christmas Day. If your turkey was perfect, congratulations. If not, I feel slightly better already.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>tkingdoll</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230564693373"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=448">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/908d5df0e2180ca8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">Alternative Medicine - Reply to Comments</title><published>2008-12-29T15:00:57Z</published><updated>2008-12-29T15:00:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=448" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following is a response to many comments left on the Skeptic Blog in reply to my previous post on the skeptical battleground of so-called &lt;a href="http://skepticblog.org/2008/12/15/skeptical-battlegrounds-part-iii-alternative-medicine/"&gt;alternative medicine&lt;/a&gt;. There are too many comments for me to reply to individually, so I will answer all the main points raised here. Many of the usual points on the pro-CAM side were raised, and even though I have gone over all of them before on NeuroLogica and Science-Based medicine, it is worth reviewing them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctors are bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the comments made the basic point that the popularity of CAM is the fault of evil, uncaring, incompetent or dangerous doctors. These comments took one of two forms - using negative claims about doctors and medicine to explain why CAM is popular, and using them to justify CAM. These are similar but distinct claims. The latter claim, that CAM is legitimate because scientific medicine “doesn’t have all the answers” or is uncaring or corrupt, is a non sequitur. The position of CAM critics like myself is that CAM treatments are unscientific, not proven, and often already proven to be unsafe or ineffective. There should be a single science-based standard of care for all medicine - not a double standard where fraud and unscientific claims can flourish. If we are currently not doing an adequate job enforcing the standard of care that is not a justification for abandoning it - it just means we need to figure out how to do a better job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim that people are attracted to CAM because of the failings of scientific medicine seems to be the default assumption on the part of CAM apologists, but there is little evidence to support this claim. In fact what few &lt;a href="http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=103624738.html"&gt;surveys that have been done&lt;/a&gt; show that dissatisfaction with scientific medicine is a minor factor in using CAM. Users site the desire to feel as if they have control over their health care and philosophical reasons for their choice of CAM. Also, 85% of CAM users continue to use scientific medicine and use CAM only to “complement” their health care. They are not choosing CAM instead of mainstream medicine - they just want to explore all their options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So motivations for CAM use are more complex than the simple-minded propaganda of  “doctors are bad.” But there is a kernel of truth to this claim. It is true that the experience of mainstream medicine can often be cold and complex. The current ethical standards of informed consent mean that doctors are obligated to tell patients the unpleasant truth. Tests are often unpleasant to endure also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, managed care has put tremendous pressure on the health care system and as a result office visits are generaly shorter than they have been in the past. The bottom line is this - the system is paying for less medicine (especially for E&amp;amp;M - evaluation and management), so patients are getting less medicine. Many older physicians in the 1990’s simply retired, because they literally could not afford to keep their practice open. For medical practice not based on procedures revenue is down by about 60% over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if patients are willing to pay out-of-pocket then they can get as much time as they want with their physicians. This is the model of so-called boutique clinics, or some spciality clinics. It is also the model of most CAM providers, not by coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that the answer to the challenges of the overwhelming costs and subsequent compromises of modern medicine is not to abandon the scientific standard of care. Again - that is a dangerous non sequitur. In fact, CAM just worsens the problem by diverting funds away from standard medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I acknowledge that CAM practitioners have largely mastered the psychological aspects of a positive therapeutic relationship. Those are the selective pressures they have been under - to tell their clients what they want to hear. They are not constrained by science, by informed consent - in short, by the truth. They are free to give a simple explanation for every client that walks through their door, to claim that they have the answer for everything, and to design their treatments to be pleasant rather than effective. Being disconnected from science and ethics can be very liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some specific claims made that I want to address. Tracy wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with EBM is it takes too long and doesn’t take the human cost of its long delays, or the format of its trials, into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current regulatory setup is incredibly slow and somewhat unethical. Its unethical to give dying people placebos in trials, yet its what has to be done right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is both misleading and a logical fallacy. It is another form of the argument from final consequences - people need treatments, therefore they should get them. But what if no such treatment exists? Does that mean it is ethical to make up a fake treatment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statements are also false. The delay of doing clinical trials is definitely taken into account. It is even possible to get experimental treatments on a compassionate basis for terminal illnesses. Researchers and ethicists have actually spent decades being quite thoughtful on all these issues. Also - it is unethical to withold a proven treatment from someone to put them in a trial - so no one gets a placebo instead of a proven treatment. Preliminary open (no placebo) trials are often done before placebo-controlled trials, and if a treatment were dramatically effective it would be fast-tracked. When possible the placebo arm is limited to 1/3 of study patients so that the chance of getting a placebo is minimzed. Also, trials are monitored so that if a treatment is proven adequately to work before the trial is scheduled to conclude it can e stopped early so that that the treatment can be made available right away. In other words - every effort is made to get effective treatments to dying or suffering patients as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Tracy’s type of comments are common - people who don’t have any actual experience in medicine or clinical research base their conclusions on assumptions and second-hand information, or perhaps what they see on tv. But they have no relationship to the actual ethical standard in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula made a similar point when she wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people do not have satisfactory solutions to their ailments from traditional medicine, what would you skeptics propose they do? Just sit around and die?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not. Take any reasonable action. The more desperate one’s situation, the greater the justification for speculative and risky treatments. But this is already incorporated into the ethics and practice of scientific medicine. There is a line, however - do not abandon all science and reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a hidden assumption in Paula’s point - that short of a cure there is nothing to do but go home and die. This is almost never the case. When a terminal disease cannot be cured there is often a great deal we can still do to maximize the duration and quality of life. It is far better to focus your efforts on that - get the most out of the time you have left -then to spend your remaining days spending your family’s money searching for a cure that does not exist. I have seen patients spend tens of thousands of dollars on unsafe and unpleasant treatments outside the country, grasping for a sliver of hope that turned out to be a false hope. They typically greatly regret the experience. It is like hitting a drowning man over the head with a sledgehammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some blamed the popularity of CAM on the for-profit nature of “corporate” medicine. This is certainly part of the anti-medicine propaganda. Also, as is commonly the case, there is a kernel of truth. Conflicts of interest are a problem - but they are recognized and are largely being delt with. Contrary to one commenters claims - doctors do not get “kickbacks” from pharmaceutical companies. Kickbacks are illegal. Large gifts from pharmaceutical reps for listening to their sales pitches have mostly already been weeded out. Small gifts are on the wane also - mainly due to internal criticism by doctors who feel it taints our reputation with the appearance of conflict. They probably have a point. But, to be clear, medical decision making is largely driven by the standard of care - not financial conflicts of interest. Actually, the biggest conflict probably comes from managed care, which provided a huge incentive not to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tangential issue - but it is impossible to design an incentive-neutral system. Whoever pays for health care will be motivated to minimize it, and whoever profits will be motivated to maximize it. You can shift the incentives around, but you cannot eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, let’s remember that the whole argument is the fallacy of inconsistency. CAM is largely a for-profit cottage industry. They are just good at attacking their competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctors kill patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several commenters brought up the fact that many patients die from either medical mistakes or adverse drug reactions. David Paterson specifically concludes that patients would have a better outcome going to a witch doctor than a medical doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument, however, is based entirely on a fallacy - considering only the risks and not the benefits. Dr. Harriet Hall wrote an &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=136"&gt;excellent recent post &lt;/a&gt;on one of the studies David cited, making that same basic point. First, the numbers cited are likely greatly exagerated, but that is a side point I don’t have time to go into today. Even if we take them at face value - the point is that medical decision-making is all about risk vs benefit. In order for any treatment to be considered ethical and part of the standard of care it must demonstrate benefit in excess of risk. Standard of care also includes giving informed consent regarding the calculation of risk vs benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials are designed to look at the net effects of a treatment - if the only variable is the use of a specific treatment vs a placebo, what are the final outcomes for the patients?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, my primary criticism of CAM is that they generally have not gone through this analysis. Most CAM modalities (I know I am lumping here, but remember I am against the CAM category - every treatment needs to be considered individually, but I am responding to the CAM proponents) have no proven benefit or have not demonstrated benefit in excess of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore absurd to criticize scientific medicine in favor of CAM over the issue of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of risk management is medicine is a legitimate and serious issue. But there already exists mechanisms within mainstream medicine to address the problem of mistakes and failures to meet the standard of care. A great deal of progress has already been made, but we do need to do much better still. The answer largely is in putting into place redundant systems that minimize error. This is increasingly necessary as the practice of medicine becomes more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if all you are doing is waving your hands over a patient there is not much that can go wrong - but there isn’t much that can go right, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAM is preventive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the commenters made the point that CAM focuses more on prevention. This is simply not true. All of the real effective preventive health measures, like diet and exercise, were discovered (and continue to progress) through scientific medicine. Primary care doctors routinely advise patients to quit smoking, lose weight, eat a healthier diet, etc. Blood pressure is often managed by reducing salt, high cholesterol by dietary changes, and diabetes by going on a diabetic diet and exercising regularly. Aspirin is routinely prescribed to prevent heart attacks and strokes. In my own practice I advice withdrawal of dietary triggers (like caffeine) or hydration to manage migraines, change in “sleep hygiene” to manage sleep problems, and stretching, exercise, gentle massage and moist heat to manage back pain. I routinely check certain vitamin levels and prescribe supplements as needed. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is simply absurd to argue that doctors do not emphasize life-style changes or prevention. These have already been built into the standard of care. Such interventions are also often the low-hanging fruit - that’s where we start because it is easy and low risk. Medical management is used when the lifestyle changes are not enough, and invasive options, like surgery, are a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly - we question what we do, we conduct research to find out what the best options are, and we change what we do based upon that evidence. CAM practitioners do not change what they do in response to scientific evidence. They certainly have never abandoned a worthless modality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we do better? Of course. That will always be true. But we are doing better. Simply taking a snap shot of the current state of medicine and arguing that any deficiencies warrant abandoning science as the standard of medicine is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I did not get to every point. I could have written a dozen articles this length addressing every side point raised in the comments. But I hit the highlights - the points that are most commonly raised. I don’t expect this entry will end any debate. This is too complex and emotional an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to emphasize my central theme. Most of the comments were distractions from the central issue - the public is best served by medical practices that are safe and effective. The best way to maximize safety and effectiveness of medicine is through a standard of care based upon the best science available. Magic and false hope are no substitute.&lt;/p&gt;

It consists of many short slices of ideas, including this one about homeopathy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONE OF THE PRINCIPLES of homeopathic medicine is that a smaller dose is considered more effective than a larger dose. This has profound implications for U.S. foreign policy. At the moment, we have 158,000 troops in Iraq. Imagine if we had only six! According to homeopathic logic, this presence would be much more successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/blmurch/2754681293/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/glass_of_water.jpg" alt="Glass of water from blmurch’s Flickr stream"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sentiment is certainly no more silly than any others that meet the standards, such as they are, of homeopathology. Homeopathy is perhaps the most ridiculous of all quackery, since it says that the best medicine is medicine that is entirely gone. In theory it hardly needs debunking; it’s a cul-de-sac of reason, Poe’s Law incarnate. It’s the solipsism of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many people believe in it, so in practice &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=264"&gt;it does need debunking&lt;/a&gt;. In a typical essay showing all the myriad ways homeopathy goes wrong, the usual suspects are displayed: the theory behind it doesn’t make sense, water doesn’t have memory, diluting medicine actually makes it weaker, and all that. But you don’t need to go into all that detail. Why not? Because homeopathy is self-denying! Just look at it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If homeopathy works, then obviously the less you use it, the stronger it gets. So the best way to apply homeopathy is to not use it at all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quod erat demonstrandum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, homeopaths tend to be immune to logic and reason (ironically, proving homeopathy at least in principle: the less likely you are to ask for scientific evidence to support it, the stronger homeopathological evidence gets). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we need a practical application, a way to stop homeopathy practitioners cold. And I think I have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The next time you meet one, ask them what they do when they get thirsty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they really believe homeopathy, then within days all the homeopaths will be gone, deceased due to diligently dogmatic dehydration. And the beauty of it? According to their own logic, once all the homeopaths are gone, &lt;em&gt;they will have reached maximum strength.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They win, we win, medicine wins, logic wins. Everyone wins. Well, technically, they &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; win, being dead and all. But they made their point! I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, spread the word! And if you’re a homeopath, then &lt;em&gt;it’s your duty&lt;/em&gt; to link to this very blog post: according to your own tenets, the more it gets out there, the weaker it is! So submit it to Digg, submit it to Fark, put it on Slashdot, and Boing Boing, and Neatorama. Get millions of people to visit this page. It’s the only way to stop skepticism!&lt;/p&gt;

Since I'm not likely to have time to write while I'm away, I'm taking the opportunity to re-run some old classic posts which were first posted in the summer of 2006. These posts are mildly revised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Back when I first wrote this post, I was taking a break from some puzzling debugging.
Since I was already a bit frazzled, and I felt like I needed some comic relief, I decided to
hit one of my favorite comedy sites, Answers in Genesis. I can pretty much always find
something sufficiently stupid to amuse me on their site. On that fateful day, I came across a
gem called &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v10/i2/information.asp"&gt;Information, science and biology"&lt;/a&gt;, by the all too appropriately named
"Werner Gitt". It's yet another attempt by a creationist twit to find some way to use
information theory to prove that life must have been created by god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This article really interested me in the bad-math way, because I'm a big fan of information theory. I don't pretend to be anything close to an expert in it, but I'm
fascinated by it. I've read several texts on it, taken one course in grad school, and had the incredible good fortune of getting to know Greg Chaitin, one of the co-inventors of algorithmic information theory. Basically, it's safe to say that I know enough about
information theory to get myself into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Unlike admission above, it looks like the Gitt hasn't actually &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; any real
information theory much less understood it. All that he's done is heard Dembski presenting
one of his wretched mischaracterizations, and then regurgitated and expanded upon them.
Dembski was bad enough; building on an incomplete understanding of Dembski's misrepresentations, misunderstandings, and outright and errors produces a result
that is just astonishingly ridiculous. It's actually a splendid example of my mantra on this blog: "&lt;em&gt;the worst math is no math&lt;/em&gt;"; the entire article pretends to be doing math - but it's actual mathematical content is nil. Still, to the day of this repost, I continue
to see references to this article as "Gitt's math" or "Gitt's proof".&lt;/p&gt;

You can go ahead and chose whatever descriptor of “The Worst” that you see fit, such as the worst enemy of science, or the worst master of hyperbole. No person of greater “celebrity” went so far in 2008 for the promotion of anti-science as Ben did with his film “Expelled”. And for those of us that continued to pay attention to Ben in the weeks and months after his film crashed and burned by all measures, the cherry-on-the-top was his now infamous quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [biologist P.Z. Myers], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed … that was horrifying beyond words, and that’s where science — in my opinion, this is just an opinion — that’s where science leads you … Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a disgraceful statement, made by an equally disgraceful human being. To invoke and twist the facts and history of The Holocaust as a means to prop up his baseless, biased arguments is sickening. Steven Novella summed it up perfectly in four words in the title of his May 15, 2008 Neurologica blog entry: &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=294"&gt;Ben Stein hates science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for all of his hard efforts this year, Ben Stein gets my vote as “The Worst” for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, mainstream press coverage of autism spectrum disorders improved in 2008, as more major media outlets bravely recognized that deadly childhood diseases are a bad thing, and it is a good thing when we can prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But news coverage was also marked by some serious developmental regression, and a strong correlation between anti-vaccine talking points and poor sourcing of alleged facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="width:145px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mcpihome.com/images/steve_wilson.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.mcpihome.com/images/steve_wilson.jpg" alt="Wilson" width="135" height="133"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;WXYZ&amp;#39;s Wilson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the category of &lt;em&gt;Most Uncritical Repetition of Urban Myths by a Local News Celebrity&lt;/em&gt;, the award goes to Steve Wilson of WXYZ in Detroit, for &lt;a href="http://www.wxyz.com/content/news/investigators/story/Wilson-Some-Vaccines-Still-Contain-Mercury/2qKdWV73REiVLhJB8ztX_Q.cspx"&gt;Some Vaccines Still Contain Mercury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s tough to beat Wilson for sheer tenacity as he packs 16 false and misleading claims into the story’s 7 minutes, for a nonsense/minute ratio of 2.3. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amish “generally shun” vaccines, and autism is rare in their population&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven scheduled pediatric vaccines still contain as much thimerosal as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd Haley is a leading vaccine researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feds conceded that vaccines caused autism in Hannah Poling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Wilson failed to mention&lt;/em&gt;: No respected medical body or government institution has ever found a connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Canadian college student majoring in chemistry built himself a home lab - and discovered that trying to do science in your own home quickly leads to accusations of drug-making and terrorism.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lewis Casey, an 18-year-old in Saskatchewan, had built a small chemistry lab in his family's garage near the university where he studies. Then two weeks ago, police arrived at his home with a search warrant and based on a quick survey of his lab determined that it was a meth lab. They pulled Casey out of the shower to interrogate him, and then arrested him.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A few days later, police admitted that Casey's chemistry lab wasn't a meth lab - but they kept him in jail, claiming that he had some of the materials necessary to produce explosives. Friends and neighbors wrote dozens of letters to the court, testifying that Casey was innocent and merely a student who is really enthusiastic about chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Errm, having the &amp;quot;materials necessary to produce explosives&amp;quot; is an awfully low bar to set. If we&amp;#39;re going to go that route, let&amp;#39;s round up and arrest all the farmers — they&amp;#39;ve got fuel oil and fertilizer in bulk, and are a far more serious danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't criminalize reagents. Monitor them, sure, but instead target the products of criminal chemistry. Anything else is going to have lots of false positives and is going to damage science education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/when_they_criminalize_chemistr.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/497369339" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230509986991"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-457446088835826862">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a6082d87c4180ee8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">How NOT to Argue Against Me: A Critique of Shandon L.

But if you think dealing with a summary of a book is the same thing as dealing with the arguments in it, then think again. One professor did this with my previous book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Why-Became-Atheist-Preacher-Christianity/dp/1591025923?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;link_code=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969"&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwdebunkingc-20&amp;amp;l=btl&amp;amp;camp=213689&amp;amp;creative=392969&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1591025923" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important;padding:0px!important"&gt; and this is how I responded:&lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A philosophy professor at Regis University named Shandon L. Guthrie &lt;a href="http://www.mychurch.org/blog/355060/Question-of-the-Week-Is-John-Loftus-Case-Against-Christianity-a-Good-One#comment"&gt;took issue recently&lt;/a&gt; with a summary of my case against Christianity. I like to hear from intelligent, educated Christians, and I appreciate him looking into it. But here is an example of how NOT to argue against me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He begins by saying this:&lt;blockquote&gt;It may not be of much surprise, but I'm not terribly moved by his arguments.  Most importantly, the case he summarizes is neither new nor particularly challenging. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, well. If a summary of my case is not challenging to him then so be it. I am more confident that Guthrie has not come up with anything to challenge what I think either. I could describe his case as neither new nor particularly challenging to me as well. So where does that get us? Christians repeatedly say such things but I don’t see how they’ve sufficiently answered people like David Hume, even though they have repeatedly attempted it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to Guthrie’s criticisms of my arguments keep in mind he’s not actually dealing with my case. He’s criticizing a mere summary of my case. And THAT makes all the difference in the world. I tire of people who criticize my summary who in turn think they have actually dealt with my arguments. If someone truly wants to deal with my arguments then he should read through the 428 pages &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-i-became-atheist.html"&gt;of my book&lt;/a&gt;. A summary is, after all, a summary. I defend that summary in my book. And because it is just a summary Guthrie has not read how I deal with his criticisms. In my book I deal with and argue against each and every claim of his. That being the case I don’t have to do so here, but I'll comment on some of what he said.&lt;blockquote&gt;Loftus' key argument is found in his statement that "an individual's religion is almost invariably determined by 'when and where one was born.' And since there are no mutually agreed upon tests for evaluating religious claims, it is little wonder that social, cultural, and political forces overwhelmingly determine what individuals believe."  But it doesn't follow that simply because individuals derive their beliefs from their cultural milieu that, therefore, those beliefs are false.  This is the genetic fallacy.  It no more invalidates the belief any more than it invalidates the conclusion that infanticide is wrong even though certain Eskimo cultures embraced it as a normal practice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The genetic fallacy? Come on now, does he really think I didn’t deal with this criticism? The &lt;em&gt;Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/em&gt; does not, and I repeat, does not commit that fallacy. It does not show his beliefs are false simply because of how he came to believe in them. It merely attempts to show that someone should treat his own religious beliefs just as he treats the beliefs of others, from an outsider perspective. There is nothing circular or self-defeating about it either. In my book I deal with all of these types of criticisms.&lt;blockquote&gt;Philosophical Reason 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loftus presents three disjunctive claims about the origin of the universe - one of which is necessary to believe: &lt;br&gt;Something has always existed—always.&lt;br&gt;Something popped into existence out of absolutely nothing.&lt;br&gt;Our existence in the universe is absurd to the core.&lt;br&gt;He opts for accepting either #1 or #2 here because since we enter into epistemology from an agnostic position then "moving from agnosticism to atheism is a much smaller step than moving toward full-blown Christianity" and Christianity "entails a greater number of claims and thus is inherently more difficult to defend."  But this is multiply flawed.  First, as I've noted in my own work, the cosmological evidence at worst rules out atheism.  Loftus himself even says, "I might happily concede deism"!&lt;/blockquote&gt;If Guthrie had read my book he would know that there is a huge chasm between deism and Christianity. A believer cannot get to Christianity from a God who merely had the power to start a quantum wave fluctuation. If Guthrie had read my book he should also know there is a huge difference between denying a set beliefs and affirming a different set of beliefs. The denial is the easy part. We all do it. We easily deny Islam, Hinduism or Mormonism. But when it comes to affirming a set of beliefs Guthrie is probably as confident in what he affirms as he is in what he denies. I am not. I can best be described as an agnostic atheist. I think there isn’t a God of any kind, but I’m not sure of that.&lt;blockquote&gt;Secondly, even if it were true that the case for Christianity is more complicated it doesn't follow that one ought to adopt atheism because its pathway is simpler.&lt;/blockquote&gt;To the contrary, the more beliefs a person has that are essential to his worldview then the less likely the whole set of beliefs comprising his worldview are true. He must maintain not only that there is a three-in-one God, but that the collection of books in the canonized Bible are all inspired by God, and that God became incarnated through a virgin in Bethlehem, atoned for our sins, resurrected from the grave, and will return, for starters. These beliefs, along with a multifaceted number of others, all stand or fall together. If one is shown wrong then his whole worldview collapses. By contrast, the only thing I affirm is that Christians like Guthrie have not made their case. My atheism is a position of last regard. I came to it by the process of elimination. I don’t think any believer in any religion has made his case. I don’t even have to make a case that there is no God, although that’s what I think.&lt;blockquote&gt;Philosophical Reason 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loftus also objects to Christianity on grounds that it is a double-standard in that they believe "the biblical miracles because they accept the Christian faith, but they are skeptical of the miracles of other religions." But he simply doesn't understand the probability calculus.  Yes, one must take into account the known accounts of miracles in the past - by everyone!  And Christian miracles do come out as largely improbable events when only their relative frequencies are assessed.  But this is not surprising to a Christian.  Instead, what Loftus would have to include in the background information is the fact that a traditional conception of God is true, that the particular evidence for a Christian miracle claim is better than not, and that any counter-hypothesis is not as likely given the evidence as the Christian conclusion.  In terms of the resurrection of Jesus, this is precisely what we find!&lt;/blockquote&gt;If Guthrie had read my book he'd know that I do indeed understand Bayesian probability calculus. And I deny his background knowledge for so many reasons I don’t even know where to start. I make a sustained and lengthy case against every one of the background beliefs which form the basis for him to believe in the miracle claims found in the Bible.&lt;blockquote&gt;Scientific Reason 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one is really bad in Loftus' arsenal.  He argues that since we employ a "methodological naturalism" in doing science and such science explains away some particular instances of supernaturalism, therefore Christianity is not likely true. Therefore, "how likely is it that a methodology that has worked so well in every other area of investigation would not shed light on the truth or falsehood of" Christian beliefs in general?  First, note that this is not a scientific claim to assert methodological naturalism, this is a philosophical claim about science. Secondly, the conclusion again doesn't follow from the premises.  Even if it's true that one ought to use this approach and that some events deemed supernatural can now be explained away naturally, it does not follow that Christian beliefs are not likely true.  Finally, at best, such naturalistic explanations opposing Christian ones begin from an equally problematic assumption - that there is no God.  So even if the evidence for a particular Christian claim suggests its truthfulness over naturalistic alternatives, the methodological naturalist has to jettison it and opt for a naturalistic alternative - no matter how fantastic the evidence for it might be!&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here I simply do not think Guthrie understands what methodological naturalism entails. It is not a philosophical commitment to naturalism. It is the method he himself uses to evaluate any noise in the night or any crime scene. He assumes a natural explanation. He does this every day of his life. No intelligent modern person assumes that a noise in the night comes from an angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe he should read Barbara Forrest's great essay titled, &lt;a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html"&gt;Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism: Clarifying the Connection&lt;/a&gt;, which I quote from in my book. She argues that &lt;blockquote&gt;...the relationship between methodological and philosophical naturalism, while not one of logical entailment, is the only reasonable metaphysical conclusion given (1) the demonstrated success of methodological naturalism, combined with (2) the massive amount of knowledge gained by it, (3) the lack of a method or epistemology for knowing the supernatural, and (4) the subsequent lack of evidence for the supernatural. The above factors together provide solid grounding for philosophical naturalism, while supernaturalism remains little more than a logical possibility.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Turning again to Guthrie he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Biblical Reason 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loftus argues that the biblical God is "clearly a hateful, racist, and sexist divinity." But even if he were right about those particular passages he cites to make his point, it only serves to show that perhaps the Bible is not inerrant, not that Christianity is not true.&lt;/blockquote&gt;My case is much more nuanced than that. My case is against the existence of the triune Christian God found in the Bible. Where does Guthrie propose we learn about his Christian God if it isn’t found the Bible? If he can pick and choose what he wants to believe from the Bible then he needs to specify the criteria for doing so. How does he determine what to believe in the Bible if he doesn’t believe it all? Until he does that I don’t have much more to say about this. &lt;blockquote&gt;Historical Reason 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loftus's basic contention here is that "[a]lmost anything can be rationally denied in history, even if the event happened" and, therefore, [implicitly] Christianity is not likely true.  This is yet another non-sequitur.  But more importantly Loftus fails to understand that Christianity's truth is not based on the evidence of history.  It's based on the realilty of God and His continuing presence.  The evidence merely gives probable support for what we already know and experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Does he think I didn’t deal with this objection? How does he know that it’s God he experiences? Billions of people claim religious experiences that have a different cognitive content.&lt;blockquote&gt;Historical Reason 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His complaint here can be summarized in his opening sentence, "The history of the Christian Church undermines the veracity of Christianity."  He cites the Inquisition, Crusades, Witch Hunts, etc. in making his point.  Can you say Joseph Stalin and Mao Tse-Tsung?  And contrary to popular belief, most wars are not fought in the name of religion but in the name of control.  In effect, they're carrying out the Nietzschian atheist's dictum that morality is the will to power!&lt;/blockquote&gt;How does this actually answer anything I say in my book?&lt;blockquote&gt;Empirical Reason&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprisingly, Loftus invokes the now-defunct deductive problem of evil.  He writes, "If God exists, the reality of intense suffering is a stubborn fact indicating that something is wrong with God's ability, goodness, or knowledge."  But, as I've argued elsewhere, if you're going to argue that the existence of an all-good, all-powerful God exists is logically contradictory to the existence evil in the world then you have to show why.  Loftus doesn't defend himself here. &lt;/blockquote&gt;My argument focuses on the inductive or evidential argument from evil. There are probably very few arguments showing something is logically impossible anyway, so that should not give Guthrie any comfort at all. If he demands that I show his God to be logically contradictory before he can see such a God is improbable then he needs to look again at what a non-sequitur is.&lt;blockquote&gt;Loftus concludes his essay explaining what it would take to convince him.  But all he's arguing for is an increase in an awareness of God in history.  But as he is so often fond of pointing out, atheism was not a problem in antiquity and yet overwhelmingly few people were part of the family of God.  How could Loftus guarantee that had the evidence been more abundant, then the amount of true believers would have increased more than what the actual world contains?  And I can't imagine how he could prove this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;See him asking here for proof…that I should prove this to be the case? This is such a high standard that it shows he has not thought through what he’s asking of me. When Christian apologists think they can continue to believe simply because we might not be able to prove their faith false they are asking way too much. I might as well say that there are green gremlins and tell Christians that I am within my epistemic rights to believe they exist until or unless such entities are proven to be logically contradictory. You see what they do? I’m dealing with probabilities, not proofs, plausibilites not impossibilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, if someone truly wants to engage me and my arguments keep in mind that a summary of a case is just a summary. It summarizes. That's what summaries are supposed to do. The arguments in defense of that summary are to be found in my book. Guthrie has not dealt with my arguments. What he has done is to provide us with an example of how NOT to argue against me. Guthire, I challenge you to actually deal with my arguments next time. No more straw men, okay? You are not helping your readers by not dealing with my arguments. It might make it seem like you have. But you haven't. Not by a long shot. Your readers deserve better than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just my opinion, though. Do as you wish, and I wish you the best. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Original post first published on Dec. 29, 2008&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/21219785-457446088835826862?l=debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com" alt=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We like the idea of working skeptical programming into an existing con structure, so we’ve been working with the folks from &lt;a href="http://www.convergence-con.org/"&gt;Convergence&lt;/a&gt;, the Minneapolis sci-fi con, and they’ve agreed to give us a skepticism track within the existing science track.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergence takes place July 2-6, 2009.  Most of us will be there, and we want as many of you as possible.  We’re working on getting some great guests to join us, too.  &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/"&gt;PZ Myers&lt;/a&gt; will be there, and more will be announced as they are confirmed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to lots of great panels and discussions, we’ll be hosting a Skepchick Pajama party, which I’m sure will include your favorite drinks from the now infamous &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=296447138"&gt;Skepchick Drink Contest&lt;/a&gt;, and will absolutely be far too much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don’t wait!  &lt;a href="http://www.convention-reg.com/?nav=event&amp;amp;event=cnvg09"&gt;Register&lt;/a&gt; now!  If you get in before the new year, it’s only $35 (okay, it’s $38.25 after the convenience fees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes peeled for more information as we get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>carr2d2</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230490212384"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4637697413373553380.post-2801011374416067099">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/650f89ca21818834</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="imagination" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="children" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Miracle on 34th Street - or Merry Xmas</title><published>2008-12-28T17:13:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-28T17:13:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://conspiracyfactory.blogspot.com/2008/12/miracle-on-34th-street-or-merry-xmas.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (The Factician)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://conspiracyfactory.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://conspiracyfactory.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">Conspiracy Factory</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://conspiracyfactory.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230482020426"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/28/ironic-onion/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23e3a074e5edd6c4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Ironic Onion</title><published>2008-12-28T16:21:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-28T16:21:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/28/ironic-onion/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Onion — still funny, even though it’s been around seemingly forever — just put up a great &amp;quot;radio&amp;quot; news bit: &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/radio_news/jesus_answers_half_the"&gt;&amp;quot;Jesus Answers Half The Prayers At Area Roulette Table&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (one NSFW word in that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, it’s dead-on satire by the Onion, with subtle skeptical layering in it. Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s also a bit ironic. You see, the newscaster says that Jesus answered exactly one half of the prayers at a roulette table, making black win to spurn those who bet on red. However, the odds of winning on black are less than half; there are two green (0 and 00) slots on the wheel too. So out of the 38 slots, only 18 are black and 18 red. The odds of winning on black are therefore 18/38 = 47.4%, giving the house a slight edge when you bet on red or black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me interpret the Onion ‘cast as saying that during the course of the night, Jesus granted exactly half the prayers, so after, say, 500 spins of the wheel black won half the time, and red the other half. What about green? Statistically speaking, green should win twice out of every 38 times, or 26 times over the night. The odds of not seeing green, not once, in 500 spins are very low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be evidence of one of two things: supernatural involvement, or the casino cheating. If the latter, well, too bad. If the former, and you can prove it, &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge/challenge-faq.html"&gt;then you can win a lot more than a single roulette bet…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;
&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, for those of you who are humor-impaired, yes I know that a) the Onion is satirical, and 2) the joke is that Jesus only answered the prayers of gamblers on a single bet. But I felt like writing about this topic, it encourages a little critical thinking, and educates people on the fine art of casino gambling. I’ll note that I am lifetime in the black myself for casino gambling by almost a hundred dollars, so that makes me an expert.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230481949286"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4967">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/15c5275d9d88e616</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Tim Minchin at 9 Carols for Godless People</title><published>2008-12-28T16:31:27Z</published><updated>2008-12-28T16:31:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4967" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an absolutely wonderful poem performed by Tim Minchin, recorded at 9 Carols for Godless People with absolutely horrific sound quality.

So when I saw on December 22 a message from our technical staff at the University of Edinburgh saying that on the following day the Unix servers would be taken down "for the installation of security patches and general maintenance", I naturally felt a chill like the coldness of the grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation of security patches, involving changes that could affect remote access, and "general maintenance", all to be completed five hours before a complete university Christmas shutdown?  Well, naturally (for I do basically take this sort of thing as completely normal now), since I left the office on December 22 there has been no access of any kind to the Unix server on which my life mainly depends: &lt;tt&gt;ping&lt;/tt&gt; (a program for probing remote machines to see if they are there) reports the machine as up and running, but secure shell connections do not go through (they do not even time out, they just hang), &lt;tt&gt;scp&lt;/tt&gt; copying hangs as well, and not even web pages will load (my home page is offline).  I need to find a way to inform everyone who has academic or administrative contact with me and is waiting for me to confirm things or send them things that I am incommunicado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People like Cherine Yu and Chu-Ren Huang in Hong Kong; Lars Hinrichs in Texas; Andrew Garrett in California; the LTTC people in Taiwan; Rodney Huddleston in Australia; Harry van der Hulst in Connecticut; Jeff Pelletier in Canada; Markku Filppula in Finland; Nick Enfield in Holland…  These people need to hear from me, and are probably emailing me — and email to the machine in question does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; trigger a bounce message.  Everyone will think I am just AWOL, or treating them rudely.  Of course, in principle, since I do have access to the rest of the web, I could just post a mayday message to them all here, and letting them know that they should communicate with my Gmail account instead (the account name is &lt;b&gt;pullum&lt;/b&gt;).  But that would be using a personal privileged access to pervert the whole purpose of Language Log, and it would be &lt;b&gt;wrong&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, nearly all such disasters with information technology eventually get (to some degree) fixed.  After a few days of desperate academics panicking and being unable to finish their conference papers for conferences between Christmas and New Year, hard-working technical staff do come in and reboot.  So it really should not surprise you too much that as soon as I had finished the above post, literally within seconds of finishing it, I saw one of our hard-working technical staff members walking past the door of my office in our almost-empty building.  And of course he had just fixed the problem in question.  After six days with our main server off the Internet, the moment I told you about it, the trouble was repaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nerds among you will want to know what had happened.  What could be the explanation for a machine that was up and running and connected to a functioning network but nonetheless unable to serve a web page or accept a login?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was that the "general maintenance" had included (in my heart I knew it) an upgrade of the Linux kernel.  And the new kernel ran for 36 hours or so, just to lull people into a spurious sense of confidence about it being all right.  Then on Christmas Eve, as soon as the last technical staff person had left the building and gone home for the holiday, it went into a state known as &lt;b&gt;kernel panic&lt;/b&gt;.  It is interesting (did you imagine there was never going to be a touch of linguistics in this post?) that we redeploy terminology relating to emotional and psychological states to obtain a vocabulary for unanticipated concepts like the behavior of the core of an operating system when it has begun to spend so much of its time in a desperate effort to maintain itself internally that it has no ability to perform its functions externally.  The operating system had gone into a state that is so reminiscent of neurotic crises and irrational panic attacks that the metaphor seems absolutely perfect — better than mechanical metaphors like &amp;quot;spinning its wheels&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a kernel panic, low-level systems (brain stem and subcortical activity, to continue the neuropsychological metaphoricity) are functioning, so &lt;tt&gt;ping&lt;/tt&gt; would get a positive response; but more elaborate operations, like running an http daemon to serve up web pages or starting up a login session in response to &lt;tt&gt;ssh&lt;/tt&gt;, cannot be accomplished.  (Why email was being received and filed I do not fully understand.  Perhaps that counts as low-level enough to be executed, or perhaps messages were being held in a queue on some other server en route.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard-working technical staff member who came in (thank you, Cedric!) knew how to roll the operating system back to use the version it had been using before December 23, and that got things back in order.  (As so often happens, it was necessary to downgrade in order to restore functionality.)  If psychiatrists knew how to do the same thing with human minds, psychiatry would be a science that could support engineering, and a lot of mental illness would be readily and easily curable.  But instead, psychiatry is in a state similar to that of linguistics: we know a fair bit, but so much fundamental knowledge is lacking that compared to many scientific subjects we are just groping in the dark.  As are, of course, the hard-working technical staff members who try to keep servers running through Christmas holidays…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update two days later: Aaron Davies, who objects to my remark about psychiatry-derived metaphors, has written to tell me a bit more about kernel panics.  I paraphrase what he wrote.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernel panics are generally due either to hardware problems or to memory access errors within kernel-space code like drivers — the same sort of errors that would make a user-space program deliver a segmentation fault.  The panic itself is a protection mechanism meant to ensure that a system fail completely rather than continue operating in an unknown state that may create security vulnerabilities, corrupt data, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The looping behavior that we call kernel panic is generated by a piece of code like the following (Aaron took this from kernel source code released as recently as last Wednesday):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;        for (i = 0;;) {&lt;br&gt;
                touch_softlockup_watchdog();&lt;br&gt;
                i += panic_blink(i);&lt;br&gt;
                mdelay(1);&lt;br&gt;
                i++;&lt;br&gt;
        }&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default implementation of &lt;tt&gt;panic_blink&lt;/tt&gt; just returns 0.  Before the loop starts, there's a page or so of other code that appears to turn off all multitasking and multiprocessing, guaranteeing that nothing else can be happening other than running this pointless piece of code.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what Aaron has told me.  I like to think of the behavior of a computer running the above loop as being rather like the behavior of a human who adopts a fetal position on the floor and mutters "We're all going to die!" over and over again.  But as Aaron points out, it is also very much like having your back wheels lifted off the ground (in a standard rear-wheel-drive vehicle) so that no matter how you accelerate you don't go anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Halbfinger of the New York Times. On 12/27/2008, the NYT published an 8,600-word &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/nyregion/28kennedytranscript.html?partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink"&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; of the interview, along with a conventional &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/nyregion/28kennedy.html?partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink"&gt;summary presentation&lt;/a&gt; whose online version  includes a sidebar with nine short audio clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheila at &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt;Snarker&lt;/span&gt; Gawker listened to the first audio clip, and asked "&lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5119062/how-many-times-can-caroline-kennedy-say-you-know-in-under-a-minute"&gt;How Many Times Can Caroline Kennedy Say 'You Know' in Under a Minute?&lt;/a&gt;" Sheila's answer was 12, and she remonstrated  that "We can't listen to two years of this! Caroline: every pause need not be filled with wordage, you know?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for me, the most interesting part of this story wasn't Caroline Kennedy's choice of pause fillers, but the New York Times' editorial policy with respect to audio clips from interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the background of the passage in question, according to the NYT transcript. David Halbfinger is trying to get Ms. Kennedy to say something controversial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;DH: Just to talk a little more about issues: a lot of your political positions seem pretty straight-up-the-middle, conventional for a Democrat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;CK: Does that surprise you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;DH: No. But I wonder, what are the biggest areas where you disagree with Democratic party orthodoxy? We want to know what sets you apart. You’ve cited a lot of examples and influences; what would be a subject that we would expect your position to be a real surprise on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Kennedy is sensibly unwilling to oblige him, and instead insists on her political orthodoxy, in an answer that lasts about 49 seconds — at least according to the audio clip on the NYT web site — and does pack in a dozen instances of &amp;quot;you know&amp;quot; as pause filler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there's a problem: according to the transcript, the audio clip was silently edited to remove two questions and an answer. This suprised me, despite  my years as a hardened and cynical observer of misleading quotation practices in the media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, there are also a few things in the clip that aren&amp;#39;t in the transcript — seven of the twelve instances of &amp;quot;you know&amp;quot;, along with a few instances of &amp;quot;uh&amp;quot;, a few false starts, and so on. This sort of clean-up is normal and hardly worthy of note.  Slightly more interesting is the transcript&amp;#39;s substitution of &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve had problems with NAFTA&amp;quot; for Kennedy&amp;#39;s mildly non-standard &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got problems with NAFTA&amp;quot;: this is a case where correcting a deprecated usage actually changes the meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the really problematic difference is in the other direction. The transcript includes two additional questions from Halbfinger, and one answer from Kennedy, which were apparently edited out of the audio clip, with no indication that this has been done. (I'm assuming, without any evidence, that the transcript itself is more or less correct and complete.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only mildly suprised, a few weeks ago, when I found ABC News peddling a fake video Q&amp;amp;A with President Bush, in which segments of his answers to two different questions were spliced together, out of order and out of context, with no indication that this surgery had been performed (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=886"&gt;In president, out president, fake president&lt;/a&gt;", 12/5/2008). Perhaps I should have been more indignant, but I've learned not to expect much in the way of journalistic ethics from broadcast news organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I accepted, years ago, that even first-rank newspapers like the New York Times &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002427.html"&gt;routinely fabricate virtual quotations in textual form&lt;/a&gt;, by splicing together out-of-context fragments from widely separated parts of an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  I'm still capable of being surprised that the NYT would present an audio clip that's been edited in this way. I guess that's because audio and video clips, like photographs, pretend to be a veridical portrayal of something that actually happened. So do passages in quotation marks, of course, which is why canons of journalistic ethics diverge so radically from actual journalistic practice in this area; but somehow tampering with an actual recording seems worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, there was no harm done, other than to journalistic standards. The editing in question didn't change the sense of Ms. Kennedy's answer much; it just made the clip shorter by taking out a back-and-forth that the reporter used to guide her answer in the direction he wanted her to take.  But  once you allow omission of context and silent ellipsis as valid editing techniques, you've opened the door to making anyone seem to say almost anything. (And you force savvy interviewees into trying to defend themselves by repeating their talking points no matter what you ask them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that editing techniques of this kind are routine in pre-recorded radio programs. A couple of years ago, I discussed an example from my own experience, which Ira Flatow (or his editors) created a completely fake debate in which I was one of the participants ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003102.html"&gt;Imaginary debates and stereotypical roles&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, 5/3/2006). I&amp;#39;m not naive enough to think that the producers of radio and TV shows are going to change their culture in significant ways at this point — though I think the public ought to be better informed about the relationship between what actually happened and what they see and hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do have  a couple of minimal suggestion for news organizations that aspire to a reputation for honesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need a form of audio-visual punctuation to correspond to the three dots that are used to indicate ellipsis in text. For example, we could echo the existing typographical convention by playing three short, soft tone-bursts, and (in the case of video) showing a third of a second of a blank screen with three dots. These symbols could be used whenever significant material has been edited out. A/V ellipsis could still be misused. But at least the existence of an edit would be signaled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And second, if a virtual monologue or dialogue has been created, by editing together out-of-context fragments, answers to different questions, etc., the clip should contain some sort of warning label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, now we get to the boring details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the Kennedy interview passage as given in the NYT transcript. Segments that are not in the audio clip (either because they were edited out of the audio, or interpolated in the transcript) are indicated in bold face:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;CK: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Well, I think that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; there’s a range of views in the Democratic party. And you know, I am a proud Democrat, those are the values, you know — middle class tax relief, helping working families, fixing the health care system — those are the national priorities right now. So those are the issues that I would expect — I mean, I am a Democrat, that is, you know — I am trying to become a Democratic senator, so I don’t, um — I mean, there are issues along the way, that I’m sure &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;that people&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; have differences of opinion. There’s controversies in all these areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;DH: One where you have a clear-eyed idea about where you stand on something that is diff —&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;CK: That is different from who? Anybody?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;DH: The party platform. I mean, pick some standard. Just something that would surprise —&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight:normal"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;CK: I support gay marriage, I support, you know, I’ve &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;had&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; problems with Nafta, I mean, I don’t — if we’re not comparing it to anybody specifically it’s hard to say where I’m going to disagree.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; NC: How about Governor Paterson?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CK: But I’m a traditional Democrat, so that’s what I want to fight for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;, those are the values I want to fight for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's my transcript of her answer as presented in the NYT's audio clip. Again, the segments that are missing from the transcript are in bold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;CK: There's a range of views in the Democratic party, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I'm-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; you know I am a proud democrat, those are the values &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;uh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; you know — middle class tax relief, you know, helping working families,   fixing the health care system, those are the national priorities right now. So &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;you know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; those are the issues that I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;you know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; would expect, and I mean &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; I am a Democrat, that is, you know, I&amp;#39;m- I&amp;#39;m trying to become a Democratic senator, so I don&amp;#39;t,   um  — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;you know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; I mean there are issues along the way &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;uh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; that I'm sure that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;you know 'cause we'll &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;have differences of opinion on them.  There's controversies in all these areas.  I support gay marriage, I support &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;um&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;you know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;uh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; you know I've &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;got&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; problems with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;you know&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt; NAFTA, I mean I don't- it's like if we're not comparing it to anybody specifically it's hard to say where I'm #((going to disagree))&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;NC: [interrupts] How about governor Paterson?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;CK: [continuing] But I'm a traditional democrat, so &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;you know &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;that's what I want to fight for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the audio clip as it appears on the NYT website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back at Gawker, Sheila took credit for the fact that the Times changed the headline (from "As a Candidate, Kennedy Is Eloquent but Elusive"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Oh look, they changed the headline to "Forceful But Elusive." Was it something we said? (PWNED!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more to say about Caroline Kennedy's choice of pause fillers, her relative degree of disfluency, etc.  One relevant bit of background is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howie_Carr_Show"&gt;Howie Carr Show&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s long-standing characterization of Senator Edward Kennedy as &amp;quot;the Wizard of Uhs&amp;quot; — an epithet that &lt;a href="http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008/08/the_wizard_of_u.html"&gt;some people have tried to transfer&lt;/a&gt; to Barack Obama.  For me, however, the context of the discussion isn&amp;#39;t so much the linguistic habits of particular individuals — though that&amp;#39;s worthy of study — but rather pack journalism and &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001554.html"&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not much of a football fan, at least not of professional football. These days, the games take even longer than a baseball game and all too often lack the excitement of even that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when it's the Detroit Lions playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, even though my interest in pro football is relatively weak, I do take in a game from time to time, and I still have a soft spot in my heart for my hometown team, despite their two decades of futility and never having gone to a Superbowl since the Superbowl was inaugurated. That's why I'm with my fellow Detroiters as described by &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081228/COL01/812280407/1049/SPORTS01"&gt;Mitch Albom&lt;/a&gt; this morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;That's what's left to brag about, Mr. Ford.

&lt;p&gt;We're the worst. We made history. We scraped bottom. Nobody does losing better than us. Those are boasts actually being hollered, Mr. Ford, because when your football team drops below bad, below terrible, below the talent, organization and performance level of every other team in the NFL, that's all that you have left to get excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect Awfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this afternoon -- as your 0-15 team gives it one last try on a wintry Lambeau Field in Green Bay -- you stand on the brink of being forever remembered as the captain of the Titanic, the commander of the Hindenburg, the man at the helm of the biggest crash in the history of professional football.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some Detroiters are rooting for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than just some. A lot--and rightfully so. I never thought this way before, but the Lions have--shall we say?--"inspired" me to say: If you suck, &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081228/COL22/812280429/1049/SPORTS01"&gt;suck the worst&lt;/a&gt;. Don't embrace mediocrity. No one remembers the mediocre, but they do remember the worst, and the Lions have their opportunity to suck the worst, to be the worst football team in NFL history. That infamy is the only thing for which they're likely to be remembered for a long time to come. They should stop struggling and embrace their suckitude. Certainly I'll be rooting for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0-16. Struggle no more. Make history. &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081228/SPORTS01/812280399/1049/SPORTS01"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be&lt;/em&gt; the worst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ADDENDUM:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20081228/SPORTS01/81228022"&gt;It's official&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Stats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2008 was a good year for the SGU. To review some statistics: Our first episode was recorded on 5/4/2005. By the end of 2005, we had several hundred listeners. We were not yet on iTunes, however (that’s how clueless we were). Early in 2006, we posted the SGU on iTunes and our listenership rapidly grew. We soon passed 1,000 listeners. That was a significant psychological milestone for us. I think at that point we all knew we would be doing this for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2006 we had reached 10,000 listeners. That year we were joined by Rebecca and affiliated with the JREF - both added to our growing numbers. In our wrap-up show for 2006, we predicted that we would reach 20,000 by the end of 2007. We passed 20,000 by June of 2007 and were just shy of 30,000 by the end of that year. In early 2007, we attended our first TAM and got to meet some of our listeners for the first time, which was a great deal of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the wrap up show for 2007, we predicted (these predictions being more an expression of hope than anything else) that we would reach 50,000 by the end of 2008. As of today, we have a weekly listenership of about 45,000 - a little shy of our goal. Our most downloaded episode, from 2/6/08, has over 61,000 downloads - more than 10,000 more than any other episode. I still have not been able to figure that one out (probably a link out there I am not aware of driving traffic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that there are several factors determining our numbers - how many people have iPods or other MP3 devices, how many of those people listen to podcasts, how many podcast listeners have an interest in non-fiction or specifically science content, and how many of them know of or listen to the SGU. I think the podcasting universe has been growing, and that has been responsible for much of SGU’s growth. Within that universe we have been successful in reaching our target audience, largely through iTunes, but with significant streams from other “word-of-internet” sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time we did level off a bit midway through 2008. We reached 40k listeners by June and then added only another 5k by this time. That is the first time that the rate of our growth in listeners decreased, leading us to believe that we finally hit our ceiling. I also think that as our listenership grows the amount of inevitable attrition increases, until we reach a steady-state with the rate at which we are adding new listeners. We seem to be close to that steady state, and perhaps the slower continued growth is mostly due to the continued expansion of the podcasting universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are ecstatic at the success of the SGU - it remains the most popular skeptical podcast and the highest ranked science podcast on iTunes from a source that is not already an established large media outlet (like National Geographic, Nova, or Scientific American) - we of course want to increase our numbers if we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that we seem to be peaking at about the same level as other major skeptical media sources. Both the Skeptical Inquirer and Skeptic magazine have similar numbers of readers as we have listeners. It could be that this is simply the size of the skeptical universe. I hope that is not the case - that we are hitting the glass ceiling of skepticism. The feedback we get from our listeners is that many of them are new to skepticism, and much younger than the traditional skeptical crowd. Although it is difficult to measure this, our feedback certainly made it seem as if we were growing the skeptical movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think this is true. Perhaps we are just replacing older magazine-reading skeptics with younger podcast-listening skeptics. If that’s true then that is great - we are contributing to the continuation of this vital movement by bringing in the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course we want to grow the movement - not just maintain steady state. How can we do this? Our goals are ambitious, and why shouldn’t they be? We have our sights set on breaking the 100k barrier - increasing our reach by an order of magnitude. Can this be done with a skeptical podcast? We aim to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are also not putting all our eggs into one basket. While it looks like the SGU will continue to be the centerpiece of our skeptical efforts for the forseeable future, we are experimenting with other media. Of course, blogs are a natural complement to podcasts, and I think we have maxed out our blogging efforts for the moment with the Rogues Gallery, NeuroLogica, Science-Based Medicine, Skeptic blog, Skepchick and the Long Run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also ventured into video - and like everyone soon discovered that video is a lot more work than audio. Still, we have only just begun in this arena. We have plenty of ideas and even volunteers (although we could always use more) and lack only for that most precious of resources - time. We have put out a number of well-received Youtube videos, and have more on the way. We also plan for some original video content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, hopes for the success of The Skeptologists is still alive and well. If we can break into mainstream TV that would definitely give an infusion to the entire skeptical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you are thinking at this point - “What can I do to help the SGU and the skeptical community?” Well, I’ll tell you. First and foremost - please help spread the word. Let your family, friends, co-workers, random people on the street, know about the SGU. MP3 devices loaded with the SGU and our companion podcast, 5×5, make great gifts. Link to us from your own site if you have one. If you come across any podcast or media aggregator and we are not already listed, send us an e-mail or just sign us up yourselves if you can. Leave us a kind review on iTunes. You know the drill. It really does matter, we are almost entirely driven by such efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give us helpful constructive feedback. Not only do we want to hear how we can make the show better, but what other kind of content you would find most useful. If you ever hear yourself thinking - “You know, the SGU should do X,” - well, write us and tell us about X. We may just do it. And keep sending in links to interesting news items and great questions. It really helps us find the best content for each show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a small non-profit organization and produce our content for free, in our spare time. We survive almost entirely on the generosity of our listeners. So we do appreciate any support you can give. You can make a &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/donations.asp"&gt;direct donation&lt;/a&gt;, download some of our &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/ecommerce/commerce.asp"&gt;premium content&lt;/a&gt; (which we see as a way to make a small donation to the SGU and get some bonus content as a thank you), or purchase some of &lt;a href="http://www.cafepress.com/skepticsguide"&gt;our swag&lt;/a&gt;. We use 100% of donations to run the NESS and SGU, run and attend live events, and produce content. The more resources we have, the more we will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank You!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it’s cliche, but I do honestly want to thank all of our listeners for making the SGU successful. It really would be nothing without the community of skeptics - leaving comments on our blogs, writing e-mails, taking part on the message boards, giving us feedback and donations, or just coming up to us to say hi at a live event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when the internet was just getting started. The techno-geeks were all saying that it would change the way we consume media - that media would become a two-way communication, not just passive one-way communication. Well, they were right. It took about a decade, but we are living today in the future they predicted. Each week, we feel as if we are having a conversation with the skeptical community - that means you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it’s a great community to be part of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230462311862"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=627">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b4a0f641aedf3c56</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Dialogue"/><title type="html">Arguing With Children Is Like Running In The Special Olympics….</title><published>2008-12-28T06:16:51Z</published><updated>2008-12-28T06:16:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=627" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was playing Rock Band with my cousins recently, two of whom have the misfortune of having a Rush fan for a parent, when 9 year-old Justin and I got in an argument.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: {laughs}
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him: Yes he is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: What do you know?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Him: I know he’s the best drummer ever.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok, name one other drummer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That turned out to be game, set, match. His older brother named one: “the drummer from Guns ‘N Roses”. &lt;/p&gt;

Well, that's a big load of crap, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2008/12/on_motherhood_and_maintaining.php"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/isisthescientist/2008/12/ask_dr_isis_1.php"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; by Isis show why.  It is impossible to separate politics from science from personal life, at least on one level.  Now, perhaps I've become more conservative with age (although I doubt it), but certain parts of the discussion really disturbed me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rhetoric turned to some classical 70s-80s feminist themes, which can be rather useful, but as with most ideologies, trying to hard to cram all the facts into the theoretical framework leaves neither undamaged.  Of course, I'm writing as a male who has experienced many of the benefits of the so-called patriarchy, but folks, it just ain't that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all need to keep &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2008/12/you_say_you_want_a_revolution.php"&gt;utopian ideas&lt;/a&gt; in mind.  It give us hope, something to strive for.  But in our real world, there will be no revolution, no turning-on-its-head of our society and its norms---and that's a good thing, as dramatic revolutions never seem to work out quite the way they are intended.  Change---change that is acceptable to individuals, and not forced upon them in re-education camps---comes incrementally.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you the first thing that made me nauseated (from Isis):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A prominent scientist] was visiting the MRU I was attending to give a seminar and I heard it casually mentioned that she had four children.  After her talk I had the opportunity to attend a group lunch with her and during a lull in the conversation I asked how she managed to raise four children while managing a large lab and holding down a slew of research funding.  She told me quite abruptly that her children and her work were separate entities.  She keeps no pictures of her children in her office and does not display their artwork.  She told me that she does not want people to walk into her office and immediately identify her by her family instead of her science. 

&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later I met a very prominent female physiologist at a seminar, except this time I was about 12 weeks pregnant.  Again, it was mentioned that she had children and during a group meal  I brought up the issue of raising children as a scientist.  She told me that the only way her career worked was because she was able to send her children to live with her parents during the school year.  I was devastated and seriously doubted my decision to become a mother or continue as an academic scientist.  Then again, I had already sealed the deal, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a crappy role model.  This is the real world, and in the real world every family, every individual is different.  Financial needs often determine which parent is staying home more, and this is not just the influence of patriarchy.   My wife and I chose careers whose earning potentials are very different.  You could argue that she was pushed toward hers because she's a woman, but she like it and she's damned good at it and it's important work.  You could argue that mine is paid better because it's male dominated, but you'd be wrong.  In my profession, about half of medical students are female.  They face different challenges than their male colleagues, but there here and there stampin' out disease.  They're also becoming mommies.  As physicians, we work together intimately enough that it would be very hard to hide the fact that you're a parent, and we'd all think it quite strange if you tried.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of message would it send to my female residents if the female attendings "hid" their motherhood?  Who's the oppressor now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is work.  It's hard.  And finding balance, for both parents, in a world where we all have to earn a living and put food on the table, and have time to cuddle and care for our kids is sometimes nearly impossible.  But nothing about that is ever going to get better if we tell our younger colleagues that it truly is impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/im_proud_of_scienceblogs.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/496758367" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230440575404"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1a7e2da3abd9510d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Mountain Lion</title><published>2008-12-28T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-28T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/hunting/mountainlion.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">E-mailed pictures of mountain lion hail from all over the U.S.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230427189262"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/radio_reminder_41.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/48df2ccc066ef349</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Radio reminder</title><published>2008-12-28T01:14:13Z</published><updated>2008-12-28T01:14:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/496664621/radio_reminder_41.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/radio_reminder_41.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tune in on Sunday morning at 9am Central time to &lt;a title="Minnesota Atheists - Positive Atheism In Action! - Top Life Science Stories in 2008 - Atheists Talk #51, December 28, 2008" href="http://mnatheists.org/content/view/231/1/"&gt;Atheists Talk radio&lt;/a&gt; for an all-science hour, reviewing the top science stories of the past year.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt; &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/twitter_logo.png" alt="Twitter logo"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m checking my &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; updates, and someone (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/coostreehouse"&gt;coostreehouse&lt;/a&gt;) says that she found me using TwitterGrader, which gives everyone on Twitter a ranking. OK, what the heck, I check &lt;a href="http://twitter.grader.com/Badastronomer"&gt;my TwitterGrade&lt;/a&gt;. Holy frak! I rank 199 out of 774,000 Twitterers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but think that’s bad. Like, maybe I need to do better things with my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I think that I do keep up with my friends that way, and pimp the blog that way, and read about people I like that way. And it’s not like it eats up more than 15 minutes a day. OK, maybe 30. Still, no biggie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I check who follows me. Holy frak again! &lt;a href="http://www.breagrant.com/"&gt;Brea Grant&lt;/a&gt;! Like, the chick from &amp;quot;Heroes&amp;quot; Brea Grant! &lt;em&gt;Cool&lt;/em&gt;. I knew about most of the others: skeptics, scifi people, astronomy nerds like me. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/wilw"&gt;Wil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I think, &amp;quot;Say, how &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; followers do I have right now?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: &lt;em&gt;2974!&lt;/em&gt; Holy frak cubed, that means I’m close to having 3000! &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;Who will be my trimillennial follower&lt;/a&gt;? I’m not sure I know how to find out who that person will be/is. And if you are that special person, what do you win? Why, nothing! You &lt;em&gt;lose!&lt;/em&gt; Good &lt;em&gt;day&lt;/em&gt; sir!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oops. Sorry. Willy Wonka moment there. But seriously, that’s pretty incredible. What I’d love to see is a demographic breakdown of followers: geographic location, gender, race (yes, the term is ill-defined, but still has useful properties for demographics), interests. Who out there will write that app? Or does it already exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Twitter came out, I thought it was pretty useless. I changed my mind when, just a few days after I first signed up in April 2007, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer/status/34456182"&gt;a gunman at Johnson Space Center held people hostage&lt;/a&gt; and I live-tweeted it; I got several emails from people in the aerospace biz thanking me because they couldn’t get updates at work through the web. Then I tweeted a Shuttle launch, and again got lots of support. Now I see its ability to reach people simply and easily (as well as tell them what I had for dinner, hooray for teh webz!) and I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So join me! All you have to lose is colossal amounts of time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230423765187"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-7053861408612835477">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5af75a4e1b4827b7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">C.S.

Upon researching further I found that the theory expressed is the &lt;em&gt;Ransom Theory of Atonement&lt;/em&gt; which has been recently defended by &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hn1gaNlri1cC&amp;amp;pg=PA245&amp;amp;lpg=PA245&amp;amp;dq=The+Atonement+in+Narnia&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=JWO4ugVDaS&amp;amp;sig=exSLq8mCBRfy_Z1P-9_MvJMGZ4o&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=2&amp;amp;ct=result#PPA245,M1"&gt;Charles Taliaferro&lt;/a&gt;. It's known as the "classical view" in that it was the one adopted by theologians up until St. Anselm. To see it explained and criticized &lt;a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_atone7.htm"&gt;read through this&lt;/a&gt; (just skip the ad).  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticisms of this theory:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ransom theory, as well as other violence-based atonement explanations, suffer from an inconsistency in Christian teaching: The church has traditionally taught that a person is responsible for their own sin, and that a person cannot morally be punished for the sins of others. Of course, they deviated from this teaching, as when they taught as late as the mid-20th century that modern-day Jews were responsible for the execution of Yeshua (a.k.a. Jesus Christ). But in general, people were not held responsible for the sins of others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The church has also historically taught that the default destination for all humans currently living, after death, will be Hell because of the Adam and Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden when they ate the forbidden fruit. All will be tortured in Hell, unless they are saved through sacraments and/or good works and/or faith. The sin of Eve and Adam were imputed to the entire human race. More liberal Christian faith groups have deviated from this belief and teach universalism -- that nobody will spend eternity in Hell. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Most liberal and many mainline Christians believe that Adam and Eve were mythical humans. That is, they didn't exist as actual people. Without that belief, this atonement theory collapses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Christians note that Eve and Adam were created as proto-humans without a sense of sin. After all, they ate the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in order to develop a knowledge of good and evil. Being without a moral sense, they cannot be responsible for eating the fruit any more than an animal might. Again, if the first parents are not responsible for eating the fruit, the atonement theory collapses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil Johnson, Executive Director of Grace to You states that there is no support in the Bible for the concept that Satan has a legitimate claim on sinners. He suggests that the "Biblical word ransom simply means 'redemption-price;' it does not necessarily imply a price paid to Satan."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several passages in the Bible imply that Christ's death was a ritual sacrifice to God, and thereby not to Satan: Isaiah 53:10: "Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand." &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Ephesians 5:2: "And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour." The reference to a sweet smelling savor is seen throughout the Hebrew Scriptures in reference to animal sacrifices in the Temple being cooked at the altar, with the fragrance wafting upwards towards Heaven where God was seated on his throne. The ancient Hebrews believed that Heaven was only a few hundred feet above the earth. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Origen's version requires that God acts in a deceitful manner. That is does not match the traditional Christian belief about the justice, honesty, and truthfulness of God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many versions of the ransom theory assume that Satan is unaware of the magical powers of Yeshua. The later version assumes that Satan is deluded into thinking that he is more powerful than Yeshua. Yet Satan is portrayed in the Bible as a dedicated, intelligent, and evil angel, not a quasi-deity who is so disconnected from reality that he is unaware of Yeshua's capabilities. Satan is not described in the Bible as suffering from delusions of grandeur. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire concept of Satan as a living entity is rejected by many Christians today; they view Satan as a symbol of evil, not as an actual person. If Satan is not an all-evil quasi-deity, Origen's theory collapses.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Bible identifies Satan as a created being; a fallen angel who disobeyed God. Similarly, humans are commonly portrayed as created beings who have disobeyed God and fallen. There is no obvious rationale for assuming that Satan had control over all of humanity any more than the reverse might have been true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnibeneficient, just, and ethical, it is illogical to assume that he would be willing to allow his son to be tortured to death if there were another way to achieve atonement. God might have, for example, simply forgiven Adam and Eve for their sin. According to the gospels, Yeshua repeatedly taught that extending forgiveness is to take the moral high road. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Professor of Philosophy Michael Martin writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Since, on the ransom theory, after Jesus' death and resurrection, human beings were out of the devil's clutches, it would seem that the way to salvation would simply be to follow a life free from sin so as not to fall under the devil's control. What has faith in Jesus got to do with this? The ransom theory supplies no answer." &lt;/blockquote&gt;There are three additional criticisms of the Ransom Theory which also apply to other atonement theories. They attribute to God the same sort of cruel, hate-filled, punishing behavior seen in the lives of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, etc:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no obvious mechanism whereby a person can achieve salvation and atonement with God by simply expressing faith and/or trust in Yeshua.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If trusting Yeshua were the only path to atonement and salvation, then those who have followed a non-Christian religion would not achieve salvation and atonement. They would be sent to Hell after death for what is basically the commission of a thought crime -- believing in the wrong God or in no God. Current moral belief systems -- both religious and secular -- consider punishment for thought crimes to be immoral and unjust.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ransom theory would also route many non-Christians to Hell after death for the simple reason that they have not had the opportunity to learn of Yeshua, Christianity, or the gospel message. Being ignorant of Yeshua, they could not trust him as Lord and Savior and be saved. The Ransom Theory punishes non-Christians for not having made a decision in favor of someone of whom they are unaware. This appears to many people to be irrational, unjust, and immoral. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The advert suggests that wearing a seat belt protects your internal organs from impact, by depicting an unrestrained man who dies due to his organs being turned into something you'd use in gravy after smashing up against his rib cage. What people have been asking is, how on Earth does a seatbelt restrain your internal organs? Surely by restraining your rib cage in place it just makes the impact even worse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over two months ago I wrote &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/10/madeleine-mccann.html"&gt;Psychics Make Firm Predictions&lt;/a&gt; – about how some “TV psychics” had information about Madeleine McCann, the four year old English girl who disappeared in Portugal in May 2007.  As I wrote back then, the information they came up with included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;What the abductor looks like – with a drawing &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The abductor’s first name &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The actual address of an apartment where the abductor was supposed to have stopped &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The location of Madeleine’s body. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They supposedly gave this information to the Portuguese police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, nothing has come of this information.  Although they gave the police the location of Madeleine’s body, no body has been discovered in this high profile case.  There has been no report of searches of the apartment where the abductor supposedly stopped with Madeleine (and the actual address was given, remember).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote two emails to the &lt;em&gt;Express&lt;/em&gt; reporter, Mike Parker, who wrote the story I cited, requesting more information.  Lacking an actual email address for him, I wrote to the &lt;a href="mailto:news.desk@express.co.uk?subject=Fwd:%20To%20Mike%20Parker%20-%20re%20Madeleine%20McCann%20story"&gt;general news desk email&lt;/a&gt;, asking it be forwarded to Mike Parker.  My first email, sent Oct 26, was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regarding your story about the &amp;quot;psychic&amp;quot; pictures etc of Madeleine McCann&amp;#39;s abductor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You state in your report that the address of an apartment and the location of Madeleine&amp;#39;s body have both been given to the local police.  Can you tell me, have the police searched these locations?  Clearly Madeleine&amp;#39;s body hasn&amp;#39;t been found otherwise we would have heard of it by now.  Do you know why not?  Didn&amp;#39;t the police search the area given by the psychics?  If they did, what do the psychics have to say to explain why the body wasn&amp;#39;t found?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Also, could you please tell me who at the FBI told you that &amp;quot;all three members of the Haunting Evidence team have been used in major criminal investigations&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried again on December 21:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mr Parker:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In light of the continued lack of progress in finding Madeleine, and the parents&amp;#39; new video appeal issued today, I wonder if you had thought about my questions that I raised some eight weeks ago (see below).  I understand that you have pressures to write a story, and that &amp;quot;psychic&amp;quot; stories sell copy, but don&amp;#39;t you think it&amp;#39;s time for another story following up on the psychics&amp;#39; success (or lack thereof) in locating Madeleine and/or her abductor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received no reply to either email.  So we have a reporter, who wrote a fluff “psychics are real” piece, who isn’t interested in following up to see if his facts were correct,  Sadly, no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more significantly, I also tried to contact the TV so-called psychics.  They have no published email address, so I used their &lt;a href="http://www.trutv.com/contact/feedbackform.asp?subject_id=101&amp;amp;start=true"&gt;contact page&lt;/a&gt;.  My second message to them, also sent December 21, was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;In light of the continued lack of progress in finding Madeleine, and the parents&amp;#39; new video appeal issued today, I was reminded by the claims made in your TV program some months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As I recall, you stated that that the address of an apartment and the location of Madeleine&amp;#39;s body had both been given to the local police.  Can you tell me, have the police searched these locations?  Clearly Madeleine&amp;#39;s body hasn&amp;#39;t been found otherwise we would have heard of it by now.  Do you know why not?  Didn&amp;#39;t the police search the area you gave them?  If they did, how do you explain why the body wasn&amp;#39;t found?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I only received their canned “thank you for taking your time to submit comments…” reply.  A message left on their &lt;a href="http://boards.trutv.com/showthread.php?p=13310"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; on October 25 also went unanswered.  And I wasn’t the only one asking for evidence that they had actually solved any crimes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the blurb they have about themselves on their &lt;a href="http://www.trutv.com/shows/haunting_evidence/index.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Psychic profiler Carla Baron, medium John J. Oliver and paranormal investigator Patrick Burns take a terrifying descent into the heart of evil, as they see murders through the killer’s mind and the victim’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These people make me sick.  They make a living and get fame based on made-up claims of using Psi powers.  When asked reasonable questions about why nothing came of their lame pretend-psychic drivel, they hide behind automatic reply emails.  Their enabler in the mainstream press is no better.  “TruTV” (sic) and The Daily Express should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105369f6b45970c-pi"&gt;&lt;img alt="Three Liars" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105369f6b45970c-800wi" title="Three Liars"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Evidently the NPR show This American Life &lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=370"&gt;had a segment&lt;/a&gt; about a recent outbreak of measles in San Diego: an unvaccinated kid caught the measles overseas, and gave it to several other children. The blurb for the podcast is interesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… Like the San Diego parents who didn’t vaccinate their child for measles …  When their seven-year-old caught the disease on an overseas trip, this decision became a whole community’s problem.  The outbreak infected 11 children and endangered many others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it sounds to me like the community is at fault here as well, since it’s up to everyone to get vaccinated. If we could marginalize the people who are antivax, make them a very very small minority of people, &lt;em&gt;then herd immunity in the community would prevent more of our children from falling ill from completely preventable and sometimes fatal diseases&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have said many, many times, the irony here is that antivaxxers want to save children’s lives, but they are doing the exact opposite: putting our kids at a fearful risk of death because they don’t understand the scientific method. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/08/22/antivaxxers-must-be-stopped-now/"&gt;Vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230398023056"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-9013700655004903960">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0c9cb58dba549f6a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Philosophers and the Existence of God</title><published>2008-12-27T16:40:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-27T17:12:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/philosophers-and-existence-of-god.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/9013700655004903960/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=9013700655004903960" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The existence of God is one of the exciting questions in philosophy.

Case in point: &lt;a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2008/12/27/creationism-recapitulates-kirbyism/"&gt;Jack Kirby was an evolutionary ignoramus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="relatedformoflive.jpg.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/27/relatedformoflive.jpg.jpeg" width="420" height="400"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that&amp;#39;s just sad. Of course we share this world with related forms of life — we&amp;#39;ve been looking for years, and what would be a disturbing enigma would be if we found a species that was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; related to every other species on the planet. So I'm afraid those panels contain three characters, every one of whom is babbling complete drivel. Still, you have to concede that Jack Kirby was a major influence on comic book art, and stylistically, he's one of those artists whose work is instantly recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt that Martin Patterson has quite the name recognition, but he is recognizable as a stereotype: the pompous, stupid creationist with a pocketful of fallacies that he thinks trumps the work of nearly every biologist on Earth, and isn't shy about pontificating on the subject.


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I am somewhat disappointed that the blogs require you to be an atheist or agnostic to post a discussion. There is no point in having a blog if only individuals who share the same views are allowed to join. That only defeats the purpose of hearing other opinions for consideration or research. If I were to start a blog only for people who believe that the earth is flat, what would we learn from each other? That is the blind leading the blind. I hope you will share that with your fellow bloggers so that they might consider opening a real scientific debate on the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you see, I developed this special mind-reading software that can instantly discern the philosophical position of my readers, and block them from commenting if they try to argue with me. The only catch I&amp;#39;ve discovered so far, and that you readers may have noticed as well, is that creationists are still able to freely post — it turns out that mind-reading software is completely stymied by mindless people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. You read that first paragraph, even that first sentence, and you immediately realize that the writer is an utter moron. That impression is not corrected by the second schmear of a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I primarily wanted to write to you to make a statement about the debate between "Science" and "Religion".  One thing that must be made clear in the debate between  "Evolution" and "Creation",  is that it is not "Science" vs. "Religion", it is "Religion" vs. "Religion". They are both religious world views. The basis for that is this: If you look at the evidence that is used to support the evolution theory, that same evidence can be used to support the creation theory. It is all a matter of perspective. Why then do "Scientists" have such a hard time admitting this? All the evidence that is used to support the Evolution theory as a whole is based off of other ideas and theories that cannot be empirically verified (assumptions based on other assumptions). That is not science.  Often times, in the "Scientific" community, when evidence arises that  brings to question the validity of the evolution theory, that evidence is simply ignored, or actively suppressed by threatening the source with repercussions or raising doubts about its credibility. That is not science either. Science is using factual information as a basis to test and verify or disprove new ideas. It is also un-bias and leaves all options open for investigation. But in reality, the scientific community is extremely bias on issues that bring to question the validity of evolution, which so much of their work is based off of. The "Big Bang" theory is a great example because it can easily be disproved by the Law of Angular Momentum, the second Law of Thermodynamics, and a number of others. All it takes is one, but it always seems to be that "one" that gets left out when they are trying to convince us of something that isn't true. Yet some still teach it. Why call a theory "science" when it can be scientifically proven to be false? When we look at Evolution, Micro Evolution is scientific because it can be observed, tested, and verified. But that is a far stretch from the fantasy of Macro Evolution, Cosmic Evolution, Molecular Evolution, and others. Yet "scientists" try to bunch them all together using Micro Evolution as their example so they won't be forced to answer questions about the others. There are a lot of theories out there about the others, but there is no scientific evidence to prove them. Why then are these subjects taught to our children as fact?  If the "Scientific" community wants to have any credibility anymore, they are going to be forced to answer questions about the overwhelming evidence that supports Creation and admit that Creation is no more a religious belief than Evolution. There is far more scientific evidence for creation than there is for evolution, so they are going to have a hard time explaining why creation should not be taught in schools. To give validity to what I have said, feel free to contact me with any questions or challenges. I will be more than happy to answer them with verified scientific evidence (that is legitimate, it has just been ignored) including sources. I can be contacted at martinj803@gmail.com. It is not my intention to come across as hostile, so if I sound as if I am on the attack or have offended you in any way, I do apologize. I am simply concerned about the credibility of the scientific community and want to develop an open forum for all views to be discussed in a professional an respectful manner (in the true nature of the scientific method). FYI, I used to be an evolutionist until I did my research. I just want to share what I have learned with other intellectuals so that they can make educated conclusions based off of factual evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a mish-mash. Evolution is a religion, the mangled micro-macro distinction, disproof by the second law of thermodynamics, creationism has more evidence than evolution…it&amp;#39;s just the usual gallop through the garbage of creationism that accumulates year by year through the repetition of lies, all dressed up in the pompous pretense that this ignoramus is an &amp;quot;intellectual&amp;quot;. I am not going to discuss such stupidity with any creationists, especially not in email. It&amp;#39;s a total waste of time; do I really need to go over the inanity of their second law arguments &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;? That's what Mark Isaak's &lt;i&gt;The Counter-Creationism Handbook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520249267/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=0520249267&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=0520249267&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=0520249267" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is for — it succinctly rips up those trivial fallacies and gets them out of the way. Creationists, if you want to write to me, and you haven&amp;#39;t done your homework, I am going to rightfully regard you as a thumb-sucking moron and throw your mail in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a better strategy. Show me that you really have done your research (Martin Patterson clearly has not), and bring up specific issues from any of these excellent pop-sci books on the subject of evolution. They all bring up various points that are routinely mumbled by creationists, and they dissect them in detail, showing the positive evidence for evolution. Just once I'd like one of these gibbering lackwits to actually question something significant in evolutionary theory, with some modicum of facts to back up their claims, rather than parroting the same old crap they got from the clueless clown in a clerical collar on Sunday morning. Read these!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an onerous demand. These books are not overly technical, they aren't part of the specialist literature, they are just general introductions to the ideas and evidence of evolution. If the stuff I get in my email is at all representative, it's obvious that these jokers haven't even done as much as read &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of these kinds of books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The backstory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FootwearSemiotics2.gif"&gt;&lt;img title="Click for a larger version" src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/FootwearSemiotics2.gif" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the commentary on the famous Iraqi shoe-chucking incident, this is the first one I've seen that points out the generally jocular and positive (or at least ironically negative) implications of footwear projectiles in western culture. More specifically, I haven't seen any mention in this connection of the "wedding shoe" tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how it used to be — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D02E5D91538E533A25752C1A9649C94669FD7CF"&gt;Throwing the wedding shoe&lt;/a&gt;", NYT 2/11/1887:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This custom of throwing one or more old shoes after the bride and groom either when they go to church to be married or when they start on their wedding journey, is so old that the memory of man stretches not back to its beginning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or E. Cobham Brewer, &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/81/15276.html"&gt;Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&lt;/a&gt;, 1898:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It has long been a custom in England, Scotland, and elsewhere, to throw an old shoe, or several shoes, at the bride and bridegroom when they quit the bride’s home, after the wedding breakfast, or when they go to church to get married. Some think this represents an assault and refers to the ancient notion that the bridegroom carried off the bride with force and violence. Others look upon it as a relic of the ancient law of exchange, implying that the parents of the bride give up henceforth all right of dominion to their daughter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be connected to the idea that throwing old shoes is a way to bring good luck more generally — at least we find things like this couplet from Will Carleton&amp;#39;s 1886 &amp;quot;How we fought the fire&amp;quot;, in a list of the stuff that came out of a burning house:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Old shoes enough, if properly thrown,&lt;br&gt;
To bring good luck to all creatures known;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Robert Dixon's 1683 &lt;em&gt;Canidia; or The Witches&lt;/em&gt; includes several references to such a superstition, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;But throw an Old-shoe with a Spell,&lt;br&gt;
Or nail a Horse-shoe cross the Cell,&lt;br&gt;
'Twill drive away Devil or Man,&lt;br&gt;
And let them hurt you if they can. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;For good luck, throw after me an Old Shoe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, I guess the residue of this tradition is just tying shoes to a newlywed couple's car, if that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[See also James E. Crombie, "&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1252997?seq=1"&gt;Shoe-throwing at Weddings&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Folklore&lt;/em&gt; 6(3): 258-281, 1895, which cites the "time-honoured custom to throw an old show after anyone setting out on a journey to bring him luck", and quotes a couplet attributed to John Heywoods (1598):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And home againe hitherwards quicke as a bee,&lt;br&gt;
Now for good luck, cast an old shoe after me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

have time to write while I'm away, I'm taking the opportunity to re-run an old classic series
of posts on numbers, which were first posted in the summer of 2006. These posts are mildly

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. Todays number is &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;, aka Euler's constant, aka the natural log base. &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; is a very odd number, but very fundamental. It shows up constantly, in all sorts of strange places where you wouldn't expect it. &lt;/p&gt;

We’re going to be doing some Skepchickal Trivia where I’ll be giving away a 750 ml bottle of Buzzed Aldrin! (It is a corked and sealed bottle, so yes you can take it with you wherever you may be heading after your victory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And rumor has it that our very own Skepchick Superhero, &lt;strong&gt;kevinh&lt;/strong&gt;, will be in town and may be attending.  Who is Kevin, you ask? Kevin is the the very intelligent designer of the&lt;em&gt; Buzzed Aldrin&lt;/em&gt;, runner up in the Skepchick Drink Contest and official drink of Skepchick. Perhaps he may even sign the bottle for the winner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who else will be there? Skepchick’s &lt;strong&gt;Miss January&lt;/strong&gt;! If you bring your Calendar, you can get an autograph! Totally free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you’re all going to be exhausted from celebrating Boxing Day, but I’m only asking for a few of your hours, a few beers, a few laughs, and a few jokes. You can handle that. So be there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trivia will start around 7:30&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten how to blog all of a sudden — I&amp;#39;ve been distracted. I wrenched an ankle wrestling with a snow blower the other day, and woke up this morning with my foot all swoll up like a lumpy ol&amp;#39; potato with five little toes wiggling at one end. It&amp;#39;s not good.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s actually a pretty good list — suitably snarky, of course — and fun to read. Well, fun if you’re not actually involved with any of the suits. Their first choice is antiscience goofball Walter Wagner who sued CERN to stop the LHC because he thought it would create a black hole and destroy the Earth. Presumably that includes Hawaii, which is where he filed suit, even though CERN is a European facility, and the US involvement in building the LHC was pretty much done by the time he filed charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also include the time in 1897 when Indiana politicians considered redefining π. That’s a stretch as far as suing science goes, but it’s noteworthy enough to include. There’s also homeopathy, astrology, &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; medicine… read and enjoy. And remember, it’s fun to read it on a web page, but this stuff is real. Their #2 pick involves friend of skepticism (and TAM 6 speaker) Ben Goldacre, who is a pretty funny guy, but I bet he wasn’t laughing through most of his encounter with a guy who said vitamins cure AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let’s not forget &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/24/uk-quackery-on-trial/"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt;, who’s being sued by chiropracters who claim they can cure asthma, but in reality they can’t cure anything. Worse, thy lure people away from getting real treatment. And, worst of all, sometimes they kill people, too. And that’s not funny at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230327899690"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2008://2.4083">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/39b1ce1344ea29f2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Improving science education" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Ohio" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="aaasfellow" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="AAAS Fellow"/><category term="mckee" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="McKee"/><category term="ohio" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="Ohio"/><title type="html">Congratulations to Jeff McKee, recently elected AAAS Fellow</title><published>2008-12-26T20:50:36Z</published><updated>2008-12-26T21:14:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/congratulations-2.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff McKee, &lt;a href="http://anthropology.osu.edu/faculty/pages/mckee.php" rel="external "&gt;professor of anthropology&lt;/a&gt; at the Ohio State University, &lt;a href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/2008aaasfellows.htm" rel="external "&gt;was recently elected a Fellow&lt;/a&gt; of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in the anthropology section.  According to the linked press release, the honor was “For distinguished contributions to paleoanthropology, evolutionary biology, and science education.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last, “science education,” has to refer at least in part to Jeff’s leading role in the intelligent design creationism wars at the Ohio State Board of Education from 2002 to 2006.  Jeff was one of the stalwarts in that battle, standing firm in the face of unflattering comments from creationist former members Deborah Owens-Fink and Father Michael Cochran.  Jeff was also a central figure in exposing the attempted subversion of the Ohio State University’s degree granting process by packing a creationist’s doctoral committee (see &lt;a href="http://www.thelantern.com/media/paper333/news/2005/06/23/Campus/Osu-Takes.Closer.Look.At.Graduate.Students.Dissertation-958954.shtml" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/001145.html" rel=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for accounts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff is a distinguished paleoanthropologist specializing in human evolution, and has made significant contributions to both the academic discipline and to science education.  And he’s a very nice guy, to boot.  Many thanks, Jeff!  And kudos to AAAS for recognizing a man who has been a strong defender of honest science in the public schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can bitch about the presents you wanted to get and didn’t. &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230317007834"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/friday_cephalopod_only_308_day.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf73d8cffff19c09</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cephalopods"/><title type="html">Friday Cephalopod: Only 308 days until Halloween!</title><published>2008-12-26T17:59:48Z</published><updated>2008-12-26T17:59:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/495728550/friday_cephalopod_only_308_day.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/friday_cephalopod_only_308_day.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="VampSeibel.jpg.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/26/VampSeibel.jpg.jpeg" width="442" height="300"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vampyroteuthis infernalis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;PETER KNIGHTS, CO-FOUNDER, WILDAID:  The tradition will end.  The question is will it end before there's any sharks left? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be one of those cases where the interaction among multiple negatives and scalar predicates ends up one negative off, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=overnegation"&gt;plus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu+undernegation&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;minus&lt;/a&gt;. At least for me, Mr. Knights&amp;#39; sentence means roughly the opposite of what he intended, if it means anything at all. (I take it that he meant &amp;quot;… before there&amp;#39;s no sharks left&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;… before all the sharks are gone&amp;quot;.) But apparently CNN&amp;#39;s editors didn&amp;#39;t have any problem with it — was this a sign of a difference in grammar, or just another indication that mis-negation is hard to fail to miss?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are enough examples of this type out there to suggest that for some people, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; can sometimes mean something like "hardly any" or "barely any":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://forum.skyatnightmagazine.com/tm.asp?m=82980"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) I'm probably getting paid more than most comics on the club circuit.  It's just that all of it goes before there's any money left for kit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2007/06/08/how-to-deal-with-rising-healthcare-costs"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) Russ Mitchell weighs in on the subject of healthcare today, and specifically the problem that healthcare technology is driving prices up so far and so fast that at present rates it won't be all that long until there's any money left over for anything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take it that the authors of these sentences wouldn't use "any money" to mean "hardly any money" in a simple clause, without the context of a subordinator like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;before &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;until&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;?There's any money left for kit. ≠ There's hardly any money left for kit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;?There's any money left over for anything else. ≠ There's hardly any money left for anything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So perhaps this is just another example like "no head injury is too trivial to ignore", where there isn't a different grammar, but just a common confusion. But I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230310311922"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=952">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/83cab28c968da88e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language play"/><title type="html">Deflationary language</title><published>2008-12-26T16:50:08Z</published><updated>2008-12-26T16:50:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=952" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Things have been rather quiet here at Language Log Plaza. Monday I was the only one in the office. With nothing else to do I decided to play an old Victor Borge tape and it gave me an idea that might be an interesting game you can play during the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Borge made inflationary language popular, or at least his presentation of it did. It was a great idea for the glory days of constant inflation, but things are just not the same today. We’re now told that deflation is rampant in our economy. Naturally, that would call for Victor Borge to revise his inflationary language routine to its opposite. Since he’s no longer with us to do it, someone has to. Try  it. It’s lots of fun and it makes a nice holiday party conversation. So here are some samples to get you started:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folk tale: “Never upon a time there were two little pigs…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincloln: One score and six years ago our fathers brought third on this continent…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frost’s “One road diverged into a yellow wood…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional “The Eleven days of Christmas”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kesey’s  “Zero Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare’s Eleventh Night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare’s “One Gentleman of Verona”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana’s “One Year Before the Mast”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dumas’s “The Two Musketeers”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arabian Nights: “Ali Baba and the Thirty-nine Thieves”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget the six wonders of the world, your four senses, the six seas, sixth heaven, and good old Alfred Lord Nineyson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you can do a lot better than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go third and have some Borgean language fun. Don’t give it a first thought. You probably need a break anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230309444571"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3577">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bfa9689c30e52ba3</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Guitar Hero"/><category term="Interviews"/><category term="Q&amp;A"/><title type="html">The "Guitar Hero" Will Now Take Your Questions</title><published>2008-12-26T16:19:12Z</published><updated>2008-12-26T16:19:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/Uasj1ni_nr8/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/the-guitar-hero-will-now-take-your-questions/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Photo: The 5th Ape

His was the kind of nickname that would be tough to bear on the playground, but despite being a teacher for decades, any juvenile thoughts wouldn't have crossed his mind.  I don't think he knew how to be insulted.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while he may not have been easy to insult, he did have pride, and as he became more and more disabled by chronic illness, his frustration grew.  His attitude and that of his wife was remarkable.  Sure, he complained about being dependent on others, but when he needed to start dialysis, he took it in stride.  When he became more and more physically unable, his intellectual life continued to flourish. He continued to be a film and theater maven, and read plays for a local theater group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But certain things he just could not bear.  When he became incontinent, when he could no longer lift a book or turn its pages, he began to lose hope.  There are certainly some people who can go on living with dignity and vivacity, despite being locked in an uncooperative body, but Dick wasn't one of them.  The insult to his dignity was too much, and being deprived of his intellectual pursuits by weakness and delirium was too much.  He was miserable, although he still had a smile for my daughter.  He was afraid---afraid of being alone while unable to do for himself.  He couldn't even push a call button for a nurse.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was some hope.  Despite his poor health, surgeons tried to decompress his spinal cord, and he was set to go to rehab, but recovery, such as it was, was slow, and medical complications kept him away from physical therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a man who worked hard, and whose intellectual curiosity took him all over the globe, before diabetes and vascular disease robbed him of his ability to travel widely.  Early in his life, when his country called him to duty, the Army made an uncharacteristically wise decision and assigned him to military intelligence.  He seemed much less conflicted about his service than many others---while being a dedicated liberal, and strongly anti-war, he served his country proudly, although I think he was genuinely puzzled as to how such a bizarre institution as the U.S. Army could function without recourse to logical thought.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick taught high school most of his life, including history, social studies, and drama.  He was proud of his students, and of his work with them.  He loved to brag when a student "made it"---Sanjay Gupta, my fellow physician, was a former student, as was one of my medical residents.  His students said wonderful things about him, and I presume this is because he was visibly fascinated by history and politics, and loved to share his knowledge and thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and his wife adopted two children in the late sixties, when adoption wasn't quite the common practice it is today.  I was lucky enough to marry one of them.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, when the hospital called to say he was in cardiac arrest, we rushed to his bedside.  It was clear he never had a chance---whatever did him in happened quickly and efficiently.  Earlier in the day, my wife was spending time with him, listening to his confused moans, and when she got up to say goodbye, he said, "you have a beautiful smile.  Where did you get such a beautiful smile?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick, she got her smile from you, her passion from you.  How could you even wonder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_________________&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, as he became sicker, he was always cold.  He wore a sweater even in the heat of the Midwestern summer.  I'm reminded of nothing so much as the Robert Service poem "The Cremation of Sam McGee", where a man, stranded in the Arctic cold, enjoins his friend to cremate him, no matter how impossible the task.  And while our family's cultural tradition calls for burial, I can't help but think of Sam McGee, dead for days in the Arctic cold, finally delivered to warmth by his friend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door.
It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm--
Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dick, when I escorted you to the hospital morgue, you looked so small.  I can't believe that hours earlier, you were such a tall, imposing figure.  But on this ice-glazed December morning you looked peaceful and warm, and for that, you and I are both grateful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/eulogy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/495648419" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230308294080"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4953">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/bd04ea1d7c932f04</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Comments"/><title type="html">COTW XMAS!</title><published>2008-12-26T16:03:19Z</published><updated>2008-12-26T16:03:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4953" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not in my parents’ house. I am in an alternate universe where everything is made of sugar and Jeff Dunham is funny. There are 700 TV channels and not one has shown a commercial that wasn’t designed by and for idiots. Video Professor will teach me how to sell on eBay! Pay no mind to the free FAQ and step-by-step instructions on eBay’s web site! And now it’s SNUGGIE, the blanket with sleeves! It’s a blanket! With sleeves! The Snuggie! Two for the price of one! Two Snuggies! For the price of one Snuggie! Snuggie keeps your arms warm! Snuggie! Oh look, it’s Slim Clip, the amazing stainless steel wallet that you can put in the blender, if putting wallets in blenders is your sort of thing! That’s exactly how I lost my last wallet. And oh look, the History Channel has a show called UFO Hunters, because nothing says accurate historical scholarship like a weekly search for things that maybe don’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Diary,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy casualties today. Stumbled onto an advance party, scouts from the 1225th Hollyhuckers. We traded small arms fire, but their main force arrived too quickly, and we were overwhelmed. Private Leibowitz went to work on them with his nine-pronged flame thrower, and those of use who were still alive managed to retreat into the safety of the pine forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked back, and saw them hit Leibowitz’s position with a missle; TOW, I believe. They’ll be sending what’s left of him home in a Ziploc bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a dozen of us made it back to the cave, and we’ve been holed up there ever since. We’ve got the lights down low and we’re trying not to be noticed. Those of us who still have an appetite are quietly munching on some egg rolls that I scrounged from the mess before we hiked down into this awful place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lieutenant thinks if we lay low for long enough, they’ll give up and let us go. I can hear him discussing it with three of our wisest men. The murmur of their voices almost sounds comforting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawkins is on watch. He yells from the mouth of the cave. I see a starburst flare, high in the sky to the East. I hear ordinance cracking in long strings, like popping corn. Splashes of blood, bright crimson, stain Dawkins’ green fatigues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re not going to make it out of here…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was that too literal an interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, that was just literal enough. Well done Oskar, your efforts have won you a SNUGGIE! You’ll have to assemble it yourself, though: just take an old sweatshirt and staple it to a blanket. Ta-da, Snuggie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: Those of you who enjoyed Oskar’s entry should be sure to listen to Sam’s essay at the very end of the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4903"&gt;Very Special Skepchick War on Christmas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230305937223"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-5139426164308385098">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5aa647ec404dbd30</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="movie review: religulous" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="bill maher" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Holman" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="debunking christianity" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Movie Review: Religulous</title><published>2008-12-26T14:38:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-27T06:37:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/495617226/movie-review-religulous.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/5139426164308385098/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=5139426164308385098" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/movie-review-religulous.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">This review is late, way late! The release of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Religulous &lt;/span&gt;was on October 1, 2008 and only now am I getting to review it. Why is that? Because down in the south where I live, even we movie critics couldn’t get it because we’re in the Bible Belt and most theatres wouldn’t carry it. We have the always tolerant, loving, and nonjudgmental Jesus-courters to thank for that. What I had to do to finally get a demo copy of the film was quite disgusting. It involved me in the back seat of a 1996 Buick Skylark getting down and dirty for 35 minutes with a tranny hooker named Philecia.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, now that I made you chuckle, I’m about to turn the floor over to a real comedian, Bill Maher, creator of the hilariously offensive documentary. Being an avid and outspoken atheist myself, it would be biased of me to put a grade on Religulous unlike the rest of my reviews at &lt;a href="http://www.holmansmoviereview.com/"&gt;holmansmoviereview.com&lt;/a&gt;. To say that I agree with Maher’s conclusions should be obvious. So, I’m sitting this one out and letting Bill Maher do the promoting of godless activism for right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maher’s travels for the project took him to Israel in Megiddo, the Mt. of Olives, to Italy to the Vatican where he was thrown out, to the Netherlands to visit a weeded-out “God” junkie, and to some other places in the United States (including the Mormon Temple in Utah where he was bounced from the property) to get feedback on those coats of many colors called God and religion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What’s the problem with the world? The problem is religion and timing: “Before man figured out how to be rational and peaceful, he figured out nuclear weapons and how to pollute on a catastrophic scale,” says Maher. It is the intolerance generated by religious convictions that gives man the false assurance that he is right and cannot be wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maher makes a lot of people uncomfortable, and sometimes you even want to sympathize with them. Take, for instance, a chapel for truckers in North Carolina where Maher stops in to ask some questions. Within minutes of filming, one of them says: “You start disputin’ my god, then you got a problem.” But the problem with people like that is not disputing God. There’s no critical thinking going on. “I’m promoting doubt.” Maher says. “The other guys are selling certainty, not me.” How should we think? We should learn from our mistakes and realize that nobody has all the answers: “History is just a litany of getting shit wrong.” And “Religion is dangerous because it allows people who don’t have all the answers to think that they do.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Francis Collins, one of the world’s leading DNA experts, is questioned on his adhering to Christian convictions while 93% of all scientists in the National Academy of Sciences are either atheist or agnostic. I would like to have seen more of the interview with Dr. Collins, which I felt was a bit too heavily edited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other interviews were gut-busting-ly funny, sometimes to the point of being awkward, like Maher’s interview with “ex-gay” pastor John Wescott. Just watch, and if you don’t cringe, I’ll give you a dollar! Democratic senator Mark Pryor is on tape admitting that the earth might be 5,000 years old. The creationist movement’s Ken Ham is interviewed just after a shot of a triceratops with a saddle on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After getting booted from the Vatican, Maher’s interview with a crotchety old priest is a gem. Being questioned about the church’s condemnation of sinners to Hell, the priest says: “That’s all nonsense. That’s the old Catholic church.” Well, that’s good to hear!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brilliantly incorporated archived footage of political coverage, televangelists, and world events gives the presentation an extra-outrageous appeal. One of those is of Kirk Cameron and his usual spewing forth of ignorance, this time on making converts. The believer must “learn to circumvent or go around the person’s intellect.” Yep, that’s what the religious must do to convert anyone. If you think about it, it all falls apart. Don’t think! Just believe!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religious idiocy is cleverly exploited as Rabbi Schmuel Strauss is interviewed. The man works for The Institute of Science and Halacha, inventing products that allow for modern conveniences without breaking the Sabbath. A phone is showcased that can dial itself. If you put a stylus in a number of the number you want to dial, the phone will stop inhibiting dialing at the number, which it tries to do automatically every second, so as to not violate one of the 39 prohibitions set by modern Jewish leadership against pushing buttons, and therefore, allowing the use of a phone on the Sabbath. Things get more comical with a wheelchair propelled by air thrust to avoid anyone having to push it on the Sabbath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maher interviews Jose Luis De Jesus Miranda, a man with 100,000 followers worldwide who believes himself to be the second incarnation of Christ. A radical Muslim Aki Nawaz is interviewed, a man who raps about and openly believes in suicide bombings, and upholds the death threats made against Salmon Rushdie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On faith, Maher says “Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking.” And “Those who preach faith and enable it and elevate it are intellectual slaveholders.” It is religion that destroys mankind. “Religion must die for mankind to live.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conclusion is that religion is crazy – crazy funny – but mostly just crazy. Religious people are crazy. Their religion makes them that way. Religulous is about getting the world humble enough to admit that anyone can be wrong—adored religious saints and their holy books alike. If the things religious people believe were found in any other book, they’d be denied and called fairy tales. But since those things are in the Bible, they’re given a pass on conforming to rationality. None of their proponents know what they are talking about and have no more certainty in answering life’s big questions as their fellow religious loudmouths or your local “I’ll believe it when I see it” village atheist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Religulous is 100 minutes and 56 seconds of realism with comic relief where Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others all get roasted. Spliced in with the interviews are charts, facts, and movie clips that will probably have you rolling laughing. The open-minded and non-fundamentalist religionists are encouraged to see the film as it will provide great entertainment. If you are a closed-minded, straight-laced fundamentalist, run. But if you do decide to see it, be prepared to throw a shoe at the screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(JH)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

I also wish you a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2009, but not without due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make America great. Not to imply that America is necessarily greater than any other country nor the only America in the Western Hemisphere .

Ours was kind of mixed and bittersweet for reasons that I don't particularly feel like going into now, although sooner or later I will probably have to say something about it.

However, just before the holidays and shortly before I gave a certain neurosurgeon the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/dr_egnors_gone_woo.php"&gt;gift of not-so-Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came from the &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, I've said before that I try to avoid that site these days, and I do. There is nothing there other than pseudoscience, logical fallacies, and conspiracy theories about big pharma, usually laced with &lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt; attacks against skeptical and science-based bloggers like myself accompanied by whining about how the critics of the antivaccine movement are so unfair in making &lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt; attacks against the bloggers at AoA. (Never mind that the attacks usually aren't &lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt;; they're about what the AoA crew writes and how lacking in reason and evidence it is, and only sometimes about the bloggers themselves. Never mind that an &lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt; can be justified if the target's behavior warrants the &lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt;.) It all becomes tiresome after a while, and it rarely manages to appall me any more as it did in the past. I must have grown a thick skin. Even when J.B. Handley launches a childish, all out broadside, it doesn't even faze me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I saw a post by the ever-excitable and clueless Kent Heckenlively, he who makes bizarre speculations about autism science while clearly understanding nothing about it. The post is entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/i-officially-join-the-mercury-militia.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;I Officially Join the Mercury Militia&lt;/a&gt;, and it is the most horrifying thing I've seen on AoA. In fact, it's the most horrifying story of autism quackery that I've seen since the death of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/08/one_year_later_the_autopsy_results_on_ab_1.php"&gt;Tariq Nadama&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of a chelationist. All I could think as I read the post is how sorry I felt for Mr. Heckenlively's autistic daughter, whom he has subjected to all manner of quackery in the pursuit of his belief that she is "mercury toxic" and that is the cause of her autism. It also shows just how far down the rabbit hole it's possible for an otherwise intelligent person to go when that person is ignorant of science and fixates on one idea after another about what causes autism.

I'm away on vacation this week, taking my kids to Disney World. Since I'm not likely to
have time to write while I'm away, I'm taking the opportunity to re-run an old classic series
of posts on numbers, which were first posted in the summer of 2006. These posts are mildly
revised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt; I've always been perplexed by roman numerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; First of all, they're just weird. Why would anyone come up with something so strange as a
way of writing numbers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And second, given that they're so damned weird, hard to read, hard to work with, why do
we still use them for so many things today?&lt;/p&gt;

This was our second seven-fish feast of 2008, since some other friends had their traditionally non-traditional big-party version last Saturday.  Over the years, I've heard several different explanations for the fish and for the number, and a quick internet search turns up many other examples of the post hoc explanations that people routinely develop to give meaning to facts. But I've so far failed to find even a speculative answer to the sette pesci question that really interests me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the semantic speculations that are out there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://italianfood.about.com/library/weekly/blnl072.htm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;): Every year come December I begin to get requests for the &amp;quot;Seven Fishes Dinner.&amp;quot; Requests for specific menus and the symbolisms behind the dishes; to be frank, though many parts of the Peninsula, especially in the South, celebrate Christmas Eve with a fish-based dinner, the menu&amp;#39;s not that ridged […] I&amp;#39;ve been told that the seven course meal draws its inspiration from the Seven Virtues (faith, hope, charity, temperance, prudence, fortitude and justice), but there are also thirteen course meals that are inspired by Jesus and his 12 Apostles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A nice eggcorn in that one: "the menu's not that ridged", suggesting the engineering principle that folds or ridges lend stiffness to a structure.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Cooking/Traditional-Italian-Feast-of-the-Seven-Fishes.58592"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) No one knows for sure the significance for offering seven fishes, although there are numerous explanations for it. Some believe that seven fishes are served because it took God seven days to create the world, while others mention the Seven Hills of Rome. There is also the possibility that the seven fishes symbolize the seven sacraments in the Catholic Church, along with the seven sins. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PXOXQi6hAx4C"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) Why Seven Fishes? no one actually knows why the traditional dinner, on the eve before Christmas, consists of Seven Fishes but in keeping with the heritage of the southern Italian home here are some reasons or theories.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;First, one would say 'seven' stands for the Seven Sacraments and others would say its meaning goes with the Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost. For others 'seven' means the Seven Hills of Rome and for another family its meaningcomes from the days it took Mary and Joseph to travel to Bethlehem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;No matter which reason or theory you believe in, the 'Eve of Seven Fishes' was a meatless meal along the lines of meatless Fridays in accordance with the Roman Catholic beliefs for a Virgil [sic] of abstinence of show your faith in God and his teachings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Another lovely eggcorn: &amp;quot;a Virgil of abstinence&amp;quot; — perhaps to be followed on New Year&amp;#39;s Eve by a wild clergy of indulgence? ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching in Italian turned up some other theories, for example the Christian-fish-acronym hypothesis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;È un vero "must" tra gli Italo-Americani negli USA, e di certo le sue origini sono da ricercarsi nella tradizione tipica di molte regioni italiane di consumare una cena di magro la sera della Vigilia, portata con sé dai primi emigranti in cerca di fortuna.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Il pesce veniva celebrato come simbolo di fertilità sin dai tempi degli antichi romani e fu usato come simbolo dai primi cristiani per riconoscersi vicendevolmente durante la persecuzione perpetrata dai Romani nel loro confronti.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Questo perchè le lettere della parola pesce in greco antico, "ichthys" formavano le iniziali di "Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter", ovvero "Gesù Cristo Figlio di Dio Salvatore".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Il significato di cibarsene e però oggi pi collegato al sacrificio di non mangiare carne, facendo penitenza la sera del 24 in attesa della nascità' di Gesù il giorno dopo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even found some references in works of fiction, starting with Ron Liebman's "&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c779Cd1_hoEC"&gt;Death by Rodrigo&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Festa di Natale, we call it, begins with &lt;em&gt;la vigilia&lt;/em&gt;, the vigil, the feast of the seven fishes. Ends in time for midnight mass. Why seven? Lucky seven? Superstition? Well, in the old country, the northern Italian people don't do this. You've got to come from Naples on down south to Sicily to do this seven-fishes thing. Do the Sicilians, the others admit that this lucky number seven's what it looks like? No way.  Ask them, they'll tell you seven fishes at dinner are because of the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church: baptism, penance, Holy Eucharist, confirmation, marriage. I forget the rest, but let's stop for a moment on marriage. Something not in my cards, right? Oh yeah, there's also the seven sins: pride, envy, greed, lust, and some others. Lust would be a good one to spend some time on here too.  One sacrament not in the picture for me. One sin coming right up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a different vein, there's Mary Beth Caschetta's story "&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4r9CdS8DqTEC"&gt;The Seven Sacraments&lt;/a&gt;", which starts like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Last Christmas, after Maria Salerno and I cooked a different fish for each of the seven sacraments, I started believing in God again. Maybe it was my friendship with Maria and her sister, Jannette, their loud conversations, their insistence on tradition, their cheerful faith and careful food preparation. maybe my past came back to claim me: Baptism, Confession, Eucharist, Confirmation, Ordination, Matrimony, Extreme Unction. It's hard to say for sure. I used to pretend I wasn't Italian.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the story is divided into segments corresponding to pairs of sacraments and foods: baptism (linguine with clam sauce), confession (shrimp scampi), the eucharist (garlic filet of sole over lemon risotto), confirmation (mussels in white wine), ordination (shredded ginger and scung illi salad), matrimony (clams casino), and extreme unction (lobster newberg). [The puns and metaphors (marriage is a gamble, lobster newburg is extremely unctuous) are mostly left to the reader, or perhaps are entirely unintended…]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other fictional treatments, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_seven_fishes"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; offers a charming (if parochial) assertion about the geography of this tradition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There are many hypotheses for what the number &amp;quot;7″ relates to, one being the number of Sacraments in the Roman Catholic Church. Another theory is that seven is a number representing perfection: the traditional Biblical number for divinity is three, and for Earth is four, and the combination of these numbers, seven, represents God on Earth, or Jesus Christ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best seven fishes meal can be found in Holmdel, New Jersey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet there's an interesting story behind that bit of Wikipediana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nowhere in all of this did I find what I really wanted to know, which is how far back in history the sette pesci tradition goes. Did the inhabitants of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_graecia"&gt;Magna Graecia&lt;/a&gt; celebrate the winter solstice 2,500 years ago with a feast of seven fishes? Or is this a recent development, perhaps even one that crystallized within the last century among Italian immigrants in the United States?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230273155958"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/25/saturn-gets-edgy/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eab82dc7cd792cba</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="rings"/><category term="saturn"/><title type="html">Saturn gets edgy</title><published>2008-12-26T06:05:29Z</published><updated>2008-12-26T06:05:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/25/saturn-gets-edgy/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you got a telescope for Christmas/Hanukkah/Newtonmass/whatever… or you’ve had one for awhile. Either way, you get a treat this week. Or a lack of one. Saturn’s rings are going away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/html/opo9616b.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/hst_saturn_ringplane.jpg" alt="Hubble image of Saturn in 1996"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hubble caught Saturn with edge-on rings in 1996. Image courtesy Erich Karkoschka (University of Arizona Lunar &amp;amp; Planetary Lab) and NASA/ESA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, kinda. Saturn, like the Earth, is tipped a bit compared to the plane of its orbit; we’re canted at a 23.5 degree tilt, and Saturn is off from being vertical by about 26.7 degrees. Saturn’s magnificent rings are aligned with its equator, so that means that roughly twice every Saturn orbit we cross the &amp;quot;ring plane&amp;quot;. In other words, from Earth we see them edge-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rings are thin. &lt;em&gt;Incredibly&lt;/em&gt; thin. Despite being over 200,000 km across, the rings are typically at most &lt;em&gt;only a few dozen meters thick&lt;/em&gt;. To scale, that’s far thinner than a piece of paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when we pass through the plane of the rings, they practically disappear from sight. I’ve seen it once through a telescope, when we were near (but not quite at) that point, and Saturn looks pretty weird when it goes commando. We’re used to it wearing these big gaudy rings, and there it was, nearly nude. It’s maybe not the best time to show the planet off to friends and family, but it’s still pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth actually doesn’t pass through the ring plane until September 2009, but at that time Saturn will be on the other side of the Sun, and pretty much unobservable. You’d think that a month or two before then would be the best time to observe the narrowly thinning rings, but in fact the best time is right now! Due to the vagaries of our mutual orbits, the rings are actually at a minimum right now, the last week of 2008, when they are inclined just 0.8 degrees to our line of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a telescope, get out and take a look! Saturn will be nearly ringless for the next few months, and then the rings will start to open up once again. After that, you’ll have plenty of time to soak in the phenomenal view of the solar system’s best showpiece — the next ring plane crossing isn’t until March of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Saturn is in the constellation Leo and shines fairly brightly at about magnitude 1, about the same brightness as the star Regulus which marks the heart of the lion. It rises around midnight local time right now, and is high enough to observe a couple of hours later. You can find sky maps at &lt;a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/yoursky/"&gt;Your Sky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.heavens-above.com"&gt;Heavens Above&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read more about the ring plane crossing on &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/22dec_crazytilt.htm?list27315"&gt;the NASA news page&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/whats_up_astronomy/2008/12/saturn-on-edge.html"&gt;Alan Dyer’s astronomy page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have to add: this isn’t merely a curiosity; there is scientific value to this event. Telescopes can focus on the planet and see things otherwise hidden in the glare of the very bright rings. Faint moons, the existence of  material above and below the ring plane, features on Saturn itself: all these can be easier to see without the icy, reflective ring particles blasting out light. It’s funny. Saturn is the most beautiful planet in the solar system through a telescope because of those rings, but it may be the most scientifically interesting when we can’t see them at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230242599939"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/25/a-short-holiday-tweet-of-thanks/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66c335a6f7071112</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><title type="html">A short holiday tweet of thanks</title><published>2008-12-25T21:55:10Z</published><updated>2008-12-25T21:55:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/25/a-short-holiday-tweet-of-thanks/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am getting quite a few messages on Twitter (what? &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/BadAstronomer"&gt;You don’t follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;?) and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=33206428"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; from folks who got &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; for the holidays.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believed that evolution and the account of the Bible about creation could exist along side of each other very well. I just didn't see what the big argument was all about. I had some friends who had been studying the Bible much longer than I had who saw it differently...Eventually, I came to the conclusion, through my study of the Bible and science, that the two positions of evolution and creation just could not fit together. There are some real problems with the idea that God created through evolution... My prayer is that you will have this same experience!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible's picture is that dinosaurs and man lived together on the earth, an earth that was filled with
vegetation and beauty...man and dinosaurs lived at the same time...From the very beginning of creation, God gave man dominion over all that was made, even over the dinosaurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't it nice of Obama to grant this clown a prominent place on the national stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve obviously pulled yourself away from some awesome gifts, a gluttonous feeding frenzy, or a drunken argument with your family members to click on our little website today. Whatever the case, we’re glad to have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering all you’ve been through today, I’ve decided to keep the Afternoon Inquisition light and fun. You’re most probably about ready for a nap anyway, so I won’t tax your fevered brain any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for today’s A.I.:&lt;/p&gt;

In the midst of the current severe economic downturn, all segments of our society are feeling knock-on effects.  College and university endowments have taken substantial hits.  &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-alumni25-2008dec25,0,6880265.story" rel="external "&gt;We hear about the big ones&lt;/a&gt;: Harvard’s $36 billion endowment taking a 25% (at least) hit, and Yale taking (at least) a similar loss.  I say “at least” because a significant proportion of those endowments are invested in illiquid instruments for which pricing is at best chancy and at worst blind guesswork.  The “Yale model” of endowment portfolio management has been adopted by a number of institutions, and they have to be in similar trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smaller private institutions whose operating budgets are more heavily dependent on tuition are also having significant problems.  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/education/22college.html?ref=education" rel="external "&gt;Beloit College has axed 40 positions&lt;/a&gt; because of a 36-student enrollment shortfall.  My own institution, Kenyon College in Ohio, has suspended construction on several projects and has frozen hiring.  More pain is likely to come as donors retrench and parents redirect their childrens’ college choices based more on cost and less on perceived educational advantage.  And while public universities have a temporary economic advantage, that will not last as state aid is inevitably cut as a consequence of decreasing tax revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problems extend beyond that.  &lt;em&gt;Nature News&lt;/em&gt; reports that &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081223/full/news.2008.1333.html" rel="external "&gt;the Chicago Field Museum’s&lt;/a&gt; endowment has fallen by at least 36%, and it is cutting positions and reducing research support.  Its unrestricted operating budget is being cut 15% and early retirement packages are being offered to 68 people, including 15% of its scientists. Neil Shubin’s position as provost has been eliminated.  The same is happening elsewhere, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to imagine that with the massive amounts of federal bailout money already poured into financial institutions and the prospect of even more massive amounts being spent in an economic stimulus package under the incoming Obama administration, there will be a return to the good old days of the 1990s and early 2000s sometime in the not-too-far-distant future.  I think that’s a fool’s hope.  Recent U.S. economic growth has been built on a string of bubbles over the last two decades, the most recent the real estate and mortgage debt bubble, and I do not believe that there is the prospect of another stretch of bubble-based growth in the foreseeable future.  If the last two decades are interpreted as “normality,” we will not return to normality for years, if not decades.  The good times will not roll again in my lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a consequence we need to carefully think through how we will fund both science education and basic scientific research in a considerably straitened economic context.  It is not clear to me when we will have once again have the resources that we have had for the last several decades.  Nor is it clear how our research and educational institutions will adapt without cutting to the bone.  But we need to think about it and talk about it, and scientists and science supporters must be actively and effectively involved in that conversation.  We can’t sit back and passively hope for better times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Happy Monkey to all.&lt;/p&gt;

That's right, the whole Jesus thing kinda passed my by.  It's not that I have anything against your Lord, I just don't give him much thought.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except now.  This is the time of year when people wish me a Merry Christmas, then back peddle, embarrassed, as if they had just told me to perform some anatomically unlikely act on myself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I'm telling you all right now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's OK to say "Merry Christmas" to this Jew.  I realize that I'm a minority around here, and while there &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; certain things about being in a religiocultural minority that are problematic, having someone wish me a practically secular holiday greeting just doesn't rate getting me annoyed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me when I tell you that people manage to find far more offensive things to say at any time of the year.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let's remember that on this federal holiday (declared by President U.S. Grant along with New Year's Day and Independence Day to give federal employees some days off), there are a whole lot of people still working.  We may enjoy an easier drive to work (absent snow and ice), but we work just the same.  In my little bit of life, it's hospital employees who deserve special kudos.  Most of them are, as my daughter would say, "Christmas people", and have sacrificed important time to take care of sick people.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us doctors aren't Christian, but "other":  Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Jain, Druze, Ba'hai---really, you name it, we've got it. Sure, some of the doctors are Christian, but medicine is a world-wide fellowship whose identity often supercedes, or at least rests hierarchically near, religious identity.  While I'd love to spend the day watching the snow fall with my daughter, there are people at the hospital who need me, who need the nurses, techs, cooks, environmental workers, all of our hospital family.  As a non-Christian, I'm pleased to be able to give my time so that my colleagues can be home on what for them is a special day, and many of my non-Christian colleagues feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, on this holiday, remember that many of us are taking calls, auscultating chests, lancing boils, and otherwise tending to those occurances that, like me, don't recognize Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don't be afraid to wish me a Merry Christmas.  I know you mean it in a nice way.  And cookies---I like cookies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/merry_xmas_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/494890794" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230216918361"><id gr:original-id="451 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b2756e1eafb7a4e6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">What Christmas Really Means…</title><published>2008-12-25T13:07:24Z</published><updated>2008-12-25T13:07:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/451" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Christmas&lt;/b&gt;: A day when rich Westerners celebrate irrational beliefs while the rest of the planet are subjected to famine, war, disease and torture as a result of them.

have time to write while I'm away, I'm taking the opportunity to re-run an old classic series
of posts on numbers, which were first posted in the summer of 2006. These posts are mildly
revised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; After the amazing response to my post about ze ro, I thought I'd do one about something
that's fascinated me for a long time: the number &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;, the square root of -1. Where'd
this strange thing come from? Is it real (not in the sense of real numbers, but in the sense
of representing something &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; and meaningful)? What's it good for?&lt;/p&gt;

This week it included a painfully awkward message from an equally imaginary Interfaith Chaplain, struggling to find some kind of contentful and seasonal greeting that couldn't possibly offend anyone of any faith:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; You know, very soon we will be reaching that special time of the year when people who subscribe to certain religious beliefs rather than to others will be celebrating what they regard as a very significant event. May I therefore take this opportunity to wish all such believers a very happy special time of the year… &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language Log, however, is not quite so inclined to imagine that simple words of greeting will shock or disgust anyone; it seems to us that such worries are rather closely related to word taboo, with which we have little sympathy.  So it has been our custom for some years to come out quite boldly and use the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002683.html"&gt;C word&lt;/a&gt; at this season.  We love writing for you, and as time permits, in our odd moments of spare time between full-time university jobs or research projects, we will continue to do so.

It will involve no tagging, no involuntary contributions, just some cool info sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have favorite restaurants, places we can drop in for a favorite meal.  What I'm interested in is not the best gourmet places, but the best everyday places.  So, I'll share with you some of my local favorites from the NW Detroit metro area (leaving out some from earlier in my life, as I can't verify their continued existence).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.mrkabob.com/"&gt;Mr. Kabob&lt;/a&gt;, in Berkley, MI.  This place rocks.  It's in a damned gas station, but they cook up some wickedly good and cheap mideastern carry out (and you can eat there if you don't mind the comings and goings of the gas patrons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a href="http://metrotimes.com/food/review.asp?rid=21270"&gt;Redcoat Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, Birmingham, MI.  This cramped, dark, smoky spot is well-known for one of the best burgers in Michigan.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;a href="http://www.roadfood.com/Reviews/Overview.aspx?RefID=1173"&gt;Juilleret's&lt;/a&gt;, Charlevoix, MI.  I dare you---I double dog dare you---to find a better breakfast.  The french toast is incomparable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;a href="http://www.stevesdeli.com/menus/index.html#sandwiches"&gt;Steve's Deli&lt;/a&gt;, Bloomfield Hills, MI:  Detroit has great delis.  Really, New York, you guys are pitiful.  You must have a #4 (corned beef, swiss cheese, coleslaw on rye with russian dressing)---it's a classic Detroit deli sandwich.  (Yes, Star Deli is better, but it's takeout only.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Athens Coney Island, Birmingham, MI:  Coney Islands are Detroit diners.  They are often Greek-owned, and have lots of classic Greek specialties, but what they all share in common is the Coney, a natural casing hot dog in a steamed bun with chili sauce (not chili).  You gotta do it. (Yes, Lafayette and American are the classics, but how often do you really go to downtown Detroit, even if you live here?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go ahead and tell us your favorite hometown eateries---we want to know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/sciencefree_holiday_postfood.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/494389767" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230156187759"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/24/hello-my-name-is-inigo-skywalker/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b9c1538e289f101b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Hello.

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t.” said Scrooge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What evidence would you have of my reality, beyond that of your senses?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” said Scrooge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why do you doubt your senses?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this story. It’s one of my favorite Christmas traditions to watch various versions of this - &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104940/"&gt;A Muppet Christmas Carol&lt;/a&gt;, Bill Murray’s &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096061/"&gt;Scrooged&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="http://www.shakespearetavern.com/"&gt;Atlanta Shakespeare Tavern’s&lt;/a&gt; Dickensian narration of A Christmas Carol. I went to that last one this week and it was during the piece of dialog above that it dawned on me. Scrooge was a skeptic! I leaned over and whispered this  minor epiphany to my husband who responded “That’s what most people think of when they think of skeptics, I’ll bet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that got me thinking some more. So Scrooge was a skeptic. He didn’t believe in ghosts, even when confronted with them, realizing that human senses could play tricks. But to say that all skeptics are, as Dickens describes old Ebenezer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… a tight-fisted hand at the grind- stone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no no no, my friends. Not so. You all probably know this already but I think it needs to be said. Calling all skeptics Scrooge is sort of an argument ad hominem. Or maybe a bad syllogism. Scrooge was a skeptic. Scrooge was mean and cold-hearted. Therefore, all skeptics are mean and cold-hearted. (Moreover, he stopped beinga big ol’ bastard when he stopped being a skeptic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see very few Scrooges in the skeptical community. And it is a community. People debate whether it should be called a movement or a way of thinking or an activity, but you can’t deny we’re a community. It’s comprised of some of the kindest, funniest, smartest and noblest people I’ve ever known. But we’re all skeptics. We need evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my favorite examples from the year gone by about what skeptics are and what we do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We worry about our children and our future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When education is at risk around the country and around the world, skeptics are there to be the voice of reason. We worry when creationists are &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/01/louisiana-doomed/"&gt;elected into state government&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/03/who_votes_for_these_gomers.php"&gt;concerned that science program&lt;/a&gt;s everywhere will suffer.  And we continue to be vigilant as &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4408"&gt;school boards question teaching evolution&lt;/a&gt; time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We work to help our fellow man (and woman)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptical groups &lt;a href="http://www.acahf.org.au/"&gt;around&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://www.indianrationalists.blogspot.com/"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; spend time, money and energy &lt;a href="http://www.radfordbooks.com"&gt;debunking the myths&lt;/a&gt; and publicising the truth about &lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt; that will &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/"&gt;hurt people&lt;/a&gt;. Others try to demonstrate the dangers of pseudoscience through &lt;a href="http://www.whatstheharm.net"&gt;research and reason&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, we worry about strangers and friends alike, who can fall prey to misinformation and fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We fight for human freedoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When, in the midst of a world-changing election, basic human freedom was stripped away from homosexuals in California, Florida and Arkansas, the skeptical community spoke out and continues to speak out. We &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4156"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/6971/other-reactions-to-rick-warren/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; and we &lt;a href="http://www.amateurscientist.org/2008_11_01_archive.html"&gt;podcasted &lt;/a&gt;in support of gay rights and we will continue to do so. Because freedom for only some means freedom for none. We get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We take care of each other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our dear friend and all around cool skeptic &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=2131"&gt;Robert Lancaster suffered a stroke&lt;/a&gt; this year, we all did our best to support him. Some donated money, others donated time, others sent well wishes and messages of support in the hopes of a speedy recovery. Some of the people who supported him had never even met Robert, but knew him through the &lt;a href="http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=120873"&gt;JREF forums&lt;/a&gt; or the work he did against &lt;a href="http://www.stopsylvia.com/"&gt;Sylvia Browne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we found out his &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4118"&gt;site URL had been taken over&lt;/a&gt; by squatters, folks on the JREF forum fell over themselves to remedy the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We love to laugh, to socialize and to meet new people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhh the parties. 2008 was quite the year for parties. One and a half &lt;a href="http://randi.org/site/index.php/amazing-meeting.html"&gt;Amaz!ng Meetings&lt;/a&gt;plus an Amaz!ng Adventure to the &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=3036"&gt;Galapagos&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=2653"&gt;Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt;! Skepchicks in &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1847"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4654"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;! Oh the people we met and the parties we threw. Plus, Skeptics in the Pub and Drinking Skeptically &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1062/"&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; have popped up all over the place. People are realizing that being a skeptic isn’t about staying home and eating gruel. Oh no, not when there’s beer to be drunk and friends to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We celebrate Christmas in our own, unique ways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we’re believers or not, most of us find a way to appreciate the spirit of the Christmas season. We shop, we give gifts, we think about our families, our friends and the people closest to us. We celebrate the traditions we want to, we &lt;a href="http://minnesotaindependent.com/20980/religious-right-watch-the-war-on-christmas"&gt;laugh at folks&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/teen/?p=560"&gt;take the season too seriously&lt;/a&gt; and we try to live our lives with generosity, peace and goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my skeptical friends, if you do get called a Skeptical Scrooge this Christmas, I’d say people must be referring to the Scrooge at the end of the story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrooge was better than his word…He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas ya’ll! Have some ‘nog and eat a cookie. You deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Masala Skeptic</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230149112458"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4929">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1ba79726e68f0230</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 12.24.08</title><published>2008-12-24T20:00:20Z</published><updated>2008-12-24T20:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4929" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4f278303ec34c4603662c97a63533b8c&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this era of political correctness, many find it safest to say “Happy Holidays” as opposed to “Merry Christmas”.  But most of the components of the holiday are rooted in pagan rituals, and Christmas has become so commercialized that most of the traditions have little to do with the birth of Jesus.  Even Richard Dawkins &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/weekinreview/17kennedy.html?_r=2&amp;amp;ref=weekinreview&amp;amp;oref=slogin&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;has a Chrismas tree and asserts that the holiday has become so divorced from religion that he says “Merry Christmas” without hesitation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s much discussion about &lt;a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/christmasholidayseason/p/AtheistsIgnore.htm"&gt;what, if any, holiday non-theists should celebrate&lt;/a&gt;.  And Christians are sometimes offended when non-theists celebrate Christmas, despite Christianity’s late appropriation of the winter solstice festivities.  However, in light of the source of the December celebration, the proliferation of Santa Claus tales, and the focus on food, presents, and merriment (as opposed to the birth of Christ), it may actually be the most appropriate holiday for non-theists to observe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is Christmas still a religious holiday?  Or does its origin and recent commercialization render the religious component “optional”?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stacey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230147928716"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-6706516963178213899">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0152ddf7b03b4433</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="homeopathy" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="NHS" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="mistletoe" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Mistletoe and Cancer</title><published>2008-12-24T19:30:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-24T19:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/12/mistletoe-and-cancer.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Le Canard Noir)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.quackometer.net/blog/rss.xml</id><title type="html">the quackometer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230147167235"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/a_merry_american_christmas.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62fc12fd7b6ae52e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Entertainment"/><title type="html">A Merry American Christmas</title><published>2008-12-24T19:00:20Z</published><updated>2008-12-24T19:00:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/494257027/a_merry_american_christmas.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/a_merry_american_christmas.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If Bill O&amp;#39;Reilly ever gets a Christmas special, he&amp;#39;ll need an opening musical number…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/simonsingh.jpg" alt="Simon Singh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/"&gt;Simon Singh&lt;/a&gt; is a skeptic in the UK, and a well-known science writer. He coauthored a book called &lt;em&gt;Trick or Treament, Alternative Medicine on Trial&lt;/em&gt; basically lambasting many forms of chiropractic as pseudoscience — this is the idea that somehow realigning your spine can fix all sorts of ailments, from toothaches to asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote in article in the UK newspaper The Guardian about this, and the British Chiropractic Association, unsurprisingly, took some exception to it. In fact, they sued him for libel. That lawsuit has been going on for some time, and you can find details by &lt;a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;amp;q=simon+singh+bca&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Blogs"&gt;searching Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that Singh could have simply argued that what he said was a free speech comment (or the UK equivalent), which is what’s usually done in these kinds of cases. That lets the paper off the hook, and everyone is happy… though it could be argued there is something of a chilling effect for journalists, who might be afraid to be sued again. But it’s an easy solution that gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it doesn’t look like that’s what Singh is doing– &lt;a href="http://draust.wordpress.com/2008/12/23/it%E2%80%99s-quiet%E2%80%A6-too-quiet/"&gt;he and his legal support have turned the tables on the BCA&lt;/a&gt;, and are saying that in fact what Singh wrote is true: a lot of chiropractic practices are bogus pseudoscientific quackery. This is beautiful, &lt;em&gt;as it forces the BCA to defend what it does in a court of law&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, this goes from a simple libel case to one where an entire sector of garbage &amp;quot;alternative medicine&amp;quot; has to prove what it does is &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details to me aren’t clear; in America I have little doubt that a group like the BCA could bring forward three witnesses who say their cold symptoms went away just three days after having their spines adjusted, and a jury would award the chiropractors a bazillion dollars. But the UK has different laws, and I suspect if Singh is taking this strategic route, he’ll be well-prepared for such a tactic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire skeptical community will be watching this case very closely, I assure you. This could potentially be huge, bigger than the Dover creationism trial. I would so dearly love to see medical quackery get the justice it oh-so deserves. Most pseudoscience has subtle ramifications, but &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/chiropractic.html"&gt;alternative medicine quackery hurts and even kills people&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

have time to write while I'm away, I'm taking the opportunity to re-run an old classic series

revised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This post originally came about as a result of the first time I participated in
a DonorsChoose fundraiser.  I offered to write articles on requested topics for anyone who donated above a certain amount. I only had one taker, who asked for an
article about zero. I was initially a bit taken aback by the request - what could I write
about &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;? This article which resulted from it ended up turning out to be one of the all-time reader-favorites for this blog!&lt;/p&gt;

They got a bunch of people to send snarky and sarcastic messages about how they’re contributing to The War. I show up at 24:40. And hey: the podcast itself is pretty much wall-to-wall NSFW. There’s some stuff that’ll offend a lot of people, of course, but also some pretty adult conversations about gift giving.

Christians must defend too many beliefs, any one of which, if incorrect, would be fatal to their whole worldview. These beliefs are based upon the conclusions of historical evidence which is extremely problematic given the nature of that evidence. Then they have the additional problem of showing why these historical conclusions are supported by science (as in creation research) and can be made sense of by philosophy. But the historical evidence alone defeats their set of beliefs! I claim Christians do not believe the Bible! They gerrymander and cherry-pick from it over and over. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians will respond, like one scholarly friend of mine did, that it’s “far from obvious” he should look at his beliefs as an outsider. But then what does he tell Mormon scholars who might say the same thing as Alvin Plantinga does, that they don’t have to investigate their faith or Scriptures with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)#Methodological_and_Metaphysical_Naturalism"&gt;methodological naturalism&lt;/a&gt; (it is, after all, only a method unlike ontological naturalism)? What if they maintained they are within their epistemic rights to base their science (and archaeology) on their own worldview? Why the double standard here? And why is it that methodological naturalism has made this modern world possible, achieving astounding results from the computer chip to the internet to modern medicine to forensics to meteorology to plate tectonics to nuclear technology, and so on and so forth, but that when it comes to investigating an ancient collection of superstitious writings with obvious pseudonymous interpolations that we shouldn’t apply that extremely fruitful method to those writings? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friend asked if God is to be blamed for creating this world and for wanting people who freely love him. Yes, most definitely yes, until or unless he can tell me why a supposedly reasonable triune completely self-fulfilled God wanted this in the first place (“grace” is not an answer at all); why libertarian free-will is such an important value to God when compared to the sufferings that have resulted from this so-called gift; whether human beings actually have free-will if God created us with our specific DNA and placed us within a specific environment (an environment that actually obstructs many people from receiving the gospel because of the “accidents of birth”); why God suspends some people’s free choices (i.e. Pharaoh) but not others; why God even cares to have free-willed people who love him, knowing full well the consequences for the billions of people who wind up in hell (the collateral damage), and why God will allow sinners in hell to retain their freedom but take it away from the saints in heaven (and who subsequently completes the sanctification process for these saints without their own free choices doing it). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to Jesus, my friend directed me to Boyd/Eddy’s excellent book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Legend-Historical-Reliability-Tradition/dp/0801031141/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1230130585&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;The Jesus Legend&lt;/a&gt;. That first chapter makes some unique arguments. The authors argue when it comes to the historical past that to be truly critical we should be open to everything—that "everything is fair game"--since anything might be possible. In making this argument they claim we should be open to the possibility of the miracles in the Bible. But I find that position to be impossible and extremely gullible. No, of course not, everything cannot be fair game, otherwise historians would fall prey to every claim of a statue of the Virgin Mary that wept, and every medieval claim that witches flew through the night to have orgies with Satan (should we really be open to these claims?). No, historians must look at the past from the perspective of the present--the one they know. In fact, they cannot do otherwise, Boyd and Eddy included. Boyd and Eddy read the Bible through modern eyes too. That’s why I claim Christians in today's world don’t believe the Bible. They don’t, not by a long shot. They have merely reinterpreted it over and over again in light of the advancement of scientific, philosophical, economical, political, and social understandings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When will Christians see this for what it is? When will they actually think about what they're saying? When will they actually answer my arguments? Nothing, and I mean nothing, has come close to truly engaging them. They have faith, therefore I must be wrong. Really? *shrugs his shoulders* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

These fallacies aren't just rhetorical toys to play with in the blogosphere.  They can be simple mistakes made when discussing an controversy, or they can be weapons used in place of a valid argument.  They are particularly important when dealing with reality.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reality.  I'm not talking about a stoned, midnight bull session about whether dialectical materialism accurately describes the relationships between groups of people, or other such (sometimes interesting) nonsense.

&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;a href="http://blog.evangelicalrealism.com"&gt;a great blogger out there&lt;/a&gt; who is fond of repeating the fact that "the truth is consistent with itself."  Sure, we can argue the philosophy of reality, truth, perception all day and night, but in the end, in the real, practical world (the one doctors deal with), the truth is consistent with itself, and &lt;a href="http://blog.evangelicalrealism.com/2007/07/13/hello-world/"&gt;reality is that which we can observe&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://droneteam.com/history/raj/PICT16.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/ufo_drone.jpg" alt="UFO drone over California"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pictures made me laugh. I have always said the best UFO shots were always fuzzy, but here was one in very crisp super-hi-res detail. I laughed because this was so obviously a hoax. It’s a good one, sure, but the thing is, it looked to me like what a Hollywood special effects guy would build to &lt;em&gt;look like&lt;/em&gt; an alien craft, as opposed to what one would &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; look like. I mean, right down to the Klingon-esque script on it. Totally cool, and well done, but it really rang my hoax-alarm. I never really talked about it on the blog because I figured, correctly, it would blow over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it did, but now it’s back… but not in the way you’d think. It looks very much like &lt;a href="http://io9.com/5117028/your-ufos-are-just-viral-marketing"&gt;this whole thing was a viral marketing scheme for &amp;quot;The Sarah Conner Chronicles&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, the TV series about Terminators. The long time between the &amp;quot;sightings&amp;quot; and the show would be due to the writers’ strike. And of course, the whole TV look to the drones would then make a lot more sense, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hasn’t been verified yet, but it looks pretty clear. You can read more at &lt;a href="http://screenrant.com/sarah-connor-chronicles-california-drones-mystery-brusimm-4647/"&gt;Screen Rant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, it's all supposed to be Peace On Earth, Good Will Towards Men (and Women), and all that jazz. Really, that's exactly what I had intended for today and tomorrow. Indeed, my plan was to do nothing more than a quickie post today and a maybe a couple of brief (and hopefully amusing) Christmas-related posts this afternoon and tomorrow. Really, I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it came, and it came from a direction that I least expected. Yes, yet another "old friend" of the blog had to go and and not just ask but &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;beg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for a heapin' helpin' of not-so-Respectful Insolence. My readers know that I seldom turn down such heartfelt requests. I may be cranky, arrogant, and cantankerous, but I'm a benevolent box of blinking lights, and it is Christmas Eve. That creationist neurosurgeon with a love of pseudoscience and logical fallacies, that surgeon who embarrasses me with his frequent fusillades of misinformation about evolution, so much so that I have joked about wearing either a paper bag or a Doctor Doom mask to hide my face, that man with a knack for perseverating about the same misinformation over and over and over again no matter how many times he is corrected, Dr. Egnor, has gone off the deep end again, launching a direct frontal assault against me and fellow skeptical and science-based physician &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog"&gt;Dr. Steve Novella&lt;/a&gt;. My Christmas present to him is to give him the not-so-Respectful Insolence that he's clearly asking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you'd probably expect that, as usual, Dr. Egnor's broadside would be about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/the_energizer_bunny_of_antievolution_1.php"&gt;evolution&lt;/a&gt; (replete with his repetitive perseveration that the "only contribution" that "Darwinism" has ever made to medicine is eugenics) or about dualism and his belief that the physical brain and central nervous system are &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=438"&gt;insufficient to explain the mind&lt;/a&gt;. Most recently, he was &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/facepalm_thy_name_is_dr_egnor.php"&gt;going on and on&lt;/a&gt; about how he has taught medical students for decades and how his experience as a physician and in clinical practice allows him to "recognize B.S." when he sees it, in this case the claim that evolutionary biology contributes to medical advances. My words at the time (a mere two weeks ago) now seem prescient:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/dr_egnors_gone_woo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/dr_egnors_gone_woo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/494080988" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230128602579"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4925">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/eb7ac7af4ae33ec8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 12.24</title><published>2008-12-24T13:29:33Z</published><updated>2008-12-24T13:29:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4925" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;___________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science-based medicine is more than a website. It is a philosophy of medicine that is actively vying with other philosophies for dominance in the world of medicine. We believe that medicine should be based upon the best science available, according to a single universal standard of rigorous methodology and valid logic and reason. Others desire a double-standard, so that they can be free to practice or market whatever they wish without having to meet strict scientific standards. Still others have a non-scientific ideological world-view and want public policy to accord to, or at least admit, their personal beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore expect that we will be attacked by proponents of unscientific medicine in all its forms.  Yesterday, however, we were attacked on the &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/12/advice_to_an_arrogant_medical.html#more"&gt;Evolution News &amp;amp; Views&lt;/a&gt; website of the Discovery Institute by creationist neurosurgeon, Michael Egnor. This may seem incongruous at first, but honestly I suspected that just such an attack was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many science bloggers, David Gorski and me prominent among them, have taken on both the DI and Dr. Egnor specifically over many anti-scientific arguments he has put forward over the last couple of years. We have sparred mostly about evolution in medicine, neuroscience and consciousness, and the materialist underpinnings of modern science. Dr Egnor’s day job, however, is that of a (from what I can tell) respected neurosurgeon, so I always wondered what he thought of his sparring partners’ writings about science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His entry yesterday ends any speculation - he wrote an incoherent, logical fallacy-ridden screed that would make any snake-oil peddler proud. This reinforces a point I have made in other contexts - all anti-scientific philosophies have science as a common enemy, and will tend to band together in an “unholy alliance” against those advocating for scientific rigor or defending science from ideological attack. That is why a website that is ostensibly about the “misreporting of the evolution issue” would post a blog attacking science-based medicine as an “arrogant medical priesthood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Straw Man, False Dichotomy, Non Sequitur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of Dr. Egnor’s claim is a trifecta of logical fallacies. He writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a supporter of “alternative medicine,” and I objected when an effort was made some years ago to expand alternative medicine here at Stony Brook. Alternative medicine, like traditional medicine, must be subjected to strict standards of evidence for safety and efficacy. Most types of alternative medicine fail to meet those standards, and therefore should not be endorsed by the medical profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there is an irony in the efforts of “defenders of science” to protect the public from treatments and theories that are outside of the mainstream of medical practice. The greatest iatrogenic danger to patients isn’t chiropractors or homeopaths or vaccine “deniers.” It’s the doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel working in the traditional medical paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Egnor has clearly not read enough of our writings, or has not made an effort to fairly understand them, to accurately summarize them. He has earned a reputation as a sloppy thinker and poor scholar for this behavior. Note that he must agree with what we actually do - advocate for “strict standards of evidence for safety and efficacy.” But he wants to find some way to criticize his ideological foes, so the logical fallacies begin. First he constructs a straw man - that our goal is to protect the public from “treatments and theories that are outside of the mainstream of medical practice.” He develops this theme further when he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that much of the motivation for the “pro-science” priesthood isn’t patient safety or a genuine respect for scientific method but ideological hegemony. What bothers materialist ideologues like Novella and Orac is that there are people who challenge their materialist scientific worldview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any honest reading of Science-Based Medicine, NeuroLogica, or Respectful Insolence gives lie to this claim, which is no different than the accusations we have heard from homeopaths, energy healers, and charlatans of all stripes. We have clearly written that our purpose is to promote rigorous scientific methodology in medicine. We talk about method, and the targets of our criticism misinterpret this (deliberately or otherwise) as closed-minded “ideological hegemony.” But all we are really saying is that a specific claim does not meet the standards of science and evidence, and that we feel a single science-based standard of care should apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Egnor’s straw man is well known to us because we have heard it from proponents of unscientific medicine for years.  We might argue, for example, that a particular acupuncture study is unblinded and therefore cannot exclude the placebo effect as solely responsible for the outcome. We may also challenge that proponents of acupuncture have yet to propose of scientifically plausible mechanism for their claims. Defenders of acupuncture often counter with the non sequitur that we are biased against acupuncture because it is outside the mainstream and challenges our “materialism.” This does not address our criticisms, however. Such rejoinders are meant as a diversion - to draw attention away from the fact that a particular claim lacks evidence or plausibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proponents of unscientific medicine also rely upon a false dichotomy - that between “mainstream” and “alternative” medicine. The purpose of the double standard is to deflect criticism while simultaneously carving out a double standard for claims that don’t meet the usual standard. We have also been very clear that our goal is to return to a single standard of care in medicine based upon good science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is that Dr. Egnor can commit the same non sequitur right on the heels of admitting that what we actually do is legitimate. The cognitive dissonance must be deafening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tu Quoque&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To defend his self-contradictory position Dr. Egnor must create a fiction that he can then criticize - that we aim our criticism outside of mainstream medicine but not within it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The harm done by traditional practitioners of medicine is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Where is the introspection by “skeptics” and “science defenders” like Drs. Novella and Orac about the enormous harm done to patients by &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; — traditional medical practitioners? What hypocrites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This again is based upon a false dichotomy that we are trying to dispel, not promote. We apply the scientific standards we advocate to all of medicine, not just those “outside the mainstream.” It is a point we hammer home over and over, to the point where one must be willfully ignorant to miss it. “Where is the introspection” - one does not have to look far to find it, and so clearly Dr. Egnor did not do his homework (again, true to his reputation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just last week I wrote about the abuse of the term “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=315"&gt;syndrome&lt;/a&gt;” in medicine. I did not discriminate according to any false dichotomy about what is inside our outside accepted medicine. I discussed, for example, heavy leg syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome, both diagnoses accepted within “mainstream” medicine. &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?author=4"&gt;I have discussed&lt;/a&gt; the use of off-label medications, how to interpret the clinical literature, conflict of interest in the medical literature, and the debate about anti-depressant efficacy. David Gorski has written about transparency in clinical trials, barriers to practicing science-based surgery, and when the popularity of new surgical procedures outpaces the evidence. Mark Crislip has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=60"&gt;sharply criticized our own profession&lt;/a&gt; for the acceptance of pharmaceutical company lunches and other perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim by Dr. Egnor that we do not address issues of science or quality control within our own profession is not only a false dichotomy and a non sequitur, it is patently false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course we do spend the majority of our attention dealing with the most anti-scientific challenges to modern medicine. It only stands to reason that proponents of science-based medicine would spend the majority of their energy attacking the most outrageous unscientific medicine that has managed to infiltrate health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus also stems from the fact that this is a niche that we perceive is empty. We are pointing out that the emperor has no clothes because no one else is. The institutions of academia and medicine have been cowed by false notions of political correctness. The AMA was cowed by a successful restraint of trade lawsuit by chiropractors. The mainstream media are worse than useless - they are abetting the spread of pseudoscience. Promoting universal standards of science in medicine and directing our efforts at the worst abusers is our chosen mission. It is a mindless non sequitur (one that we are also familiar with from the proponents of unscientific medicine) to argue that we should be doing something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk vs Benefit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to Dr. Egnor’s other claim - that “mainstream” medicine causes more harm than so-called “alternative” medicine. Dr. Egnor would have done well to first read Harriet’s excellent commentary on this claim. She points out the fallacy of focusing only on harm and not on benefit. Medicine (as any respectable clinician should know) is about risk vs benefit. Focusing on just risk gives a very distorted view of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course medical mistakes harm more people than so-called alternative medicine - because mainstream medicine is orders of magnitude larger than alternative practice, and often deals with much more acutely ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Egnor focuses on hand washing and medical errors. Why, he wonders, are we not taking on these issues. As stated above, we do in that we advocate for science-based practices across the board. But also, reducing medical mistakes, while very important, is simply not our chosen focus. There are already institutions and systems in place that are working diligently on these problems. In fact, most physicians in academia will serve in some capacity in such efforts as part of their administrative duties. I sit on a credentialing committee that deals with these issues. Mark Crislip tells me he has spent most of his career directly involved in exactly these quality control issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Dr. Egnor’s core claim is just another non sequitur and false premise. He might as well say we are hypocrites for not taking on insurance fraud. Don’t we care about tax payer money being lost due to physicians committing Medicare fraud? What about our colleagues who sexually abuse their patients? Of course we care - it’s simply not the mission of science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that Dr. Egnor misses the boat on these quality control issues. He casually blames arrogance (because it is an easy accusation to throw around). I will admit that there may be a kernel of truth to the notion that personal physician arrogance contributes to poor compliance and medical mistakes. I have never argued that as a profession we are beyond reproach. In fact I often go out of my way to point out that there is much to criticize in mainstream medicine and there are individual physicians who lack compassion, ethics, competence, or all three. (None of which, of course, justifies any particular unscientific claim.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the solution to quality control issues is not to rail against arrogance, it is to focus on systems. Those who are actually engaged directly in quality control issues in medicine have learned that you cannot just preach to health care providers about hand washing and diligence. You do need to do this - but the best results occur when systems are put into place that make compliance easy and automatic. Simply placing hand washing gel dispensers outside every patient room did more to raise hand washing compliance than nagging ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues are being effectively addressed within medicine.  One of the barriers to efforts to deal with these concerns have been unscientific thinking among our own colleagues. This is not an insurmountable barrier - but we do encounter poor logic and faulty reasoning everywhere. In fact I have argued that making a study of the worst examples of pseudoscience helps me recognize more subtle manifestations of sloppy thinking. Studying pseudoscience makes one a better scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Nice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Egnor’s blog entry also includes this gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are beset by an arrogant medical and scientific priestcraft, eager to call ordinary people “idiots” or “anti-science” or “deniers” because they hold viewpoints with which these particular scientists and physicians disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the “&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=58"&gt;Attack on Mommies&lt;/a&gt;” gambit that RFK Jr. used to defend his anti-vaccine claims. Again, Dr. Egnor is simply not paying attention, or he doesn’t care. I have written specifically &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=161"&gt;about how to talk to patients&lt;/a&gt; who have unscientific ideas. This is an issue about which we are very thoughtful, as it cuts to the heart of what we do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We in fact have made a specific point not to attack patients or “ordinary people” for holding unscientific views. We have even likened this to “blaming the victim” - we see a scientifically illiterate public as a victim of poor education, a credulous media, and anti-scientific propaganda. We do, however, sharply criticize those who publicly defend or promote pseudoscience or attack science or scientific medicine. We try, in fact, to focus our criticism on their claims and methods and avoid ad hominem attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you enter the public debate on a topic by writing about it, speaking about it, and actively promoting a point of view - then you open yourself and your views up to criticism. You cannot then whine about being criticized by those who disagree with your point of view. That’s the whole point of public discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public criticism is also part of the culture of science. Science’s chief strength as a self-corrective system depends largely on open criticism. Scientific discourse, while it can be polite and professional, is also a take-no-prisoners meat grinder. Anyone who has ever attended a scientific conference has likely seen this first hand. Bad ideas are excoriated, as they should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This latest entry by Dr. Egnor, true to his form, is an incoherent hodge podge of logical fallacies and contradiction. It is also based on a gross and unfair misrepresentation of the proponents of science-based medicine, as can clearly be demonstrated by what we have actually written on this site over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is further evidence that those who seek to undermine the integrity of science in order to promote their personal ideology will find common cause, despite even vast internal ideological differences. That is why Dr. Egnor can agree with our actual position with regard to unscientific medicine, but be so motivated to find something to criticize that he ends up making the same dubious arguments as the proponents of unscientific medicine he claims to oppose. This is why an attack on the defenders of science-based medicine can be found on a creationist website.&lt;/p&gt;

So as I notice notice relevant examples in publications like archived radio shows, I've been documenting them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of other examples turned up yesterday, in a "Radio Gift" segment on NPR's Day to Day program: "&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98638768"&gt;Dr. Boots Tries A No-Insurance Model&lt;/a&gt;", about Elizabeth Crowley, a doctor in New Jersey who decided to stop taking health insurance payments. (There's more background &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/daydreaming/2008/12/radio_gift_dr_boots.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the featured doctor also has a &lt;a href="http://bootscrowley.blogspot.com/"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; that's well worth reading.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first set of final rises comes in a passage where Dr. Crowley explains why she wears boots to work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;So when I was in medical school /&lt;br&gt;
I tried to wear like the regular um&lt;br&gt;
       flat like girl shoes /&lt;br&gt;
and uh my foot started hurting —&lt;br&gt;
and so it's really a comfort issue/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
A bit later, there's an audio clip from one of Dr. Crowley's patients, in which two phrases with final rises are followed by a series of final falls:
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;She doesn't wear a uniform that establishes a kind of um barrier /&lt;br&gt;
between herself and her patients /&lt;br&gt;
you just feel a rapport \&lt;br&gt;
as a result of something as small as that, or \&lt;br&gt;
what sounds small is actually very large. \&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DrBoots4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DrBoots4.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other clips of Dr. Crowley, later in the segment, where there's no uptalk at all, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a completely different topic, I recommend one of Dr. Crowley's blog posts ("&lt;a href="http://bootscrowley.blogspot.com/2008/11/can-you-blame-them.html"&gt;Can you blame them?&lt;/a&gt;", 11/20/2008), which includes this widely-applicable suggestion: "When looking at the changes in the healthcare plan, we must ABSOLUTELY NOT lose sight of the fact that if we do not simplify this process it will not work."&lt;/p&gt;

This one, related to Chris Potts' post "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=944"&gt;Probably they shouldn't&lt;/a&gt;", was typical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Actual speaks of language have no problems with antecedents. They are completly un-noteworthy, and I don't understand why people make posts about these un-noteworthy language events on here. If Obama's slogan was "Yes, Fred can!" with no common perception of who the hell Fred is, that would be noteworthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For those who are interested in why linguists have found verb phrase ellipsis interesting, I can recommend some earlier LL posts, in addition to the one that Chris helpfully linked to in the post that set Tarlach off: "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003983.html"&gt;VPE on the edge&lt;/a&gt;", 12/28/2006; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004522.html"&gt;News from the further reaches of Ellipsilandia&lt;/a&gt;", 5/23/2007; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005043.html"&gt;More fun with VPE&lt;/a&gt;", 10/20/2007; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005200.html"&gt;Dual VPE&lt;/a&gt;", 12/10/2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it still puzzles you why people should spend time trying to explain the structure and function of phrases that pass unnoticed in &amp;quot;actual speaks of language&amp;quot;, I invite you think about the broader role of &amp;quot;completely un-noteworthy&amp;quot; things in scientific investigation: light, heat, day, night, breathing, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't approve Tarlach's comments, but comments are open on this post, if (s)he'd like to try again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230118913813"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-432209269087306517">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9b9a9df2c4552e47</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meatspace" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Action" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bullshit" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Storytime" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Skepticism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Action Skeptics Storytime: The Road</title><published>2008-12-24T06:58:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-24T06:58:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/12/action-skeptics-storytime-road.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;b&gt;Prologue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;This past weekend was the weekend of my family Christmas party on my dad's side. The upside is I hadn't seen most of those people for at least a year. The downside is that the gathering was seven hours away in Ohio. So I decided that it was finally time to check out that whole "podcast" thing that all the kids are talking about these days. I downloaded some Skeptic's Guide to the Universe, some Questionable Content from Penny Arcade, some Smodcast from Kevin Smith, and some Skeptoid, slammed them onto my iPod Touch, and hit the road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My car is awesome enough that I can plug my iPod into it, so I listened through the first leg of the journey, to my dad's house, and I found I couldn't get enough Skeptoid. I highly recommend Brian Dunning's &lt;a href="http://skeptoid.com"&gt;Skeptoid&lt;/a&gt; podcast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the two-and-a-half days I was out of town involved a greater-than-usual amount of applied skepticism. I thought I'd recount it for posterity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chapter 1: My Brother's Muscles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My little brother is ripped. He's also very small. Maybe 5'8" and wiry. He's like a tiny little Bad Pitt. The ladies love it, and so he cultivates it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My dad is also ripped. And not just ripped. &lt;i&gt;Humongous&lt;/i&gt;. He's been a weight-lifter since high school. He's in his 50s and looks maybe 35. Maybe. He's also not much of a critical thinker, so he'll try just about anything to see if it'll help him get a little more out of his workouts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My brother tries, and his bullshit detector is growing, but he's still got a ways to go. Thus it was that my dad recommended to him some new pill or powder or something-or-other that was &lt;i&gt;guaranteed&lt;/i&gt; to build you more muscle, faster. I can't recall the name of this magical compound, but my brother had begun using it and had seen results, and he told me all about it Friday evening at my mother's house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Dude, seriously, I've gotten so much bigger just since I started using it. Look."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw no appreciable difference from the last time I had seen him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Where's the studies?" I inquired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Huh?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I'm not going to take some supplement until someone's done their homework. Just saying it works isn't enough; they have to test the stuff." It's hard not to use phrases like "post hoc, ergo propter hoc" in real life, but I make do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well, I know..." he said. "But Dad uses it!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"So?" I replied. "Dad used to use colloidal silver. That does jack shit and turns you blue."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Nuh-uh."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sure does." Luckily, I had an ace in the hole on this one. His friend the obsessed pre-med student was there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"[Chimpy], doesn't colloidal silver do jack shit and turn you blue?" I yelled into the other room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yup!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My brother's face became confused-looking. "Man, that's weird."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yup," I replied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chapter 2: Ice and Shadow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;My dad's house is way out in the country, a ranch-style affair in a crisscross of little backwater county routes, the kind of roads that have numbers instead of names. There's little and less out there save farmland and power lines. One thing that is conspicuously absent on a late night is even a single goddamned streelamp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There I was, running on almost thirty hours of wakefulness (that's what happens when you work third shift but try to have a normal schedule for a holiday weekend), at almost midnight, driving around these roads in the pitch blackness on the way to my dad's house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did I mention that these are the kind of roads that only see a plow if it's being pulled by a tractor? That only see salt if someone accidentally spills a shaker?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many of my American readers are probably well aware of the ice storm that hit the Mid this past weekend. It was waning as I drove to my dad's place, but a waning ice storm in Sticksville, Indiana is still quite annoying, to say the least. The roads were all quite slick, and the only light I had was coming from my headlamps, which, as every driver knows, are often kind of worthless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, I took a wrong turn. I have no sense of direction, and I couldn't remember which series of numbers would lead me to my dad's house. I realized I was lost when I passed a house on my left that was totally unfamiliar to me. Just in case it was simply a day vs. night problem, I kept going, until I hit a crossroads I know was not what I was looking for; the correct crossroads had a jog in it, and this one was straight across.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I pulled into the next driveway and turned around. In a few minutes, the unfamiliar house came up on my right. I looked toward it and was immediately scared out of my mind: there was some sort of little shadow creature walking across the front yard, leading by the hand a smaller, similar creature. They looked like creepy devil monkeys, with long, grasping arms and a waddling gait brought about by their short legs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before I could see details, I had passed the house. My heart had jumped into my throat and my adrenaline was going crazy. While my reptile brain entered fight-or-flight, the rest of me tried to figure out what I had just seen: was it a brief glimpse of a tacky lawn ornament? Some misshapen plant blowing in the wind? I was pretty sure it wasn't &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; a pair of devil monkey shadow creatures, but you never know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't have to wait long for an answer. A couple of minutes later I found the road I was looking for and turned left, only to be immediately confronted with another shadow creature moving very quickly across my right-side peripheral vision, about to enter the road in front of my car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My head snapped around to focus on the thing, and it disappeared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This happened at least twice more before I reached my dad's house: creepy damn thing in my peripheral vision that disappeared when I looked directly at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was so sleep-deprived that I was &lt;i&gt;hallucinating&lt;/i&gt;. Needless to say, I'm going to do my best to avoid that level of deprivation in the future, if only to give my reptile brain a rest. Even when you &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; they're not really there, they're still creepy as hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chapter 3: Conspiracies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second leg of the trip saw myself and my brother in the back of my dad's car as he drove the five hours from his house to my grandmother's house in Ohio. I could drive myself, but why? His car was free, and it freed me up from driving for five fucking hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we neared our destination, my podcast-listening was interrupted by my brother tapping my shoulder. He had been carrying on some conversation with my dad, and I was now being pulled in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Dude, do you think it's bad to be addicted to gay porn?" he asked after I had removed my headphones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"What?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"That doesn't make you a bad person, does it?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Huh?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out they had been discussing the father of a friend of his, who is apparently gay and addicted to gay porn. He's apparently a well-loved guy who teaches at Indiana Wesleyan University, the local Christian college, and he's so great that even though they apparently know he's gay, they haven't fired him yet. Which is actually part of their rules. You can get fired from there for watching and R-rated movie, for Christ's sake (no hyperbole; that's the truth).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Why would watching porn make him a bad person?" I asked, after I had the whole story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"That's what I'm saying," my brother replied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Lots of people watch porn and lots are addicted. If you're gay, what's wrong with watching gay porn as long as it doesn't interfere with the rest of your life?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"That's what I'm &lt;i&gt;saying&lt;/i&gt;, dad."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well," my dad said, stalling. "I'm not saying he's a &lt;i&gt;bad person&lt;/i&gt;. I'm just saying, you have to watch out, is all."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Watch out for what?" I said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well...You know...People like that?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"People like &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt;, dad?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"People...Well...I just heard it was little boys! You have to watch out for those people!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big alarm on my bullshit detector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Gay child porn? Dad, if he was watching that, and people knew about it, he'd be in jail."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"But the university protected him!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brief background: IWU, in Marion, Indiana, is notorious for raising major stinks every time something doesn't go as Christianly as they would like in town. When the movie "Little Nicky" was released, they bitched and moaned until the local theatre took down the poster. They didn't stop playing the movie, or advertising it on the marquee; they just took down the poster because a bunch of tight-ass fundamentalist evangelicals whined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They once lobbied to have the road behind the university closed to traffic because It's dangerous for students to cross it! They might get hit by a car! The road behind their campus is a residential street, on which people live. People who need to occasionally leave their houses in cars. I'm pretty sure that one was unsuccessful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest moral oppression on which they have thus far embarked involved a closed RCA/Thompson electronics plant on their side of town. Anheiser-Busch was looking to buy it up and move in. The fundies got up in arms. "We can't have a filthy alcohol company like that making beer in our town!" etc and so forth. They were so worried about the town's moral center that they raised a huge fuss over Budweiser even &lt;i&gt;looking&lt;/i&gt; at the plant. Word is that they were so loud and annoying that Anheiser-Busch pulled out. Of course, I've heard that was an unsubstantiated rumor told to demonize the university. But I heard that from a member of the university's church congregation. Everyone not associated with the college said they forced AB out of town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst part: there was to be no beer whatsoever in the factory. It was going to be used as a &lt;i&gt;labeling&lt;/i&gt; facility. Empty bottles would have &lt;i&gt;labels&lt;/i&gt; stuck on them. Evil! For that, hundreds of out-of-work laborers were denied a chance at a new job. Fantastic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite this, however, Indiana Wesleyan University would not and could not protect someone from federal prosecution for child pornography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Kiddie porn is a federal crime, dad!" I protested. "It's under the jurisdiction o the FBI! They can't protect him from that!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He snorted. "Jurisdiction!" He laughed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yes, dad, federal jurisdiction. Your conspiracy theorizing doesn't hold water."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He looked confused, then laughed again. "They protected him! He still works there, doesn't he?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"So?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He's gay! So they won't fire him because they're protecting him!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Dad...They do not have the power to protect him from a federal child pornography investigation."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My brother chimed in with a "Yeah!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My dad looked arrogant and changed the subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the hell is wrong with parents?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epilogue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah. This weekend I ran into an inordinate amount of meatspace situations where I had to bring my skeptical genius to bear. By far the coolest were the devil monkey hallucinations. I shit you not; there was a creepy shadow monkey-thing walking across that house's front lawn. Scared the shit out of me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the highlights of my weekend was hijacking the remote at my grandmother's house to turn on Mythbusters and hearing all of my younger cousins say "I love this show!" Maybe there's hope for the world after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not much in the way of insight or profundity or anything in today's post, I just thought it might be fun to show some patented Action Skepticism in, well, action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-432209269087306517?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230096788883"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/75749d1dd6ac77b0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Cash Cropped</title><published>2010-12-15T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2010-12-15T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/humor/check.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Mix-up with Christmas cards results in embarrassing faux pas.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230094583001"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=626">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6d06f3111b47b352</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Conclusive Proof That People Are Stupid"/><title type="html">What’s Another $14 Billion Anyway?</title><published>2008-12-24T04:51:20Z</published><updated>2008-12-24T04:51:20Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=626" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban echoed a lot of popular sentiment about the car industry &lt;a href="http://blogmaverick.com/2008/12/22/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that I feel is just poorly reasoned. Every time the beleaguered industry does just about anything anymore, they’re pilloried for it, and it just doesn’t make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First there was flying the corporate jet to Washington, where the Congressmen questioning them asked ridiculous things like “who here is willing to sell their jet now and drive back?” as if you can just put a Gulfstream V on Craigslist and it’s gone later that day. Then they advertised in the Wall Street Journal thanking Americans for the bailout (to which I was opposed, by the way) and they’re criticized for spending on that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because a company is having a hard time does not mean it should stop making efficient investments. In fact, it maybe should make more of them. A corporate jet is not just a luxury to a large corporation whose executives are required to travel frequently. It’s an investment. The cost of an hour of a corporate executive’s time sometimes makes them well-worth it. I’m not sure if that’s the case for Chrysler specifically, and that would have been an intelligent question to ask before suggesting they eBay their entire fleet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same with advertising. Advertising isn’t a luxury for a car company, it’s a necessity. When done properly, every dollar in ads amounts to more than a dollar in profits. As an investor in Chrysler, which George W. Bush has essentially made us all with the bailout, the last thing I want them to cut is their ad budget. I’d maybe want them to examine it for cost efficiencies, but cutting it out entirely would be certain death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, an ad calling us their investors is, I think, brilliant. People have been shown to greatly prefer patronizing businesses they own stock in over ones they don’t. If Chrysler can make Americans feel a sense of ownership, it might have some small effect on people when it comes time to buy a new SUV. I don’t know if that approach will work for them or not, but it’s certainly a valid angle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse yet there’s this silly notion that American car companies are losing because they simply aren’t innovative enough. Bullshit. They’re losing because every car costs $2,000 more to build due to higher wages and health care. That’s it. End of story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t out-innovate $2,000 per unit. It’s not possible. It’s just too much money for an industry that’s become largely commoditized. It’s like trying to compete with Bud Light but being forced to sell at Sam Adams prices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When every mid-sized sedan is more or less interchangeable, $2,000 is just a tremendous difference, and as a result every American car for twenty years, in order to compete, has had to either cost that much more, or cut back on that much worth of features. They’ve largely chosen the latter, because the former would have destroyed their volume, and as such they’ve gotten a reputation for shoddy quality. They’ve closed the gap a lot in the last 5 years, which is a testament to just how hard they’re trying, and in fact they might be out-innovating slightly, but they just can’t win a battle that’s perpetually uphill.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not as if Americans can’t engineer good cars. Our engineers are just as intelligent and driven as theirs. Our aviation and defense industries prove that. It’s just that their cost basis means they’d have to out-engineer the Japanese by an impossible margin to compete.  And the car industry is so massive and has so many companies vying for supremacy that there just isn’t $2,000 worth of slack laying around to pick up. Cost-cutting has, since Henry T. Ford, been the primary focus of the industry, and they’re pretty good at it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuban says they should focus less on reducing costs and instead “figure out what cars consumers want, and how much they need to sell for.” To illustrate just how stupid that idea is, here are the top 10 selling cars in America (&lt;a href="http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2008/06/04/088884.html"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;):
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Ford F-Series
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Toyota Camry
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Chevy Silverado
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Honda Accord
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Honda Civic
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Toyota Corolla
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Nissan Altima
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Chevy Impala
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Dodge Ram
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Ford focus
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks to me like they’ve figured out what cars Americans want. They’ve got 5 of the top 10 models, including numbers 1 and 3. What more do you want from them? Actually, what you want is for them to make a profit on those proportional to what their competitors do.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Americans don’t just say “I want a mid-sized sedan and I want to pay $25,000 for it.” They decide what type of car they want and then shop around. They want to get what they want and pay the least for it they can.  American manufacturers have determined the price they need to sell for, and they’ve been selling at that price. The problem is that price is above the cost for Toyota to manufacture it but below that cost for GM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also here’s an interesting line about total profits from a slightly outdated &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/gmvstoyota/"&gt;NPR comparison&lt;/a&gt; between GM and Toyota:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;$4.15 billion loss from North America operations off-set by profits in Europe and Asia for an overall loss of $3.8 billion
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that in other parts of the world, where their per-unit costs are on par with the Japanese, they actually make money.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why the executives are focused on lowering employee wages and benefits. You can’t out innovate $2,000 in a commodity business. And even if you could, doing so should net you $2,000 in extra profit over your competitors, not parity. Forcing them to continually fight uphill will inevitably lead to failure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is why I’ve never purchased an American car, and why I was against the bailout. They’ve been unable to convince me to buy one because their cars weren’t as good as Toyota’s. It may not be the fault of their engineers, but I’m still not driving a vastly inferior car just so unskilled laborers in Detroit can make $50 an hour flipping switches and pushing buttons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’ve been unable to convince me that the bailout is a good idea unless there were strict guidelines ensuring that changed. They seem to have been unable to convince the Senate of that too, but thanks to Bush being as fiscally liberal as he is socially conservative, they didn’t have to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

Soon after his return from the voyage on &lt;em&gt;HMS Beagle&lt;/em&gt; he was struck down by a mysterious illness. Much energy has been expended on deciding what it might have been—a supposed conflict between Christian belief and rationalism, a parasite picked up in Brazil, or even, some say, the obsessive swallowing of air. The great man’s later years were marked by a series of bizarre attempts to remedy his feeble state (even if he did write that illness, “though it has annihilated several years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society and its amusements”).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S5&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darwinism’s fantastic voyage&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Helena Cronin,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Oliver Curry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961874-7/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618747.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the 1966 film &lt;em&gt;Fantastic Voyage&lt;/em&gt;, miniaturised doctors are injected into a scientist’s body, on a last-ditch mission to save his life and the vital scientific breakthrough that would perish with him. From their diminutive submarine, the human body—so familiar to the elite team—becomes a revelation. The commonplace becomes the unknown, the strange, a source of wonder. As one crew member remarks: “We’re going to see things no one has ever seen before.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S11&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Richard Harries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961875-9/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618759.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can easily understand why Darwin’s &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&lt;/em&gt; has been so influential: it consists of a sustained, strongly argued case with enough vivid examples to convince educated readers without overwhelming them with too much technical detail. Ever since his voyage on &lt;em&gt;HMS Beagle&lt;/em&gt; in 1831, Darwin had been reflecting on the issues and accumulating data, and the idea of natural selection as the great clue to nature had long been in his mind. But &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; was not published until 1859.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S14&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Art and evolution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tom Lubbock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961876-0/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618760.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin found little use for art. In his introduction to &lt;em&gt;The Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals&lt;/em&gt;, he recorded his disappointment. “I had hoped to derive much aid from the great masters in painting and sculpture, who are such close observers. Accordingly I have looked at photographs and engravings of many well-known works; but, with a few exceptions, have not thus profited.” And it may seem that artists have returned the compliment, finding little use for Darwin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S21&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Evolution: medicine’s most basic science&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Randolph M Nesse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961877-2/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618772.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The celebrations for the bicentennial of Darwin’s birth will be grand for good reason. Darwin’s discoveries are generating new insights faster than ever, especially in medicine and public health. Second editions of important books on evolution and medicine have just appeared, major conferences are taking place worldwide, and scores of universities now offer courses on evolutionary medicine. However, physicians are being left out. Most never take an evolutionary biology course, and no medical school teaches evolutionary biology as a basic medical science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S28&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;The evolution of fruit-fly biology&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ralph J Greenspan,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Martin Kreitman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961878-4/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618784.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout its research history, the fruit fly &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; has provided insights into the nature and role of mutation and genetic variation in evolution. More recently, it has also contributed to our understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms. Altogether, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the fruit fly has been the darwinians’ workhorse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S34&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Socioeconomic inequalities in ageing and health&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robert L Perlman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961879-6/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618796.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic inequalities in health are complex and challenging problems. Although the poorer health and shorter life expectancies of people in lower socioeconomic groups than of those in more privileged classes are not surprising, elucidation of the reasons for these inequalities has proven difficult. Some researchers have focused on the role of unhealthy behaviours, others have emphasised the importance of psychosocial stress, and yet others have called attention to material problems such as diet, housing, and occupational exposure to toxins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S40&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Forebears and heirs: a sketch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;David Sharp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961880-2/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618802.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a collection of Darwin material lies a privately printed document from 1888 on Charles Darwin’s ancestors, a painstaking inquiry drawing heavily on records of legal documents such as wills and property transfers. Confidence in information on the Darwin forebears arrives in the 17th century with a succession of William Darwins, one of whom married the daughter of a lawyer called Erasmus Earle, whose forename was to have several entries in the Darwin dynasty. The wife of this William’s son was heiress to Robert Waring, two other dynastic names.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S45&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Synthetic biology&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Henry Nicholls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961881-4/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618814.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s intelligent design, but not as we know it.

That’s the way it is. Charles Darwin left Cambridge University, set sail on &lt;em&gt;HMS Beagle&lt;/em&gt;, headed straight for the Galapagos archipelago in the Pacific, and while pondering the improbable life residing there he saw the little brown and black birds with their differently shaped bills and “Eureka!”—the theory of evolution hatched right there. Darwin winged it home, wrote &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;, and the rest is history. Had it not been for those 14 species of unprepossessing birds, humankind would still be languishing in some intellectual dark age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S57&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bold flights of a speculative mind&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Andrew Bell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961883-8/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618838.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Until Mr. Darwin can overcome the strong evidence that undoubtedly exists adverse to his views, he cannot hope to carry conviction to the minds of those even disposed to accept the bold flights of a speculative mind. To those, on the other hand, who would require testimony of the strongest possible kind to substantiate views so utterly opposed to their conception of man’s mental and moral attributes, and the responsibilities which the possession of them necessarily entails, Mr. Darwin’s array of facts must appear quite inadequate, and his reasoning from them inconclusive, if not altogether false.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S68&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darwin and the philosophers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Athar Yawar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961884-X/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067360861884X.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin is widely venerated as the man who discovered evolution. But did he? When Darwin wrote, the theory that complex life developed from simple life, by material transformation, was already old: it had been advocated by, among others, his paternal grandfather Erasmus. Did Darwin, then, discover the mechanism of natural selection? No. His achievement was to propose that life—including human life—developed, and could be explained, solely by mechanistic forces, primarily natural and sexual selection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S74&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darwin’s writing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Richard Horton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961885-1/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618851.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike most of today’s scientists, Charles Darwin’s fame is based on books. In a series of extraordinary volumes—&lt;em&gt;The Voyage of the Beagle&lt;/em&gt; (1839), &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt; (1859), &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/em&gt; (1871), and &lt;em&gt;The Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals&lt;/em&gt; (1872)—Darwin reported his observations, explained his ideas, and amplified his thinking in ways well beyond the contemporary expectations of science. His books were neither summaries nor simplifications: they were the core of his originality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S85&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Race, genetics, and medicine at a crossroads&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Hardy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961886-3/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618863.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past 5 years, the technologies available to geneticists have advanced in leaps and bounds. It is now possible to analyse more than 500 000 polymorphisms in an individual on a DNA chip at reasonably low cost. These polymorphisms have been judiciously chosen, on the basis of human haplotype structure, to allow high-resolution surveys aimed at identifying any common genetic variability that predisposes to disease. Although the major driving force for the design of these genetic platforms has been the identification of disease risk loci, a task for which they have been extremely successful, their use is also having profound effects on other areas of biology and especially on population genetics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S90&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Epigenetics in evolution and disease&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Manel Esteller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961887-5/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618875.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are not our genes.

In Lehninger’s classic textbook for students of medicine and biology we can find a more accurate definition: we are our proteins (and our carbohydrates, fat, and so on). This more precise definition relates to the central dogma of molecular biology, that our proteins are generated from our DNA via an RNA intermediate state. These RNA molecules are translated into proteins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S97&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antibiotic resistance: adaptive evolution&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;George PC Salmond,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Martin Welch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961888-7/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618887.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width:1px"&gt;  &lt;a title="Close" href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelancet.com/images/clear.gif" alt="Close" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Close&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring.”&lt;em&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;S104&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span&gt;21st century eugenics?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nancy E Hansen,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Heidi L Janz,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Dick J Sobsey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div style="display:block;float:left"&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:void(0);"&gt;Preview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2808%2961889-9/fulltext"&gt;Full Text&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140673608618899.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/vKETD_3Qnck" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230086703366"><id gr:original-id="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/?p=339">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/505c9c9ef1da4a03</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><category term="Absolutely Psychic"/><category term="psychics"/><title type="html">A Letter to a Psychic</title><published>2008-12-24T02:43:17Z</published><updated>2008-12-24T02:43:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/2008/12/23/a-letter-to-a-psychic/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepbitch.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Psychic, or just adviser?" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/psychicsign.jpg?w=88&amp;amp;h=96" alt="psychicsign" width="88" height="96"&gt;A few days ago I received an email from “Belle”, who claims to be a psychic. This email was in regards to my &lt;a href="http://www.bad-language.com/psychicskeptic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Psychic Skeptic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this particular investigation I infiltrated &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.absolutelypsychic.com/"&gt;Absolutely Psychic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a psychic telephone service, and after passing their application process&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I was offered a job as a psychic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These blow jobs have harassed and threatened me for publishing the article and mentioning their name, but I have the smoking gun: the contract they offered to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past seven years, Belle has worked as a ‘psychic’ phone operator for &lt;strong&gt;Absolutely (Not) Psychic&lt;/strong&gt; (tee hee!). She contacted me, ostensibly in support of my call to expose &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bad-language.com/unscrupulous"&gt;Unscrupulous Psychics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but subtly, in defence of &lt;strong&gt;Absolutely (Not) Psychic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was composing a response to Belle I thought, why not post it to my blog? Her email was intended for public consumption anyway. So, without futher ado, here is Belle’s email (unabridged), and my reply…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi Karen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I commend you for this website. Indeed there are many psychic networks that are questionable.   I know because I have worked for PRN, Psychic Friends Network and other networks as well such as Psychic chat  and psychic source. Psychic chat   owns a sex club and psychic source has another hot line that markets sexual hookups.    But I think you should cut some slack to Absolutely Psychic because they are no where near the sleeze bags in the market.  APN is 1 thing and 1 thing only:  TESTED PSYCHICS.   Now, in my humble and respectful opinion, being offered a contract is much different than being able to maintain it.  Calls are monitored and client feedback factors into maintaining the position.  This is the equivalent of marriage.   Walking down the aisle doesn’t guarantee you a successful marriage.  But a person of your great merits knows that and I don’t need to elaborate in any further because you weren’t contracted by them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Freedom of speech is a great liberty but the written word doesn’t always portray the entire or accurate story.  For this reason, I will extend my liberty in free speech as I have worked for Absolutely Psychic Network (APN) for 7 years and have found it to be EXCELLENT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for the 2nd person who alleges to have worked for them, I can only say that if she  researched the market she would notice that Absolutely Psychic Network/Absolutelypsychic.com (APN)  offers the highest pay scale.  They have given me a raise every year and gift card for such long years of service.   Independent contractor work liberates one to pursue other career paths simultaneously.   If she doesn’t have other venues of expression, then sure frustration is possible.  But I believe that the universe may be trying to say something to that person.  I’m 51 years old and have been around the block longer for quite some time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Namaste&lt;br&gt;
Belle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Dear Belle,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Thank you for your email.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Owning a phone sex hotline in conjunction with a psychic hotline isn’t what makes a psychic hotline questionable. It’s that the psychic hotline company and operators think they’re “psychic” that’s questionable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;The bottom line is, I was offered a contract by Absolutely Psychic, but I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; psychic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As you say, Absolutely Psychic contract “TESTED PSYCHICS” only, and by passing their tests and being offered a contract, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; one of those.  By their own admission, I am one of those ‘true psychics’, the “1%” to whom they offer contracts. But I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a psychic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As easily as I passed the company’s tests, without being psychic, I could have maintained the ‘marriage’ of the contract.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;It’s exactly what you do, but you call the psychology, the advice, the comfort, the guesswork, the friendliness, the speculation, the amateur counseling, the unqualified therapy, and ‘being around the block’ by another word… “psychic”.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;If we consider the paranormal definition of &lt;em&gt;psychic&lt;/em&gt;, no “psychic” has ever demonstrated that they are psychic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;In your email, you’ve judged the worth of the company by its treatment of its staff, the pay, and the perks, rather than the validity of the very trade; or in this case, the invalidity of the trade.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;With respect,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Karen.&lt;/div&gt;

The image they posted is gorgeous, but copyrighted, so go there to see the nice high-res version. But to give you a low-res idea, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Collinder_399.jpg"&gt;here’s a shot that’s on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Collinder_399.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/coathangercluster.jpg" alt="Coat Hanger cluster, aka Brocchi’s cluster, aka Collinder 399"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your hangup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this object, because - let’s face it — it’s a coat hanger! It also holds a special place for me because I spotted it by accident when I was but a lad and using my telescope to sweep the summer skies. I remember looking through the finder ’scope, which had a wide-ish field of view, and suddenly a clump of brighter stars moved past my sight. I maneuvered the lumbering ’scope back a little bit, and there it was. I laughed and laughed; it was a perfect coat hanger in the sky! The stars making it up are a bit brighter than the background stars, and the asterism (a collection of unrelated stars making a pattern) was so obvious and so perfect I couldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was before the internet, so I wasn’t able to go online and look it up. I sometimes wonder what it’s like to be an amateur astronomer just starting out now, being able to sit and within seconds find information on almost anything you’re likely to see floating among the constellations. And now, of course, even small telescopes are computerized, so you can type in a name and whizzzzzz! The ’scope will slew right over to the object. That’s very cool, and quite a time saver (no small consideration when it’s cold). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also means that someone today might miss out on the Coat Hanger, and that would be too bad. There are dozens, hundreds, of such things in the sky, and I can’t possibly write about all of them. But if you own a small telescope, I think the very best thing you can do is dress warmly, go outside, and just &lt;em&gt;have fun&lt;/em&gt;. You have a magnificent tool in your hands that people centuries ago would have cheerfully gone to war over, and all you have to do is &lt;em&gt;go outside&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go outside. Look up.

Yes, the &lt;i&gt;"blogaversary"&lt;/i&gt;.  I totally missed it as I was probably shoveling, reading, taking care of the kid, or otherwise engaged in menial housework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally, I had planned for this site to be a place to gather writing for a book (don't we all?).  Once I realized how scatterbrained I actually am, that thought changed to something a little more realistic: the blog would remain just a place to write about things that piss me off and, occasionally, inspire me.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still plan on writing a book (don't we all...) but I am having a lot of fun with this place and the freedom it allows me for expression of funny, original, and hopefully (at least every now and then) somewhat intelligent thoughts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks again to everyone who drops into check out what shows up here.  I'd be writing anyway, but it means a lot when you get those site hits and the occasional comment.  More posting coming soon!&lt;div&gt;Skeptical Rants and Comments on Society &amp;amp; News

I can say it here. I can say it to other atheists. But can I stand up for myself to a believer? Not quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure PS knows I’m an atheist, but I can’t seem to admit it in conversation yet. Instead, I say, “an atheist would think…’ or “They tend to say…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were having a discussion about religion and spirituality. We both agreed that religion and spirituality are different things. PS claims that atheists are denying part of reality. She says that we as humans have a connection to a higher power, to something greater than ourselves, and denying God or Goddess is denying a major part of life. I believe that connection is an illusion. Just because you feel a connection doesn’t mean its there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to agree that an individual human is more valuable (for undefined values) than an individual tree, but that if we cut down all the trees it would be bad. However, PS seems to believe that there is some mystical force or energy that determines what is alive and what is not, and that being alive connects all living things and that she can feel it. I believe that she may very well feel that, but that we are only connected to other living things in the ways that we actually interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that anybody can convince themselves that they feel a connection, or no connection. Senses are fallible. Optical illusions, extremes of temperature feeling opposite, feeling bugs crawling at a suggestion. I once “heard” a piano cadenza when a doctor walked into my hospital room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For good or ill, we didn’t get much further than stating our positions. I think we were both polite as well, since we value each others friendship despite disagreeing on the spiritual aspect of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed I used the words “I believe” several times. There seems to be a lack of evidence as to the connection I’ve been talking about, but it is an untestable question. If you can feel a connection, but not do anything with it or feel changes in it, its rather hard to test. I prefer to dismiss non-falsifiable feelings as tricks of the mind. PS prefers to accept this one as real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My introspection on these questions leads me to consider the nature of reality. I believe the world I see and feel is reality and not a giant dream. I believe that I am human, self-aware and able to communicate with other humans. I believe that there is a body of scientific literature that has tested many hypotheses and theories over the years. I believe that the people I see around me have their own thoughts and feelings and that I don’t make them up. I choose to accept as real those things which I could theoretically observe, given time and equipment, in the world that perceive with my senses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vera</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230068547109"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/23/orbital-spacex-win-nasa-contract/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/19d952f3182bfda6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><category term="Space"/><title type="html">Orbital, SpaceX win NASA contract</title><published>2008-12-23T21:42:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-23T21:42:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/23/orbital-spacex-win-nasa-contract/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speaking of SpaceX, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/dec/HQ_C08-069_ISS_Resupply.html"&gt;NASA just announced two HUGE awards&lt;/a&gt; for private contractors: $1.9 billion to Orbital Sciences, and $1.6 billion to SpaceX!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. These contracts are for lifting supplies to the International Space Station, and are for at least 20 tons of uploaded mass each (Orbital is required to have 8 launches, and SpaceX 12). SpaceX can do that pretty easily with their new Falcon 9 (assuming all goes well with their maiden voyage of the new rocket sometime in 2009), which can lift 12 tons per launch. According to NASA, these two companies can provide all the ISS needs for supplies during the era between the Shuttle and Constellation, roughly 2010 through 2015. The contracts are good through 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll note that here is where government directly affects the private sector. That’s a lot of cash going to people who will use it to grow their industry, hire more highly-trained people, and maybe, just maybe, open up space to all of us in the coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool, and my congratulations to both companies!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230065857915"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4908">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0af2d8ad185bd6ce</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="afternoon inquisition"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 12.23</title><published>2008-12-23T20:00:13Z</published><updated>2008-12-23T20:00:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4908" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1bf777bb9635655676b4221d9cca69d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the newest episode of the Skepchick Podcast (the last for 2008) out today, my question is related and simple:&lt;/p&gt;

After all, the claims of "healers" using such modalities, when boiled down to their very essence, are nothing less (and nothing more) than claiming the ability to do magic. Indeed, "energy healing" involves the claim of being able to manipulate "life energies" undetectable by science for therapeutic intent using either ritualistic hand motions or the inscribing of symbols in the air (&lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;), concentration and the laying on of hands (therapeutic touch, &lt;em&gt;reiki&lt;/em&gt;, and others), or sticking tiny needles into "points" that are supposed to lie along "meridians" through which this energy "flows" (acupuncture, acupressure, and related therapies). Faith healing also involves the laying on of hands, but it also involves invoking a god or gods to heal the sick through mystical means. This is very different from having a chaplain come in and pray, because responsible religious leaders do not claim that they can use the power of God to heal, although admittedly the line can become blurry. In any case, chaplains can often bring comfort to the ill as counselors aside from their religious role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the mystical, magical, nonscientific nature of these "healing" modalities, you would think that the state should have nothing to do with them other than preventing them from preying on the gullible. In Russia, at least, &lt;a href="http://www.ajc.com/shared-gen/content/shared-gen/ap/Europe/EU_Russia_Licensing_Faith_Healers.html"&gt;you'd be wrong&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

No, there's a substantial amount of left-over sludge called coal ash, a nasty mess that is enriched for toxic heavy metals. It is &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste"&gt;seriously nasty stuff&lt;/a&gt;. This glop has to be stored, somewhere, usually piled up and walled-off, because it's not healthy for &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behold what happens when the containment walls fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is happening right now, here in the United States. Yesterday, a retaining wall failed, and 500 million gallons of coal ash — the vile grey slime in the video — poured down into the tributaries of the Tennessee River, the water supply for Chattannooga and environs.&lt;/p&gt;

I see this every single time some school board gets the zombie-bite of young-Earth creationists packing their membership, or the Disco ‘tute gets some bug in their britches about reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here’s my message to the world: welcome to our nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/76915/Third-of-teachers-want-Creationism"&gt;A survey in the UK&lt;/a&gt; shows that about 1/3 of the teachers in England and Wales think creationism should be taught in science. About half think it shouldn’t be (one assumes the rest have no opinion),  while 2/3 of the teachers think it should at least be discussed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;70% of &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; teachers think creationism should not be taught, which sounds good until you realize that means 30% of science teachers think it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be. About 3/4 of science teachers think it should be discussed in the classroom (one assumes the survey distinguishes between discussing it and teaching it). In my opinion that’s a mistake, as most science teachers are probably not prepared to deal with the issue very well. It’s not simple to go over the many failings of creationism versus science, and it’s made far more treacherous in the classroom because you’re dealing with the beliefs of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about 1/4 of teachers overall understand young-Earth creationism for what it is: &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A funny thing. The newspaper article linked above has this headline: &amp;quot;THIRD OF TEACHERS WANT CREATIONISM&amp;quot;. The headline for the actual survey (done by the &lt;a href="http://www.ipsos-mori.com/content/home-page-news/teachers-dismiss-calls-for-creationism-to-be-taugh.ashx%20target="&gt;Ipsos Mori&lt;/a&gt; research organization, was: &amp;quot;Teachers Dismiss Calls For Creationism To Be Taught In School Science Lessons&amp;quot;, which is more accurate, but still downplays the fact that way too many teachers think creationism should be taught. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess with creationism, the water glass is half empty if you’re a newspaper editor, and half full if you’re a researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither attitude changes the cold, hard fact, that the hydrogen in that water is 13.7 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)  The UK newspaper The Guardian &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2008/dec/22/atlas-creationism-adnan-oktar-harun-yahya"&gt;has a big article in it&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/artsNews/idUSL0992091620080509?sp=true"&gt;convicted criminal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; Turkish Muslim creationist Adnan Oktar, aka Harun Yahya. This is a wealthy man who wrote a book called &lt;em&gt;The Atlas of Creation&lt;/em&gt;, filled with plagiarized pictures and chock full o’ lies and nonsense about evolution and fossils. I invite you &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;to go through PZ’s site&lt;/a&gt; for a dissection of this guy’s overarching pogrom against reality. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/creationist_amorality.php"&gt;Here’s a fun one by PZ&lt;/a&gt; to give you a taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guardian article takes Oktar to task pretty well, essentially pointing out how creepy and slick he and his organization are. However, the author made one error I think is important. She points out that his creationist tome is huge and expensive, and that it &amp;quot;has thudded onto 10,000 doormats since its publication in 2006.&amp;quot; However, she never actually explicitly states that &lt;em&gt;these copies were not sold.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harun_Yahya#The_Atlas_of_Creation"&gt;Oktar sent them unsolicited all over the place&lt;/a&gt;, to schools, Universities, and what-have-you. This is important because the way she wrote the article implies that it has sold a lot of copies. It hasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as PZ points out in the links above, it’s hugely packed with lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not happy about creationism infecting Europe at all. In many cases over there, it’s not the literal Bible kind we have here, it’s the literal Koran kind. Both are wrong. To believe the Earth and Universe are only thousands of years old is to deny many thousands of separate pieces of evidence. Oktar himself has a prize he claims he will give to anyone who can show him a single fossil that proves evolution. Of course, it takes a series of fossils to show evolution is true, but that misses the bigger point: &lt;em&gt;they &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; show evolution to be true.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His prize is for &lt;em&gt;trillions of dollars&lt;/em&gt;, by the way, so one can assume that even that claim Oktar makes is full of it. I guess when you lie so often and so easily, telling the truth about anything becomes nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr width="30%" align="left"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can be done about all this? &lt;strong&gt;Fight&lt;/strong&gt;. Make your voice heard. Keep talking about it. Keep pointing out where young-Earth creationists are wrong, and where their most famous mouthpieces are lying (and maybe drop in a hint about the Ninth Commandment). Point them to &lt;a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-meritt.html"&gt;the Creationism FAQ at talk.origins&lt;/a&gt;. And wherever you are, do what you can to defend reality. In America, it means voting. The same is probably true in the UK, though in Turkey that option may be limited. When your country is ruled by religious zealotry options do tend to be restricted. That’s one reason I remain vocal in my own United States about religious control of politicians, no matter what that religion may be. For a society to remain free, it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; remain secular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth, it turns out, really &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; set you free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230060204652"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-6284200841781212460">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/07d5c44c14af3585</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">An Academic Responds to the Homeopathy Challenge</title><published>2008-12-23T17:56:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-23T17:56:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/12/academic-responds-to-homeopathy.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Le Canard Noir</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230060204651"><id gr:original-id="446 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/205e68be9f85acd6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">(Alternative) Medical Advances Continue in North Korea</title><published>2008-12-23T17:53:22Z</published><updated>2008-12-23T17:53:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/446" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.layscience.net/files/bpsdb.jpg"&gt;[&lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;] As we come towards the end of 2008, North Korea's &lt;a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/"&gt;inimitable national news outlet&lt;/a&gt; / propaganda machine brings us news of two amazing new medical breakthroughs that will surely keep the not-at-all brutally oppressed people - the ones that aren't being &lt;a href="http://freekorea.us/2007/02/18/holocaust-now-looking-down-into-hell-at-camp-22/"&gt;slaughtered in concentration camps&lt;/a&gt; while the world turns a blind eye - in good health and spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did he establish the untimely passing away of an IDEA? By checking on the status of the 30+ IDEA chapters at various universities, colleges and high schools. While absence of activity is no evidence of its passing away, I encourage PT readers to do the research to determine the status of these IDEA chapters using independent methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen MacNeill concludes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) that the national IDEA Club website is essentially what is known online as a “shell site” (that is, a place-holder with no real content);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) that the “movement” represented by the IDEA Club organization peaked in late 2005 or early 2006 (around the time of the Kitzmiller v. Dover trial);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) since then (i.e. since Judge Jones issued his now-famous decision) it has died almost everywhere;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) the majority of the output of the “intelligent design movement” consisted of press releases (and produced no empirical science of any kind); 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For his conclusion read further at &lt;a href="http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2008/12/intelligent-design-movement-on-college.html" rel="external "&gt;The Evolution List&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course our friend Casey Luskin had to respond, blaming the death on IDEA’s success. What is clear that the IDEA ‘centers’ are following in the footsteps of its ‘Big Daddy’ and are refraining from scientific content or relevancy. Casey Luskin’s explanation of this lack of scientific content?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, students who start IDEA Clubs in the post-Dover era face new challenges that students didn’t used to face: Students I talk to feel the scientific evidence for ID is stronger than ever, but they see the persecution of ID proponents in the academy (persecution which has dramatically increased in the wake of Dover). Many pro-ID students are afraid; they are intimidated by Darwinist intolerance and fear that if they come out of the closet about being pro-ID, they might be ending their careers before they even begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure Casey, that must be the case, that mythical persecution complex quickly arises to ‘explain’ the lack of scientific content.
Surely ID must have found a more novel explanation by now for its continued inability to deliver scientific content?
Seems to me that the Discovery Institute’s insistence that Judge Jones rules on whether or not ID is science, continues to misfire…

Then the blogger became the raving anti-abortionist, and most of his readership left — they even set up an independent forum where they could continue their discussions without the weirdo in charge of the blog butting in (uh-oh…I just gave you all an idea, didn&amp;#39;t I?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now the process of conversion is complete. &lt;a href="http://ravingatheist.com/2008/12/christ-is-the-lord/"&gt;Say goodbye to the Raving Atheist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's an interesting analysis of the process of deconversion to be made here. I suspect he's been getting a lot of personal support and attention from Christians actively interested in converting him over the years, and it's that emotional massaging that convinced him to throw his brain out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

The episode, which aired on December 11, featured a segment on autism featuring an old "friend" of the blog. The fact that he was featured on a television show ostensibly designed to discuss medicine and make it accessible to a general audience tells me that not only the producers but the physicians who do the show are utterly without a clue.

You’re panicked, and you’re not sure what to do. Run to the bookstore for a gift certificate? Hope the local superbox has more cartons of electric toothbrushes? Just panic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some things you still can do. They may not be the latest video game or a big plasma TV, but there are some things you can do to get gifts, and maybe do a good deed at the same time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;Donate to JREF&lt;/strong&gt;: The James Randi Educational Foundation (full disclosure: I’m President of the JREF) is trying to make the world a better place by promoting critical thinking. The JREF provides local and national media a rational viewpoint if they need it (and boy, do they need it), and is currently in a phase of expansion that, frankly, costs money. &lt;a href="http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/support-us.html"&gt;Donating to the JREF&lt;/a&gt; will help it achieve its goal of a planet filled with skeptical people. You can become a member, too, for buy a membership for a friend or loved one. It’s tax-deductible, and the end of the year is coming…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;strong&gt;Buy my book&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;’nuff said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;strong&gt;Skepchick&lt;/strong&gt;: The Skepchicks &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4483"&gt;posted a skeptical holiday gift guide&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bit late to get things shipped, but they have some cool ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;strong&gt;Skeptical charities&lt;/strong&gt;: Both &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2007/12/atheist-charities.html"&gt;TechSkeptic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://friendlyatheist.com/6961/why-should-you-donate/"&gt;The Friendly Atheist&lt;/a&gt; have posted lists of non-religious charities, should you choose to remain secular but still be able to do good things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holidays are for everyone, even skeptics. Have fun, enjoy friends and family, and maybe you can even make the world a better place at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230053983159"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/machines_of_aggressively_lovin.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7219a42caa5482b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Machines of aggressively loving grace</title><published>2008-12-23T17:10:11Z</published><updated>2008-12-23T17:10:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/493316233/machines_of_aggressively_lovin.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/machines_of_aggressively_lovin.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blogging on Peer-Reviewed Research" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/rb.png" width="120" height="90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squid don't just make sperm: they package it up into fairly elaborate little torpedoes called spermatophores, which are either handed to the female with a specially modified arm called the hectocotyl arm, or squirted onto her with a penis. Once on the female (or a male, it really doesn't matter), the spermatophore everts, forming a structure called the spermatangia, in which all the packed sperm uncoil, ready to do their job, and the whole mass is anchored to the target with a cement body. These structures do show species-specific differences, but here is one example from &lt;i&gt;Heteroteuthis dispar&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="spermatophore.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/23/spermatophore.jpeg" width="361" height="269"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heteroteuthis dispar&lt;/i&gt;. Spermatophore (a) and spermatangium (b) &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the curious observation: squid are often captured festooned with spermatophores and spermatangia, and in many cases, the spermatangia may be imbedded deeply into the musculature of the animal — so it&amp;#39;s not simply as if the spermatophores are lovingly placed in an appropriate orifice, they are &lt;i&gt;piercing&lt;/i&gt; the female (or the male, again, they don't care that much), tearing deep into the interior. The question is, how do they get in there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few simple observations have revealed the answer. Spermatophores can be triggered by a gentle squeeze, at which time all of their fertilization machinery will fire. Here are some photos of some spermatophores going to work on a squid carcass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="implant.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/23/implant.jpeg" width="400" height="652"&gt;(A) Placement of spermatophores on a dead male specimen of &lt;i&gt;Moroteuthis ingens&lt;/i&gt; (mantle length ~300 
mm) and initiation of the spermatophoric reaction by pressing on the ejaculatory apparatus with a forceps. (B) 
Same specimen, but submerged in seawater, showing the ejaculating spermatophores. (C) Exterior view of 
implanted spermatangia in tissue of a female, showing the site of penetration and part of the amber ejaculatory 
apparatus. (D) Interior view of same spermatangia, showing the sperm mass and the amber ejaculatory apparatus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Read the caption carefully. That's a &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; triggering sperm to &lt;i&gt;ejaculate&lt;/i&gt; into a &lt;i&gt;dead male squid&lt;/i&gt;. It's gay necrophiliac bestiality! You don't see that in the papers every day.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The answer is that spermatophores also release digestive enzymes and actively burrow into the target tissue. Squid sperm show an aggressive persistence and vigorously active assault on the female body that our own pathetic human emissions lack…I feel a little inadequate, but I&amp;#39;m sure women are a bit relieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting observation is the function of the squid penis. It seems to be less an intromittent organ than a kind of hose to direct the ejaculations onto the female. In natural situations, unlike the photographs above, it is responsible for initiating the spermatophore reaction. Each spermatophore has a threadlike extension of a surrounding membrane, and tugging on that triggers the reaction. It's like a squad of paratroopers leaping out of a phallic airplane, each attached by a static line that yanks the rip cord as they emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

One such individual is Stephen E. Robinson, a Mormon scholar and apologist and head of the department of Ancient Scripture at Brigham Young University. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robinson earned his PhD under James H. &lt;span&gt;Charlesworth&lt;/span&gt; at Duke University (now of Princeton), and worked with &lt;span&gt;Charlesworth&lt;/span&gt; on the Syriac text and translation of the Odes of Solomon. Thus, Professor Robinson was the scholar I thought could answer a textual question on the Book of Mormon (see below).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Back Ground Information:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty years (1981 - 2001) I attended the &lt;span&gt;Greenville&lt;/span&gt; First Ward &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Church as a non-member while I studied the social and religious organizational structure of the Mormons and what happened to newly proselytized converts as they were taught this new “religious truth” .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Towards the end of my two decades with the First Ward, I had a acquired a leather bound “Scripture” (a term &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; members collectively call the Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price and the Doctrine and Covenants) heavily highlighted and notarized. Plus, I have lost tract of the number of times I had met with Mormon Elders / Missionaries in discussions and in friendly debates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What most non-Mormons fail to understand when discussing theology with &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; members is that their doctrinal authority is built on an ascending level of authority. Here is the level they accept from the lest authoritative to the most:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Old Testament is on the bottom and is subject to the New Testament which is subject to the Book of Mormon which is subject to the Pearl of Great Price which is subject to the Doctrines and Covenants which is subject to the General Authorities of the Church who themselves are subject to the living Prophet / President of the Church. This is one reason why a Protestant or non-believer who tries to debate Mormon elders using the Bible only method will find themselves up against a wall. In other words, what we have here is a process of religious dogmatic evolution from the lowest doctrinal forms (the Old Testament) to the highest level; the living Prophet of the &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, I learned from a former professor of religion at Brigham Young University that Mormons are simply not interested in the historical Joseph Smith, but only the Joseph Smith as understood and presented by the writings of their Church. In other words, the LSD Church controls the image of a mythical Joseph Smith over a historical Joseph Smith to support their faith. This is one reason why &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Mormons are warned about reading historical books on the Prophet Joseph Smith or as one &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Apostle once stated about non-Mormons: “They lie in wait to deceive!” To counter this attack, Mormons are read only publications printed &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; approved publishers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, since Jesus Christ has now restored the true Church under Joseph Smith, all other churches are viewed as false and even considered under the direct leadership of Satan himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact is, since there are still five remaining Book of Mormon churches left (out of the 15 sects that were struggling for the right to be the true and original restored “Church” at the death of Joseph Smith), the &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Mormons (the name of the largest 15 million plus group Utah sect) tried unsuccessfully to get exclusive use of the term “Mormon” as a registered Trade Mark in the U.S. Patten office to keep its use away from other Book of Mormon sects . So, even if one believes that Joseph Smith is a true prophet who restored "The True Church", and one believes the Book of Mormon was translated from the Golden Plates, these individual Book of Mormon sects will attack and evangelized one another as fast as they will proselytize people who do not believe in the Book of Mormon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Mormon Church, all men and most women (usually between high school and college age) are expected to complete a two year mission in either a distant state or country of which fifty percent is financed by the family of the mission elder and the other half is paid for by the &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Church. For those youths who have never gone on a mission (especially the men), they are continually made to feel like a Protestant Christian who believes in Christ, but like a believer who had never been baptized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I had done two lectures and slide presentations on the early life and times of Joseph Smith (Translating and Revealing the Word of God: Joseph Smith and the Formation of the Mormon Church and a detailed lecture on the five belief systems of the remaining “Book of Mormon Churches”) I could spent a dozen posts and still not relate all the details even most &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Mormons themselves don’t know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mormons strongly believe that not only did Joseph Smith restored the "True Church of Jesus Christ", but since the Bible was not “translated correctly” it was corrupted by the false Christian churches. In this light, the Book of Mormon is the considered the most accurate translation of any book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus, the topic of my post:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact:&lt;/strong&gt; In the Book of Mormon, Jesus Christ comes to America to teach the Lost Tribes of Israel (3 &lt;span&gt;Nephi&lt;/span&gt;). In 3 &lt;span&gt;Nephi&lt;/span&gt; 13: 9 -13 Jesus is in America and teaching the &lt;span&gt;Nephites&lt;/span&gt; the same Lord’s Prayer. One reading this account will notice that this version of the Lord’s Prayer is the same prayer as in Matthew 6: 9-13 of the King James Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; If, as Joseph Smith claimed, the Book of Mormon is the uncorrupted and pure text / translation “translated” from the Golden Plates, then we should have a textual witness independent of the textual problems and corruptions of the standard Greek texts that make up the &lt;span&gt;Textus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Receptus&lt;/span&gt; (the bases for the 1611 King James Bible / New Testament) a received Greek text which has as been labeled by Bruce &lt;span&gt;Metzger&lt;/span&gt; has one with “blatant errors” (A Textual Commentary; p.10).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the United Bibles Society’s Greek New Testament (as well as the Nestle Aland Greek New Testament), the earliest witnesses confirm this prayer ends with the phase “but deliver us from evil.” and that the King James inclusion of the longer ending “For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen” is a redaction composed from I Chronicles 29: 11 - 13 “in order to adapt the Prayer for liturgical use in the early church.” (A Textual Commentary; p. 14). The certain criteria that the original text ended with “evil” was given an “A” rating by the U.B.S.G.N.T. 4ed. Textual Committee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I point this out to the mission elders of the &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Church, neither they nor their state mission president had an answer to the problem. However, they assured me that the Book of Mormon was not wrong, nor was it at this point simply Smith copying the Lord’s Prayer from the King James Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Elders told me that the scholars at the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies at Brigham Young University were the textual scholars who could answer my question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since this was a New Testament Greek textual question / problem, I decided to contact Professor Stephen Edward Robinson, PhD a Mormon scholar and apologist who is head of the department of Ancient Scripture at Brigham Young University. And since both Robinson and I were members of the Society of Biblical Literature, I could use the Society’s Member Handbook to get his office phone number.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I called Robinson’s faculty number at &lt;span&gt;BYU&lt;/span&gt; only to get a recording at which time I left my name, pone number and that I had a Book of Mormon question requesting him to kindly return my phone call. After a week and two unanswered requests for Professor Robinson to return my calls, I told the Elders that I was not having any luck with the Dept. of Ancient Scripture a &lt;span&gt;BYU&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the Elders told me that he could get the home phone number of Dr. Robinson (an unlisted number), but he wanted me to assure him he would remain anonymous (which I agreed to).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That night about 7:00 pm Utah time, I called Prof. Robinson’s home and got his wife. I told her that I had a textual question on the Book of Mormon in 3 &lt;span&gt;Nephi&lt;/span&gt; and would like to ask Dr. Robinson about it. Mrs. Robinson said he was not in at the time, but “may come in latter“. About and hour later I called again and got their five year old daughter (as listed in the faculty description). She told me she was alone and that both mommy and daddy were not there. As she paused for some time to give me more information, I could tell she was being coached as to what to say. I told her I hoped her mom and dad would return soon as she was too young to stay at home alone. In about forty-five minutes I called back and got Mrs. Robinson on the phone again. When I asked her if Prof. Robinson was there, she angrily stated he was not home and that “he is never coming home as for as you are concerned!” and hung up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I’m sure most all &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Mormons strongly believe the Book of Mormon is true and correct just as Joseph Smith claimed it to be (a true and perfect translation of what both the Lost Tribes of Israel and Jesus Christ said and did), the facts speak for themselves when a Temple Mormon family must lie to run from the truth (as the &lt;span&gt;Robinsons&lt;/span&gt; did), the world and claims created by the Prophet and Founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Satins can clearly be seen as a concocted “Made in America Religion” invented to give people in the early nineteenth century Burned Over District in up state New York a new direction in the confused world of the Bible and freedom of religion in the United States. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comments at the Vatican that are likely to provoke a furious reaction from homosexual groups, Benedict also warned that blurring the distinction between male and female could lead to the &lt;span&gt;"self-destruction"&lt;/span&gt; of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In his address to the Curia, the Vatican's central administration, he described behaviour beyond traditional heterosexual relations as &lt;span&gt;"a destruction of God's work"&lt;/span&gt; and said that the Roman Catholic Church had a duty to &lt;span&gt;"protect man from the destruction of himself"&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is not &lt;span&gt;"outmoded metaphysics" to urge respect for the &lt;span&gt;"nature of the human being as man and woman,"&lt;/span&gt; he added.
&lt;span&gt;"The tropical forests do deserve our protection. But man, as a creature, does not deserve any less."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang on, wait. So Catholics are like trees, and gay people are like chainsaws, or something? And the gays are engaged in clear-cutting church congregations?  Homosexuals are out to EXTERMINATE the whole HUMAN RACE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Catholic Church teaches that while homosexuality is not sinful, homosexual acts are. It opposes gay marriage and, in October, a leading Vatican official described homosexuality as &lt;span&gt;"a deviation, an irregularity, a wound"&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yeah. A chainsaw can do some pretty nasty damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a teenage boy, according to this joke, the idea of cleaning up his own messes is so alien that learning to understand its expression in simple English is part of learning a foreign language. I suspect that the stereotype is at least somewhat unfair, in terms of age as well as sex; but this comic strip also mocks (and thus illustrates) a common tendency to equate language and thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, as advanced by its original authors, involved the rather limited idea that the obligatory morpho-syntactic categories of a language influence the habitual thought patterns of its speakers. Even in this form, the hypothesis &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000129.html"&gt;remains controversial&lt;/a&gt;. But it's often distorted into various extreme and easily-refuted forms, such as the idea that a culture's interest in X can reliably be calibrated in terms of its number of monomorphemic words for X-related concepts; or worse, the truly bizarre idea that if you can't express a concept in a single word, then you can't understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why people fall into these fallacies, because there are closely-related concepts that are pretty clearly true. I encountered one example a few months ago in reading James Flynn's book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Beyond-Flynn-Effect/dp/0521880076/"&gt;What is Intelligence?&lt;/a&gt; (for the context, see "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=481"&gt;One question, two answers, three interpretations&lt;/a&gt;", 8/14/2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flynn writes (p. 146):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;IQ gains are less than half the story of the cognitive history of the twentieth century. There are other intellectual qualities, namely, critical acumen and wisdom, that IQ tests were not designed to measure and do not measure and these are equally worthy of attention. […]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;There is one encouraging development. Over the last century and a half, science and philosophy have invaded the language of educated people … by giving them words and phrases that can greatly increase their critical acumen. Each of these terms stands for a cluster of interrelated ideas that virtually spell out a method of critical analysis applicable to social and moral issues. I will call them shorthand abstractions (or SHAs), it being understood that they are abstractions with peculiar analytic significance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives a sort of top-ten list of SHAs along with "the date they entered educated usage" according to the OED. His list is &lt;em&gt;market&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;natural selection&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;control group&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;random sample&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;naturalistic fallacy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;charisma effect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;placebo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;falsifiable/tautology&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;tolerance school fallacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The last of these terms somewhat undermines Flynn's optimism about the historical trend, since it's his own invention, and as he wryly notes, "somehow my coining this term has not made it into common currency". It means "the fallacy of concluding that we should respect the good of all because nothing can be shown to be good".]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, Flynn's idea is that these words and phrases are the outward and visible sign of increasing "critical acumen and wisdom" in the culture that developed them. Some people will surely disagree, but I'm not among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I'd like to add a few things to Flynn's list, starting with a list of shorthand abstractions that have to do with ways of thinking and talking about properties of sets, and have been featured in many  Language Log posts over the years. The outward and visible signs of this set of interrelated concepts are terms like &lt;em&gt;odds ratio&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;percentile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;standard deviation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;effect size&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;contingency table&lt;/em&gt;. Here's an illustrative sample of relevant posts:  "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004767.html"&gt;Thou shalt not report odds ratios&lt;/a&gt;", 7/30/2007; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003607.html"&gt;Gabby guys: the effect size&lt;/a&gt;", 9/23/2006; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004987.html"&gt;The 'gender happiness gap'&lt;/a&gt;", 10/4/2007; &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004992.html"&gt;The Pirahã and us&lt;/a&gt;", 10/6/2007; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005422.html"&gt;Scrupulously avoiding sigma&lt;/a&gt;", 3/2/2008; "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005496.html"&gt;Is autism the symptom of an 'extreme white brain'?&lt;/a&gt;", 3/26/2008; "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=12"&gt;Steven D. Levitt: pwned by the base rate fallacy?&lt;/a&gt;", 4/10/2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these are all statistical terms, I'd argue that the associated concepts belong to linguistics in the same sense that the concepts developed by logicians for talking about truth and consequences do. (These include things like sense and reference, de re vs. de dicto, entailment, implicature, quantifier scope, and so on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial ways of thinking and talking about the properties of sets don't require anything beyond junior-high-school math to understand.  But the associated methods of critical analysis seem still to be mostly lacking among the sample of educated people represented by journalists in general, science journalists in particular, and even scientists writing for a general audience. As a result, genuine scientific results are garbled, and emerge as misleading or entirely false general statements that guide public policy choices as well decisions in private life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, you could argue that the net impact of statistical concepts on public discourse in our society has been negative. They underlie scientifically valid forms of argument, but the authority of these arguments is then abused in discussions among people who overwhelmingly misunderstand and misuse them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t go that far — statistical reasoning has surely done far more good than harm, overall —  but it&amp;#39;s certainly long past time to increase the percentage of the population that understands it. However, it probably takes just about as much systematic practice to get comfortable with these ways of thinking and talking about the properties of groups as it does to learn to count and do basic arithmetic. So we&amp;#39;d be talking about a fairly large change in our culture&amp;#39;s educational system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230045095292"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-96088503557170302.post-2649482363648062478">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0b0fffaca4b0e40b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Bad Science" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Soil Association" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="organic" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Can you just be a little bit organic?

You'll remember, no doubt, that The Soil Association awarded &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/feb/12/advertising.food"&gt;Gillian McKeith&lt;/a&gt; its Consumer Education Award 2005 - information the Soil Assoc has decided should no longer be &lt;a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/GlobalSearch?SearchView&amp;amp;SearchOrder=1&amp;amp;SearchWv=TRUE&amp;amp;SearchFuzzy=TRUE&amp;amp;SearchThesaurus=TRUE&amp;amp;Query=gillian%20mckeith"&gt;on their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Soil Association's current resident nutritionist, &lt;a href="http://www.whyorganic.org/healthy_nutritional.asp"&gt;Shaun Heaton&lt;/a&gt;, doesn't seem much better - cue &lt;a href="http://holfordwatch.info/2008/12/23/dara-o-briain-a-dietitian-is-to-a-nutritionist-as-a-dentist-is-to-a-toothiologist/"&gt;Dara O'Briain's nutritionist gag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lines like:&lt;blockquote&gt;Organic food contains fewer pesticide residues. []. Don’t wait, as unfortunately many people do, to get diagnosed with cancer before you get interested in real food.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Interesting reasoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Organic food contains no artificial additives such as sweeteners or colours, which a major new study has now unequivocally linked to hyperactivity, learning and behavioural problems in children.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Unlike those nasty aspartame carrots that are all the rage? &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Organic food contains more nutrients, as confirmed again by the largest study of its kind just released, showing 20-80% more nutrients in organics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nutrition.org.uk/home.asp?siteId=43&amp;amp;sectionId=782&amp;amp;subSectionId=323&amp;amp;parentSection=299&amp;amp;which="&gt;British Nutrition Foundation&lt;/a&gt; would say otherwise:&lt;blockquote&gt;• There is no evidence to show that crops grown organically have a better nutrient content than those produced non-organically. However, it has been acknowledged that little research has been conducted to date and much of the available scientific information is out-dated or based on inadequate study design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically, the cost of organic food has been considerably higher than ordinary food, but this gap has closed significantly over the last number of years. Food prices in general have risen and with the current economic credit crunch, people are tightening their belts. &lt;br&gt;What will be first against the wall? People's principals. So much so, according to &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/article5380546.ece"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;, that organic farmers are lobbying government to allow them to take an Organic Holiday, so that they can buy the much cheaper ordinary feed during these hard times. According the newspaper:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sales of organic food slumped 10 per cent in the 12 weeks up to the end of November, according to the latest figures from the consumer researchers TNS. Overall food sales over the same period were up 6 per cent &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;To me, this idea is nonsense. One concept that has been used frequently with organic farming is the idea of sustainability. Usually this has been in the context of biodiversity, protection of hedgerows, maintaining the wildlife equilibrium etc - all good things, but in fact, of questionable importance if the food you are producing is not commercially viable. You end up with less 'conventional' land to provide more food. Sustainability means being able to sustain your business during tough times. How on earth can you forgo your principals? I don't think they'll be given leave to do this - the main problem I see is that it will be a PR disaster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, you are offending your True Believers™, the people who have completely bought into the Organic Religion. They will not tolerate a change to the Holy Book, and it could lead to a split. The word 'organic' will lose its meaning and brand identity (Chemists would argue this has already happened once).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, you've already lost the people fleeing to Lidl who weren't true believers, and now that they've been away, it'll be difficult to get them back. The beliefs of animal welfare and no pesticides were 'nice thoughts' for them, perhaps they bought organic as a social status symbol or because they had a few extra pennies. I would have thought someone buying organic would be subject to some sort of cognitive dissonance if they went back to normal food. How could they justify their previous lavish expense? Can they really taste a difference? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How many of the farmers are True Believers™ and how many converted to organic because at one time it was a lucrative business move? Can these farmers be trusted to maintain the scrupulous organic standards when bills are stacking up and produce is not going out of the gate? This is not to characterise farmers as underhanded, merely to present the situation as being a truly difficult decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.organicfarmers.org.uk/news/news_more.php?id=185"&gt;Organic Farmers and Growers&lt;/a&gt; statement on the Times story, no approach has yet been made to DEFRA, although they do state:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is, however, fair to say that the broad aims would be to allow farmland to remain organic, even if the animals on it were to be fed on non-organic rations for a limited time, thereby enforcing the removal of the animals from the organic system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;So you can have organic farmland, with normal livestock on it eating normal foodstock and when times get better, jump back into the Organic circle. Normal farmers trying to get into organic farming have to maintain their land as organic for three years before they get the cert. If you are in the year 2 of your 3 year run, does it count? IF so, it makes a mockery of the whole 3 year hoop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without any sense of irony, the OGF finish their statement with the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The industry’s aim is to protect the organic system for the welfare and environmental benefits it brings and ensure that progress made in expanding this sustainable method of farming is not lost.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's that 'sustainable' word again. Allow me to translate&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The industry's aim is to sustain the unsustainable.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-2649482363648062478?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230044374088"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=944">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b7cf329d1d5ddd48</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language and politics"/><category term="Language and the media"/><category term="Pragmatics"/><category term="Semantics"/><category term="Syntax"/><title type="html">Probably they shouldn't</title><published>2008-12-23T14:57:14Z</published><updated>2008-12-23T14:57:14Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=944" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003983.html"&gt;Verb phrase ellipsis in English&lt;/a&gt; normally requires an overt linguistic antecedent of approximately the right morphological form.

I generally say “spend as much money as the Creationists”, in the hope that one day someone finally will, but there’s another answer which is simply “don’t”. Skepticism as a label, a methodology, is never going to be mainstream. It’s a lot of work to critically appraise every claim you come across, and most people simply can’t be bothered. There are benefits, particularly when assessing medical or financial claims, but on the whole the general public doesn’t really care whether psychics are cold reading, and doesn’t get angry about The Secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;I think, though, that it would be fair to say many people don’t care because they aren’t aware they’re being scammed, and to what degree. Homeopathy is the best example of that. Ever hear “well if it was bogus then it would be illegal”? Some people find out they’re being scammed and still indulge (&lt;a href="http://www.michaelshermer.com/2007/11/con-games-part-1/"&gt;see this video&lt;/a&gt;), and those people might never learn and don’t want to. Or, as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Minchin"&gt;Tim Minchin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;said this Sunday, “we might as well be ten minutes back in time for all the chance you’ll change your mind”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;If I mangled Tim’s quote, forgive me, but the sentiment stands, and more importantly that lengthy intro segues messily into my review of 9 Lessons and Carols for Godless People, a comedy, music and science event at which the aforequoted Minchin performed his nine-minute beat poem ‘Storm’, by far the wittiest and most charming assault on alternative medicine and other woo I’ve ever seen. Given it was perfect, I shan’t harp on about it, as there’s more fun to be had in praising the unique moments and slagging off the flaws.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;The event itself was held on Thurs and Fri at a 400-seater theatre in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;London&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt; and then on Sunday at the massive Hammersmith Apollo for 3500 people, which is where we rejoin my intro and discuss bringing skepticism to the mainstream. This event was stealth education, conceived by comedian &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Ince"&gt;Robin Ince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;as a secular celebration, proving that atheists have not declared war on Christmas and like a good pull as much as the next man (I mean &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_crackers"&gt;Christmas crackers&lt;/a&gt;, but am fully aware that they don’t exist in the USA so really the innuendo is just plain old ‘rude’).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Gaining momentum, the original idea was expanded to include a second night, and then the massive Apollo date which is probably the largest secular-Christmas-themed-gathering-featuring-Richard-Dawkins-and-also-some-guy-with-a-guitar of its kind. Probably. And this is where the real celebration comes in. Nothing is worse than those ham-fisted attempts at “hey kidz, science is kewl!” projects, which miss their mark (because real science is mostly sitting at a desk with a pencil and paper, and not as full of explosions and custard as science communicators want kidz to believe), and I was relieved to see that there was no attempt to patronise. Yes, the lineup included some of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Britain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;’s biggest ‘celebrity’ comedians (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais"&gt;Ricky Gervais&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_O&amp;#39;Brien"&gt;Dara O’Brien&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Minchin et al), but there wasn’t a hint of ‘ooh look what we’ve done, we’ve put cool people in with scientists, isn’t that funky?’. In fact, the comedians turned out to be the biggest geeks of the night, skeptics and atheists and science fans one and all. Math, evolution and physics jokes abounded, which was delightful to hear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/225px-josie_long-199x300.jpg" alt="Josie Long" width="119" height="180"&gt;My favourite moment in that vein was when &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_Long"&gt;Josie Long&lt;/a&gt;, a 26-year-old comedienne and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Oxford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt; graduate, bounded onstage, told a joke about fractions, told another joke about philosophy of which the punchline was mostly swearing, then bounded off again. As you know, I’m not really into the whole Oprah ‘vagina-owners are all sisters’ thing, but I wanted to grab Josie Long and give her the geek girl hug of my life. Or as one Skepchick commenter said recently “where were you when I was alone at school?!”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;I won’t talk too much about the other speakers, as many of the names will be meaningless to you and others are old friends of Skepchick with whom you are already familiar (Ben Goldacre, Simon Singh). This review is more a seasonal warm fuzzy than a post-mortem, hence:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;The other ‘best’ moment was one not available to those who went to the small gigs. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Cocker"&gt;Jarvis Cocker&lt;/a&gt;, former singer with indie band &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_(band)"&gt;Pulp&lt;/a&gt; (did you have them in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;?) has both a mainstream &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt; a cult following here, which is quite an achievement. He came onstage to rapturous applause, performed one of his own songs then a really touching-but-ironic cover of Greg Lake’s I Believe in Father Christmas (you know the one, it has war in it. No, not that one, that’s the Lennon thing). It was an inspired choice of song, originally being a protest at commercialisation but becoming a hit anyway, and Mr Cocker performed it beautifully. That’s not the ‘best’ moment though. The ‘best’ moment was the well-deserved thunderous cheering and clapping as he left the stage, which I thought would surely be the biggest cheer of the night, only to hear it &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; when the next act, Richard Dawkins, was announced to the stage. Yep, Dawkins is a bigger rock star than a rock star. Science truly was cool at that moment, with no custard involved. The lights dimmed, the stage illuminated by a starry backdrop, he gave three readings in what a cliché would insist are dulcet tones (I prefer to think of it as ‘The Attenborough Effect’), and the audience was captivated.&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/richarddawkins1-150x150.jpg" alt="Richard D" width="150" height="150"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Indeed, it was the joining of scientists with comedians and musicians that must have been the cause of an interesting phenomenon: students were at the gig &lt;em&gt;with their parents&lt;/em&gt;. I saw this several times, lads with their middle-class schoolteacher-type moms, goth chicks with their Oxford-scarf wearing dads. Where else does this happen? Something for everyone, which is surely the true spirit of Christmas and, along with ‘stealth education’, the greatest achievement of 9 Lessons and Carols for Godless People.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;I did say that I’d slag off the flaws, but that seems a bit bah humbug, so instead I’ll leave you with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Greg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Lake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;’s awesome song &lt;a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gq54OSEmJ44"&gt;http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gq54OSEmJ44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And yet, when you look around, no one was there? This is a common experience, which researchers call a “sensed presence.” Neuroscientists hypothesize that this common experience likely has a neurological correlate - meaning that activity in some specific part of the brain is responsible for generating the sensation of a presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, research has validated that hypothesis. And recently the research team of Michael Persinger had the fortune of capturing a &lt;a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2008/12/spontaneous-experience-of-sensed.html"&gt;sensed presence event on EEG&lt;/a&gt; (which measures the electrical activity of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subject is a woman who has had numerous episodes of sensed presence after a head injury. Persinger now presents a case report of her EEG, recorded while she experienced the sense of a man in the room with her when none was present. For some reason as yet unknown, 90% of time a sensed presence is of a member of the opposite sex. The EEG shows a burst of electrical activity in her left temporal lobe during the event, and of note she perceived the presence to be on her right side.  (Brain activity corresponds to the contralateral or opposite side of the world.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This confirms prior evidence. Persinger &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12193838"&gt;previously published evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing that the incidence of a sensed presence could be manipulated in subjects by using transcranial magnetic stimuation. When applied to both temporal lobe or the right temporal lobe the incidence was greater than when applied to only the left temporal lobe or when a sham stimulation was done as a control. He postulates that perhaps a sensed presence occurs when there is a glitch in the communication between the two temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persinger with another researcher, Tiller, showed that induced sensed presences tend to&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11883572?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=2&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt; occur opposite the side of the brain&lt;/a&gt; being stimulated, as with the subject in this recent case report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persinger and another lead author, Cook, were able to induce the experience of a sensed presence in 9 of 15 volunteers in &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9347559?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=3&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;another experiment&lt;/a&gt; using magnetic stimulation. Of interest, one of the subjects had a history of “psychicaly” reading medical diagnoses from photographs. They reported that they would get flashes of visions in their left upper visual field. Cook and Persinger document that they were able to increase the frequency of these experiences by applying the magnetic stimulation in a blinded fashion. They also document that when a subject tries to look at or focus on the location of the presence it moves or evades their gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line of research has significant implications for anyone interested in the paranormal or mystical experiences. The experience of sensing a presence that is not physically there often triggers mystical interpretations - as is likely what happened with the “psychic” subject in the previous study. Often times the presence is given divine significance. Most people assume that whatever they experience is real (especially if are not intoxicated or if there is no other simple explanation at hand). They therefore will make sense of their experiences within their belief systems or world view. We see this happen also with the phenomenon of hypnagogic hallucinations (waking dreams), which in the past have been interpreted as demonic visitations but recently are more likely to be seen as alien abductions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16051550?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;amp;linkpos=3&amp;amp;log$=relatedarticles&amp;amp;logdbfrom=pubmed"&gt;Persinger also showed &lt;/a&gt;that low level magnetic fields may induce the experience of a sensed presence. He postulates that geological activity, which can generate these low level magnetic field, may be responsible for mass hallucinations in areas with a lot of activity. Or at least increase the incidence of experiencing a sensed presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding that our brains are electrochemical machines, albeit highly complex ones, liberates us from grasping at mystical explanations for brain-derived experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

It's already here! It's been lurking about for a few years now, and &lt;a title="The Latest Face of Creationism in the Classroom: Scientific American" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-latest-face-of-creationism&amp;amp;print=true"&gt;Glenn Branch and Eugenie Scott discuss the new tactic at some length&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magic words are, of course, "academic freedom". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those words in the hands of creationists are used the way Republicans name bills: exactly contrary to the actual content. &amp;quot;Academic freedom&amp;quot; bills have been getting pushed into legislatures all across the country by — you guessed it — Christian evangelicals who see them as a tool to inject biblical creationism into the public school curriculum under the guise of fairness and high intellectual standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Florida, for example, a representative of the Discovery Institute dithered when asked whether intelligent design constituted "scientific information" in the sense of the bill, saying, "In my personal opinion, I think it does. But the intent of this bill is not to settle that question," and adding, unhelpfully, "The intent of this bill is ... it protects the 'teaching of scientific information.'" Similarly, during debate on the Senate floor, the bill's sponsor was noticeably reluctant to address the question of whether it would license the teaching of creationism, preferring instead to simply recite its text.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thus, despite the lofty language, the ulterior intent and likely effect of these bills are evident: undermining the teaching of evolution in public schools--a consequence only creationists regard as a blessing. Unfortunately, among their numbers are teachers. A recent national survey conducted by researchers at Pennsylvania State University reveals that one in eight U.S. high school biology teachers already presents creationism as a "valid scientific alternative to Darwinian explanations for the origin of species," with about the same percentage emphasizing that "many reputable scientists" view creationism as a scientifically valid alternative to evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So be prepared, this is the new strategy: creationists will be openly superficial and nebulous in order to steal away the necessary rigor of our public school systems. And once science has been reduced to a floppy, useless pile of vacuous blather in their hands, they can insert any old nonsense they want…and the products of those schools, the next generation of parents and voters, will be too ignorant to oppose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, A has proven herself to be a strong, independent woman who gets things done. Her first role here was taking on the Skepchick &amp;amp; Skepdude calendars when I didn’t think I’d have the time to produce them for 2008/2009. I didn’t think anyone would be able to handle the job, much less to work so hard at coming up with fresh ideas and to keep going even when I wasn’t there to push. She recently started editing our new Skepchick podcasts (the most recent of which will be debuting very soon), and as always she’s shown incredible talent and enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s not just about her work ethic – to succeed as an awesome Skepchick, you need something more. A is vivacious, lighting up the room (or the bar) with her smile, her laugh, her quick wit. I know I speak for all the other Skepchicks – and all others who value rationality in general – when I say we’re proud to have her on our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, congratulations to A for getting a sweet gig, and congratulations to the JREF for getting a sweet Skepchick!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1230003139662"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2799266022670347008">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1333eece952cce36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science Journalism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Who the Heck Is George Johnson?</title><published>2008-12-23T02:58:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-23T03:45:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/who-heck-is-george-johnson.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2799266022670347008/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2799266022670347008" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> A few weeks ago I wrote about Epigenetics at SEED.

It's hard to make them see what we do, or to think like we think. People who are poles apart sometimes don't even use the same language. We dispute each other's facts. We have different control beliefs. We live in different intellectual universes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The differences might be like a mountain climber who expects some person off the street to join him in climbing up Mt. Everest, or a skydiver who does tricks who expects a novice to do the same. Such things are far beyond someone not already used to doing likewise. It takes training and work and time, plenty off it. No one can expect someone to think of doing likewise, much less do it. That person might even be scared of heights! It takes baby steps. One must crawl before he can walk. And one must walk before he can run. And one must run before he can climb, and so on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evangelical Christians recoil from our arguments. They don't trust us. For most of them we represent the devil. A friend of mine read my book but before each time she said a prayer that God would not let her be deceived by what was in it, and you know what, she walked away still believing. Surprise! Maybe some Christian visitors do the same whenever coming here to DC, who knows. Some come to do battle against the forces of evil. They're not open to what we have to say at all. Why? Because of the distance between us and the trust factor. They "know" we're wrong from the get go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's nothing that can be done about this. It's just the way it is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just want to remind everyone that there is some sort of continuum of beliefs and the choices are not limited to just evangelical Christianity and Atheism (as defined). There are a whole range of intermediate religious views between us. This is nothing new, of course, but a reminder of this is good. Why? Because the range of Christianity begins way over to the right, with snake handlers and the KKK (yes, they claim to be Christians), to the Fred Phelps hate group, to King James version only Christians, to Bob Jones University, to non-instrumental Churches of Christ, to Pentecostals like Pat Robertson, to Evangelical minded (who often distance themselves from others to their right), to open theists, to liberal Christians of various sorts who can be described as existentialists, mainline Christians, Episcopal Bishop John Shelby Spong types, feminists, panentheists like Marcus Borg, Liberation Theology, and Universalists. There are Arminian, Calvinist and Catholic versions of these types of Christianities, I presume. Then there are Deists, agnostics, and Atheists. This is quite a long, varied continuum of beliefs. One could probably start out a snake handler and with more and more reading go through several of the stages of thinking over the years and became an atheist. Hardly ever does the trend reverse itself, although there are probably a few rare cases, I presume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens when one thinks through a theology and moves to the left isn't usually because he read a book out of bounds of what's considered possible. I remember reading John Gibson's commentary on &lt;em&gt;Genesis 1-11 &lt;/em&gt;and rejecting it outright because it was too far from what I would consider possible. I have now come to embrace his conclusions. The stories of Genesis 1-11 are parabolic stories, myths. As I moved from being a Pentecostal to an evangelical to a liberal to a panentheist to a deist then an agnostic and finally an atheist I would only consider those books that challenged me and they were just a bit to the left of where I was. Anything farther away than that would throw up all kinds of red flags in my head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, if Christians here don't want to take the &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/11/take-debunking-christianity-challenge.html"&gt;Debunking Christianity Challenge&lt;/a&gt; because it's too far removed from what you consider a possibility due to the fact that you don't trust atheist authors, then do what I did. Read books that challenge your thinking by Christian authors outside your safe zone. Read open theist literature. Read liberal Christian books. If you're in college, study with professors who will challenge your faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember when considering which seminary to attend many people thought I should go to &lt;em&gt;Cincinnati Bible Seminary&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;Lincoln Christian Seminary&lt;/em&gt; because the liberals were there. But I went anyway and didn't find any liberals there at all! Then I went to &lt;em&gt;Trinity Evangelical Divinity School &lt;/em&gt;and was told that such a college was outside the bounds of my own denomination, so to be careful, that some liberals were there who didn't think the way Church of Christ people did. But they were conservatives after all. Then I finally attended &lt;em&gt;Marquette University &lt;/em&gt;and I finally met the liberals. But more and more I found the arguments to the left of where I was at much better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So here's a challenge to conservative Christians. How do you know you're right about that which you were raised to believe? Challenge yourself to read outside your safe zone. See why these authors think the way that they do. You'll find they have some good arguments. See if your beliefs can withstand their arguments. There are a host of &lt;em&gt;Zondervan &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Inter-Varsity Press &lt;/em&gt;books that have four or five views of certain issues from the millennium to women to apologetics to hell to creation to atonement theories to sanctification to salvation to the Bible, and so on. Read them all, one at a time for starters. In my case my beliefs changed in the face of these other books and articles and professors. It was slow, and I faced a crisis. But the conservative Christian arguments are less than persuasive in the Christian literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason I wrote my book is because I could not answer the arguments of the people to my left. I am an atheist because atheists have the best arguments down the line. Atheism is the position of last resort. Once all other views are eliminated it’s the one to fall back on. I would never have considered it unless I went through several theology changes by reading authors I could trust. Try it. Challenge your beliefs, not by our writings, if that’s too much to ask. Read authors outside your safe zone. If you’re a conservative then read the books of moderates. If you’re a moderate then read the books of the liberals. If you’re a liberal, then read atheist literature. See what happens. Keep stretching your mind. Do not simply read literature that you’re comfortable with. That’s not a challenge at all. Challenge yourself. See if your present views as a conservative can withstand this challenge. They didn’t with me. I suspect you’ll find it won’t with you. Test your beliefs. How do you know your theology is correct? The only way is to test it with other authors just a bit farther to your left. This is my challenge to you. It may be the best challenge I can lay down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

While we mainly focus on new books, we include a couple of new editions of older books, and of course, our previous reviews might still be of some interest (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/realclimate-recommended-reading/"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/05/my-review-of-books/"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/12/books-07/"&gt;2007&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uCLx6DorL.jpg" align="left" width="30%" style="padding-right:10px"&gt;The prize for the most optimistic title this year goes to Wally Broecker, for "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fixing-Climate-Changes-Current-Threat/dp/080904501X"&gt;Fixing Climate&lt;/a&gt;" (written mainly by Robert Kunzig). This is a book written in a particular style -  a number of recent advances in relevant paleo-climate (abrupt changes, mega-droughts, etc.) are examined through the lens of a single scientist and their one key measurement or observation. This makes for a good narrative, but without wishing to take anything away from the great science discussed or the individual insights, it's only a partial picture of how these interesting ideas actually took root and got validated by the wider community. The climate fix the book ends up backing is a scheme for the air capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (discussed &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/03/air-capture/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081217/full/news.2008.1319.html?s=news_rss"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The technology is fascinating, but at over a couple of hundred $/per ton CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the economics are a long way from being viable. But read about it for yourselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also dwelling on paleo-climate is Chris Turney's &lt;a href="http://www.christurney.com/Home/Ice,_Mud_and_Blood.html"&gt;Ice, Mud and Blood&lt;/a&gt;. Eric reviewed this for &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/climate/2008/0808/full/climate.2008.71.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, noting that "Turney is by no means the first to try to articulate the point that  paleoclimatology has lessons for our future. Richard Alley's The Two-Mile Time Machine and Mark Bowen's Thin Ice, to name just two, have made the same basic arguments. But Turney's book is the most up to date, and I would certainly recommend it to colleagues, who will enjoy it and may well learn something new, as I did."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YkM6aYYsL.jpg" align="right" width="25%"&gt;Finally, it is definitely worth paying attention to books that may have been out for a while, or in a new edition. We were particularly impressed with Richard Somerville's award-winning introduction to understanding environmental change "&lt;a href="http://www.theforgivingair.com/"&gt;The Forgiving Air&lt;/a&gt;" which has just been re-issued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another notable paperback this year was from Joe Romm (of &lt;a href="http://climateprogress.org/"&gt;Climateprogress.org&lt;/a&gt;). His "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hell-High-Water-Warming-Politics/dp/006117212X"&gt;Hell and High Water&lt;/a&gt;" is mostly focused on policy solutions. As is a new book by Jay Inslee and Bracken Hendricks "&lt;a href="http://www.apollosfire.net/"&gt;Apollo's Fire&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Congressman Inslee has been known to pass by RealClimate now and again.  It does worry us a bit that the very first chapter refers to our friend and colleague Cecelia Bitz — a noted sea ice expert at the University of Washington — as &amp;#39;Carol&amp;#39;, and we hope that this is not indicative of the fact-checking care in the book. It looks to be an interesting contribution to the discussion of U.S. climate policy and it is especially timely to have a serious book on solutions to the problems in the Middle East, climate change, and the economy, all rolled into one. We look forward to reading this more closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, we are far too modest to mention our own &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/01/our-books/"&gt;humble offerings&lt;/a&gt;…. &lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to suggest other interesting titles in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

That was their Falcon 1, a small rocket that can carry a decent payload into orbit. Their next-gen rocket, &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon9.php"&gt;the Falcon 9&lt;/a&gt;, is where the big payoff is; it can launch 12 tons to low-Earth orbit, or well over 4 tons to a geostationary transfer orbit (a highly elliptical path where on-board thrusters on the payload can circularize the orbit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got word that the first Falcon 9 will be fully assembled at Cape Canaveral by the end of the year! Here is a shot of the first stage being lifted off the truck and prepped for &amp;quot;vertical integration&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/assets/img/122208-cranes2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/falcon9stack.jpg" alt="The Falcon 9 stack arriving at Florida"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool. They don’t say when they’ll be ready for launch, but I suspect we don’t have to wait very long. A few months? We’ll see. Until then, &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/updates.php"&gt;stay up to date at the SpaceX site&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229990495044"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/they_must_be_exideas.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8ba59f898728cbf0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">They must be ex-ideas</title><published>2008-12-22T22:56:37Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T22:56:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/492629903/they_must_be_exideas.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/they_must_be_exideas.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Allen MacNeill makes an interesting observation: those little eruptions of ID creationism on college campuses, the &lt;a title="THE EVOLUTION LIST: The &amp;quot;Intelligent Design&amp;quot; Movement on College and University Campuses is Dead" href="http://evolutionlist.blogspot.com/2008/12/intelligent-design-movement-on-college.html"&gt;Idea Centers, all seem to be moribund&lt;/a&gt;, and he pronounces the college ID movement dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quite agree. I think Intelligent Design as a whole is a zombie philosophy at this point — it&amp;#39;s dead, its brain is rotting, and it has no glamor or appeal to most people anymore. It&amp;#39;s still shuffling about, and it will continue to get mentioned now and then as people struggle to find some pretense of a non-religious motive for creationism, but really, we&amp;#39;re all just waiting for someone with a metaphorical shotgun to put it down with a metaphorical blast to its metaphorical head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that &lt;i&gt;creationism&lt;/i&gt; is dead. It's still thriving on college campuses. Look at all the openly religious campus organizations, like Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and various other faith organizations, and you'll still find anti-evolution high on their agendas.

This is his prize for &amp;quot;divisive, bitter and intemperate left-wing rhetoric&amp;quot;, named after Michael Moore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clearly intends it to be disparaging, but I find it to be a curiously misapplied award. First, it&amp;#39;s named for Michael Moore, who really isn&amp;#39;t that awful — he&amp;#39;s usually &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;, for one thing. For another, his counterpoint on the right is the Malkin Award, and I'm afraid that if he thinks a deranged harpy on the right is equivalent to a controversial but clearly progressive film maker on the left, his scales are a bit unbalanced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I'm in competition with Gore Vidal? I am not worthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps similarly, the list of nominees is a real hodge-podge, and hard to take seriously. The only qualifications seem to be that they said something that pissed off conservative Andrew Sullivan, and that they're nominally lumped together in the fuzzy blur of "The Left".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don’t doubt that I’m doing the right thing - especially now.  Our household is pretty tight on cash this year. From what I hear, money is tight in most households. Moose is too young to understand Santa/no Santa (really, if it’s not a dog or Spider-Man, he doesn’t care anyway) so it’s not a big deal yet, but I started wondering about other kids… would a kid whose parents have been laid-off or had their wages cut think that he was bad when he got fewer presents this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parents: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you telling your kids this year? If you are telling them that there is a Santa, how do you explain it when their friends and classmates get more/bigger or fewer/smaller gifts? If you’re telling them there is no Santa, how do you deal with the fact that other kids around them do believe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Non-Parents&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;If you don’t have kids, what do you think you’d tell them if you did? What if your favorite kid (a niece or nephew or your friend’s kid) came up and asked you, “What’s the truth about Santa Claus?” What would you say or what would you &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to say?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elyse</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229976335303"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/22/the-glass-closet/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c8c02fa00c632c2e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">The Glass Closet</title><published>2008-12-22T20:02:07Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T20:02:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/22/the-glass-closet/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://astrodyke.blogspot.com/2008/12/long-article-on-lgbtq-scientists-in.html"&gt;AstroDyke&lt;/a&gt; linked to an article at Science Magazine called &lt;a href="http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2008_12_05/science.opms.r0800063"&gt;&amp;quot;Shattering the Glass Closet&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, about the LGBT folks in science careers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rochelle Diamond sounds like someone I’d like. She said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond believes—despite the difficulties she’s experienced—that it is much better to be openly gay in the workplace than not. “It is an advantage to be out, because when you are out you quickly find the people who are accepting of you and those who aren’t. Then you can decide to go where you are accepted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seems like a rip-the-bandaid-off-quickly kind of person. I can see where she’s coming from; sometimes it’s a good strategy to see right away who’s on your side and who isn’t. Sadly, it could also be political suicide, and when your career is on the line that’s a pretty gutsy method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at my days in grad school, I didn’t know too many openly gay people; a few friends of mine were gay (whom I knew about at least), but they preferred that others not know, or just didn’t talk about it. It’s interesting to see that in some cases things are getting better diversity-wise and acceptance-wise, but clearly (cough cough Prop 8 cough cough) this country still has a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229976052805"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/isnt_it_cool_what_you_can_find.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92a35b4a176baec6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Organisms"/><title type="html">Isn't it cool what you can find in the sea?</title><published>2008-12-22T19:02:33Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T19:02:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/492464755/isnt_it_cool_what_you_can_find.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/isnt_it_cool_what_you_can_find.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I weren't so heavily invested in the cephalopods, &lt;a title="

Of course, this isn’t a regular list of jackasses, oh, no.

&lt;h2&gt;10. Oprah Winfrey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/6592/220pxoprahwinfrey282004qe9.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, Oprah didn’t really do &lt;em&gt;that much&lt;/em&gt; to annoy me this year. I mean, compared to previous years, when we had to put up with bullshit like The Secret, aka the Law of Attraction, which is still enjoying popularity amongst certain subsets of the American public. This year was mostly filled with her endorsement of Dr. Oz, a credulous surgeon who somehow managed to get a degree from a reputable university before marrying a reiki practitioner and rejecting everything he ever learned about clinical studies, science, and/or integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oz appears on Oprah wearing scrubs, which is shorthand for “don’t ask questions, just trust me.” Early in 2008, Dr. Oz appeared on Oprah to laud “alternative medicine,” in general, as the “globalization of medicine.” Bob Carroll did a great job dissecting his craziness &lt;a href="http://skepdic.com/skeptimedia/skeptimedia5.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah’s helping Dr. Oz get his own platform to spread misinformation, so look forward to him gaining his own spot next year. In the meantime, this slot goes to Oprah, since Dr. Oz is just one part of her zany world of superstition. Want more? Check out this tutorial, &lt;a href="http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/health/wellnessandprevention/20081201_webmd_sohhomeopathy"&gt;All About Homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;, which is distinguished by not containing more than 10% of actual true reality-based facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. The View&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3f/The_View_Title_Card.jpg/280px-The_View_Title_Card.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right: five women, one show, one giant jackass. To be fair, I think Barbara Walters is intelligent, strong, and generally kick-ass. Joy Behar has her moments of good humor and rationality. Whoopie Goldberg, is, well, there. So why doesn’t this popular talk show work? Why doesn’t it make me proud to be a woman? Because they’ve taken care to “balance” their panel with two complete idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Hasselbeck is famous because she was on a reality show. This year, she gave a glowing introduction to Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, making it not at all surprising that she shares Palin’s uneducated views on science. Combine her idiocy with that of Sherri Shepherd, a fundamentalist Christian “comedian” &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=715"&gt;who last year said she wasn’t sure if the world was flat&lt;/a&gt;, and what do you get? “Evolution is false because of designer handbags.” Kill me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. &lt;strong&gt;Kevin Trudeau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/12/Kevin_Trudeau.JPG/280px-Kevin_Trudeau.JPG" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch late-night infomercials, you’ve probably seen Kevin peddling all sorts of products “THEY” don’t want you to know about: namely, natural cures, weight loss cures, and debt cures. The last of those is probably the one he’s most interested in these days, considering that he &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4303"&gt;was just fined $5 million by the FTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to that recent slapdown, Kevin already had a rap sheet straight out of &lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: Special Douchebags Unit&lt;/em&gt;. Larceny, credit card fraud, pyramid schemes, class-action lawsuits, contempt of court – a lesser (read: more moral) man would have given up by the third or fourth lawsuit and settled down to a long career as stockboy at the local Stop &amp;amp; Shop. Not our Kevin, though! He continued advertising his useless and sometimes dangerous products, leading to the $5 million judgment for flat out lying about some of his weight-loss cures. My favorite is that Kev says once you complete the course, you can eat whatever you want, but Phase 4 of the course literally goes on for the rest of your life. Ha, sneaky. Apparently not sneaky enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Bill Donohue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Catholic Jackass" src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5388/billdonohuesa1.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="146"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you got paid to be a jackass? Like, specifically, that’s your job. You show up at work and you surf the ‘net for awhile, looking for something to be insulted by. Some days you really have to work hard, like finding insults in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_Us_(song)"&gt;pop song&lt;/a&gt; about love and forgiveness. Other days, it’s easier, like when a &lt;a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2007/Catholic_group_fires_back_at_leaders_0406.html"&gt;popular cartoon show&lt;/a&gt; depicts you being ripped in two by your own deity. Now that’s insulting! Fire off a letter to a network or maybe the FCC and ka-ching, your bank account grows. That’s right: you are Bill Donohue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill reached new heights of shrillness this year by helping create one of the stupidest controversies ever: &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1758"&gt;Crackergate&lt;/a&gt;. The short story is this: a kid in Florida walks out of Mass holding a Eucharist wafer. Bill Donohue calls it a hate crime. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/its_a_goddamned_cracker.php"&gt;PZ Myers says it’s silly&lt;/a&gt; and offers to personally desecrate a wafer to prove it’s no big deal. Bill Donohue &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1459"&gt;freaks the fuck out&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of insulted Catholics call for PZ’s head, sometimes &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/mail_dump.php"&gt;a little too literally&lt;/a&gt;. PZ kept his job and never got his brains beaten in as threatened, Bill got plenty of the attention he desired, the world kept turning, and transubstantiation is still a myth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the thrill of Crackergate slowly dissipated, Bill cheered himself with the notion that soon the &lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/video-search/m/21416450/war_on_christmas.htm"&gt;War on Christmas would begin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ka-ching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Matthias Rath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img181.imageshack.us/img181/2755/codex2004rathlecture01wp2.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthias Rath sold vitamin pills that he claimed could cure AIDS, which, let’s face it, pretty much guarantees him a place on any list of jackasses worth its salt. Rath peddled his pseudoscience in South Africa, where every day 1,000 people die of AIDS, which pretty much guarantees him a place on the shuttle bus to a special level of hell if only such a thing actually existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthias distinguished himself further this year by bringing a million-pound libel suit against our friend Ben Goldacre and The Guardian, for an article that explained all the above to the general public. This suit was &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/matthias-rath-pulls-out-forced-to-pay-the-guardians-costs-i-think-this-means-i-win/"&gt;dropped this past September&lt;/a&gt; forcing him to pay the Guardian’s legal fees (up to a half-million pounds), making Matthias a dangerous nuisance, an obvious con artist, and ultimately, a total loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Bernie Madoff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Financial Jackass" src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/9458/madoffcp5994565qd3.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="320"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit there’s something fleetingly romantic about the old-fashioned financial con. Maybe I’ve watched too many David Mamet movies, because in my imagination Bernie Madoff’s a fast-talking trickster in a fedora with an admirably cunning wit, but in reality I know that he’s a jackass scammer. Madoff recently pulled off the largest Ponzi scheme in history by abusing the trust and exploiting the greed of an incredible swath of the population, earning himself about $50 billion before his kids turned him in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, a Ponzi scheme is your basic pyramid scam: people pay to get in, and they get paid back with a portion of what later “investors” pay. The few at the top of the pyramid make gobs of money, but after only a few levels, it becomes literally impossible to find enough people to enlist to pay back those above them. The scam is illegal, but many companies get around it by offering actual products that “investors” sell, like Herbalife and Amway, and probably any company that hosts parties at your neighbor’s houses. These are varying degrees of scamminess, depending upon how much money is made through actual sales compared to how much comes in through people buying in to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovable carney Todd Robbins recently bestowed upon Bernie “&lt;a href="http://modernconman.blogspot.com/2008/12/we-have-winner.html"&gt;The Largest Investor Swindle Ever by a Single Individual&lt;/a&gt;” Award, recommending that you read up on the guy who started it all in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ponzi-Incredible-Financial-Library-Larceny/dp/0767914996/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1229359711&amp;amp;sr=8-2"&gt;Ponzi: The Incredible True Story of the King of Financial Cons (Library of Larceny) &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Sarah Palin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Arg." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/PalinInDover-cropped2.JPG/250px-PalinInDover-cropped2.JPG" alt="" width="250" height="252"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made rape victims pay for their own &lt;a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/us_politics/view.bg?articleid=1118416&amp;amp;srvc=2008campaign&amp;amp;position=5"&gt;forensic investigation kits&lt;/a&gt;, and if a 14-year old rape victim is impregnated by the encounter, she’d prefer the government &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/01/palin-on-abortion-id-oppo_n_122924.html"&gt;force the girl to have the baby&lt;/a&gt;. She’s a young-Earth &lt;a href="http://www.adn.com/sarah-palin/background/story/217111.html"&gt;creationist&lt;/a&gt; who thinks that schools should teach kids that “Goddidit” is a good alternative for evolutionary theory. She thinks &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/sep/28/nation/na-palinreligion28"&gt;men and dinosaurs co-existed&lt;/a&gt;. She doesn’t believe in man-made global climate change. She wants the Constitution to &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/20/politics/fromtheroad/entry4531945.shtml"&gt;ban same-sex marriage&lt;/a&gt;. She did &lt;a href="http://www.grizzlybay.org/SarahPalinInfoPage.htm"&gt;a lot more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was seriously in contention for Vice President of the United States and considered by some to be a strong feminist symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img title="Douche" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Jenny_McCarthy_at_E3_2006.jpg/200px-Jenny_McCarthy_at_E3_2006.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="261"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly gave her first place. After all, few other people have done as much to put the lives of others at risk through the spreading of misinformation, and few others have shown themselves to be bigger clowns than Jenny. (Our #2 and #1 choices, respectively, have accomplished these goals.) Jenny spent her year convincing otherwise logical people that doctors are out to kill their children through vaccines, which is akin to suggesting that CPR was invented by succubi who secretly want to steal your soul through your mouth. She enjoyed broadcasting lies that have been repeatedly debunked, again and again. Our friend Orac has pretty much turned his blog &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/"&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; into a full-time JennyWatch, and a new site called &lt;a href="http://www.stopjenny.com"&gt;Stop Jenny&lt;/a&gt; started specifically to catalog the reasons why she is wrong in just about every word that comes out of her mouth. For instance: she thinks there are no autistic adults, because these vaccines weren’t around 40 years ago. No, Jenny: there are no autistic adults because you’re living in a fantasy world where there are no autistic adults, as opposed to the real world where there are, unfortunately, &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/2006/03/one-point-five.html"&gt;plenty of them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;George W. Bush&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://img257.imageshack.us/img257/6894/bush460mg1.jpg" alt="W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight years of lies, half-truths, and misleading half-literate ramblings – what could I possibly say that hasn’t been said a hundred times over? Oh, I know, this: one of his last major acts before leaving office was expanding Health &amp;amp; Human Services regulations that allow health workers such as pharmacists to restrict women’s access to birth control due to “religious reasons.” &lt;a href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/bush_administration_embraces_anti_contraception_agenda/"&gt;Awesome feminist Amanda Marcotte&lt;/a&gt; writes about how he also opened up Title X family planning funding to organizations that refuse to educate newly pregnant women on all their options (including, of course, abortion). Thanks, Bush! It’s so nice to have something to remember you by. Like an unwanted baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.  &lt;strong&gt;Ben Stein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3284/2965022152_d4ed2e4a4b_m.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben wins our number one spot not because he caused the most damage. On the contrary, he wins because he drew the most attention to himself, and then made the biggest ass of himself as was possible. The nearest equivalent would be your drunk, shirtless cousin climbing to the second story balcony and shouting “Hey y’all, look et me!” before tripping over the ledge and tumbling into a pig sty full of manure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quick recap of Ben’s jackassery: first he starred in &lt;a href="http://www.expelledexposed.com/"&gt;Expelled&lt;/a&gt;: No Intelligence Allowed, a documentary that lived up to its name by being the stupidest feature to hit the big screen since Paulie Shore was relevant. Which, oddly, was the last time Ben Stein was relevant. Weren’t they both in Biodome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the idiocy of the movie is difficult to summarize in one short blog post, since Ben’s ultimate point in Expelled is that Darwin personally green-lit the Holocaust. On the circuit when Ben was shilling for his crapumentary, he specifically said &lt;a href="http://boingboing.net/2008/05/01/ben-stein-science-le.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [biologist P.Z. Myers], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed … that was horrifying beyond words, and that’s where science — in my opinion, this is just an opinion — that’s where science leads you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, Ben. The last time any of your relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were probably having their fucking lives saved with bypass surgery or maybe they were buckling their seat belts thanks to studies showing it keeps you safer or maybe they were wearing eyeglasses invented by a scientist, improved by a scientist, and prescribed by a scientist. Dickhole quotes like the above make me want to stab Ben Stein. WITH SCIENCE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Expelled bombed in the theater and earned a golden 3.7 of 10 on &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091617/"&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt; and 10% on the &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/expelled_no_intelligence_allowed/"&gt;Tomatometer&lt;/a&gt;, worse than &lt;em&gt;Blair Witch 2&lt;/em&gt; (13%), &lt;em&gt;The Dukes of Hazzard&lt;/em&gt; (14%), and &lt;em&gt;Cat in the Hat&lt;/em&gt; (12%). It was panned by pretty much everybody, everywhere, most recently &lt;a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/win_ben_steins_mind.html"&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/a&gt;. Ben Stein is, once again, a joke, and his sad little movie will be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, that’s it! Who did I forget?

I’ve continued to consult with lawyers on their criminal and civil law cases and I still write articles and books, but I’ve found that I rather miss my daily contact with students. So, in an effort to keep some kind of contact alive, I set up my website in such a way that if people who want access to some of my papers on it, they first have to email me and tell me something about themselves and why they want access to this material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the information they give me is minimal, I usually give them my password anyway. We often have two or three email exchanges about their questions, but most of the time I never hear from them again. Once in a while I actually get an opportunity to teach that is more than simply giving them access to my published papers. One example of this bears some amplification. Here’s the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a year ago, a 37 year-old linguistics student in Iran wrote me for some help with her master’s thesis on a forensic linguistics topic and we had a series of email exchanges that she claims were very helpful. Her English was minimal, but I could usually figure out what she meant. It didn’t take long to discover that I was helping with her English as much as with her thesis topic. She eventually completed her thesis and in the process greatly improved her ability to write in English, well enough in fact to cause her department chair to ask her to teach English courses to students at her university,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She accepted the job and now our almost daily email exchanges have turned to the problems she’s having with the beginning English textbook that she’s using. I don’t know what that textbook is, but it is full of samples of American English, including tape-recorded examples. Her emails, among other things, concern American culture, pop icons, celebrations, holidays, and scads of “how do you pronounce this?” questions. Many questions are about grammar and usage issues that most native speakers take for granted without even thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve greatly enjoyed my new after-the-classroom classroom role and I wonder why other people, retired linguists in particular, don’t do the same thing. If you can find a struggling scholar in another country, especially one who has only limited access to current scholarship, you can become a tutor by email. I certainly recommend it, both for the overseas learner and for the long-distance tutors like me. I suppose it helps to be a linguist, because language specialists can give the most up to date information and the reasons why certain language features work the way they do. As a side benefit, we can always hope that we might offer some subtle improvements in international cooperation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe such language learning collaboration is commoner than I suspected. For example, Atsuki Kobayashi runs a &lt;a href="http://lang-8.com"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, where users can write journal entries in the language that they are learning, and then get responses and corrections from a respondent who is a native speaker of that language. I know very little about it but the website says that this also works two ways, when both users are learning each other’s language.&lt;/p&gt;

Enter &lt;a href="http://massify.com/"&gt;massify.com&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the film industry equivalent of a thirsty baby playing with an open bottle of Drano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently they crowd-sourced an entire movie. Everything from the script to the casting was voted on, presumably by the same lunkheads who turned Digg into an extension of Apple marketing interspersed with unfunny comics and left-wing commentary. It’s a process scientifically designed to produce a film that’s mediocre for its budget range, which apparently was somewhere in between what a student film normally costs and my monthly car insurance payment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing good can come of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trailer can be found &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P-2rXS5LS4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but if you don’t feel like watching, let me sum it up. It’s every other low-budget slasher film trailer you’ve ever seen, but more low-budgety. Lots of short, blood-soaked clips fading out of and into blackness, some roars and creaky fence sounds. But in this case they couldn’t even afford the narrator with the really deep voice that everyone else uses, so they just show some words, because if there’s one thing we know slasher film fans love, it’s reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it’s neat the way the process worked, but I guess I’m unable to see the value in coming up with a novel way to produce more cinematic detritus. Hollywood regurgitates this crap 10 times a year, except (judging from the trailer) with more polish. They don’t need crowd sourcing to add to the dung heap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that this gives a lot of people outside of the film industry a chance to participate, but I’m not so sure that is a good thing. The industry is sufficiently easy to at least attempt to join that anyone not motivated enough to try doesn’t belong on the set or in the production credits. Letting a gas station employee play director is perhaps less dangerous than letting him be a thoracic surgeon, but it’s no more likely to achieve a good result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood isn’t incapable of good movies or new ideas, though you’d be forgiven for thinking that if you walked by a theater today. There’s an entire independent film system out there working very hard at making actual art. Lots of unknown people from a gas station in Whereversville end up getting their movie produced that way (or even through the major studios occasionally) every year because they send in something good. Not every movie is written by a John August or a Josh Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the one thing the movie industry has going for it is that it’s still much more meritocratic than most of the rest of America. A good script is a good script, no matter who wrote it, and the same is true of acting and directing. If a gas station attendant is still years away from breaking through, there’s a good reason for that. The system is flawed and imperfect, and probably ripe for change, but it still functions at a level where if anyone is so good that they can’t be ignored, they’ll end up on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the process is definitely new, I’m just not sure that making a movie via the crowd is a good idea if more of the same crap that’s been destroying the industry that some of us still love for the last 20 years is the result. Perhaps I’m just a curmudgeon clinging to some silly notion of the movie as America’s greatest art form, but this looks like something that nothing good can ever come of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm referring to so-called "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/03/woo_invades_the_military.php"&gt;battlefield acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;," a topic that I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/woo_in_the_military_acupuncture.php"&gt;wrote about last week&lt;/a&gt; for this very blog. I didn't think there'd be a reason to revisit the subject again so soon, but I was wrong for three reasons. First, I remain appalled at how one ideologue, &lt;a href="http://www.n5ev.com/"&gt;Col. (Dr.) Richard Niemtzow&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist and Air Force physician turned woo-meister-in-chief and number one advocate of acupuncture use in the military, has succeeded in introducing acupuncture into not only formerly hard-nosed and science-based military hospitals like Walter Reed Army Medical Center and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (the latter of which is, by the way, the first stop outside of the Middle East for our wounded soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan), but has even started to train U.S. Army Rangers in the technique. Before I had heard the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/woo_in_the_military_acupuncture.php"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago, I had thought the term "battlefield acupuncture" was a misnomer because it wasn't actually being used on the battlefield, but rather for phantom limb pain and other acute and chronic pain conditions in military hospitals. Unfortunately, this latter development shows just how far Col. Niemtzow wishes to go with this "technique." Second, Col. Niemtzow's acupuncture technique isn't even "real" acupuncture. He calls it "auricular acupuncture," and it involves sticking needles a measly 1 mm into the earlobe. (How he accurately measures 1 mm, who knows?) Worse, he justifies this technique through ignorance of anatomy, &lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation/bal-te.pain11dec11,0,3574554.story?track=rss"&gt;claiming that&lt;/a&gt; "the ear acts as a 'monitor' of signals passing from body sensors to the brain" and that "those signals can be intercepted and manipulated to stop pain or for other purposes." He even made a comment about 18th century pirates wearing a lot of earrings in order to improve their night vision. I kid you not; it's a hunk o' hunk o' burnin' stupid. Third, and finally, Col. Niemtzow has published another one of his "studies" to support the use of acupuncture in chronic pain syndromes among our combat wounded veterans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/battlefield_acupuncture_revisited_only_t.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/battlefield_acupuncture_revisited_only_t.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/492383034" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229965769787"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3561">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0d5e3fa6bf96ba39</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="music"/><title type="html">The Latest in Recession Pop</title><published>2008-12-22T17:03:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T17:03:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/RS3btbGnTy4/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/the-latest-in-recession-pop/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">If things keep going as they are, Billboard is going to have to start a new Hot 100 chart just for songs about the Great Recession.

For me, this week of holiday celebrations carries with it a very special reminder, one that people all over the world should never forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 20, 1996, the world mourned the loss of one of the all time greatest champions of science and skepticism, &lt;a href="http://www.carlsagan.com/"&gt;Carl Sagan&lt;/a&gt;. For those that need a refresher, here is a quick &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JX_-jaJOrU"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; reminder from that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 21, 1996, I borrowed the Connecticut Skeptical Society’s copy of Sagan’s book, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World"&gt;The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;. If I had any lingering doubts that I was a skeptic, they evaporated over the course of the 10 days I took to carefully read that book. Prior to that, I had only seen bits and pieces of the Cosmos series, and one or two of his appearances on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_Starring_Johnny_Carson"&gt;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&lt;/a&gt;. I had never read Sagan, but only through reading his perfect treatise to skepticism did I realize how gigantic an intellect, scholar, and thinker we had just lost. If my skepticism prior to The Demon Haunted World was a lump of clay, Carl Sagan fired the kiln that solidified it. Here it is today, twelve years ago to that week. Of all of the writings that I have read in my twelve years as a practicing skeptic, there is still no single piece of writing that has had a greater impact on my critical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have come to read much more of Sagan, I have watched Cosmos from beginning to end several times, and I have watched several old interviews online. I regularly visit his website for updates, and this weekend, Ann Druyan (Carl’s widow) links to a very &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJqVG37z_NM&amp;amp;fmt=18"&gt;wonderful video just released by NASA&lt;/a&gt; promoting their September announcement of The Carl Sagan Exoplanet Fellowships. NASA has only two other named fellowships in astrophysics. Their names are Einstein and Hubble. As our friend Bill Nye ‘The Science Guy” says in the clip, this fellowship could not be more appropriately named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And frankly, this is just one layer of the strata that was Carl Sagan. His work in the sciences was beyond remarkable, but his enormous impact was also felt as a teacher, a television personality, a columnist, a lobbyist, a historian, a sports fanatic, a music enthusiast, a celebrity (arguably the most down to earth celebrity in the history of celebrities) – but most importantly, and unfortunately only recognized by a small percentage of the people of the world, Carl was a skeptic. This single quality permeated all of his other qualities, as it permeated everything in his cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as we all huddle into our little holiday bubbles this week and next, take a couple of minutes to read a chapter of your favorite Sagan book, or bounce around YouTube and listen to Dr. Sagan once again. If you have a young child, now is as good of a time as any to introduce Carl Sagan to them. I guarantee you will feel better than you did before hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good health and good cheer to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229954667995"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4866">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/429e473a112b90b9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 12.22</title><published>2008-12-22T14:00:32Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T14:00:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4866" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it. What is it that actors do? They read lines given to them. True, some have a talent that goes beyond that; they can actually write or direct. But few of them have any more abilities when it comes to science than the average populace. Indeed, arguably, they have less knowledge of science than average. Witness, for instance, Jenny McCarthy and her crusade against vaccines. Yes, I realize that she claims not to be "antivaccine," but her actions and words say otherwise. She's also managed to suck her boyfriend Jim Carrey into the morass of quackery and pseudoscience for which she has become the figurehead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that apparently Jim Carrey was &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20247586,00.html"&gt;more than receptive&lt;/a&gt; to McCarthy's charms other than her obvious ones:&lt;br&gt;

They are dedicated to some permutation of the collection of beliefs that vaccines are: 1) not effective; 2) have not reduced or eliminated any infectious disease; 3) are not safe; and 4) are a conspiracy of Big Pharma, the government, and paid-off doctors. Specific claims have wandered over the years, but they have as a central theme that vaccines are bad. When one specific claim collapses, they will move on to the next anti-vaccine claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine cranks have been around as long as vaccines, it is only recently that they have captured the attention of the mainstream media and the skeptical movement and the battle has really been engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-vaccinationists have focused much of their recent efforts on the claim that vaccines cause autism. At first the MMR vaccine was blamed, sparked by a now-discredited study performed by Andrew Wakefield. This led to declining vaccination rates in the UK and a resurgence of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the MMR claim was in decline (although by no means abandoned), attention shifted to thimerosal - a mercury-based preservative in some vaccines. There are many flaws with the thimerosal hypothesis, and numerous studies have shown no link between thimerosal and autism or any neurological disorder. But the fatal blow to the thimerosal hypothesis was struck when thimerosal was removed from the routine childhood vaccine schedule (thimerosal, incidentally, was never in the MMR vaccine) in the US by 2002. In the subsequent 6 years the rate of autism diagnoses kept increasing at their previous rate, without even a blip. Only the most rabid (or scientifically illiterate)  anti-vaccine fanatics still cling to the thimerosal claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So attention has shifted yet again. Now the anti-vaccine crowd are hedging their bets with the “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=9"&gt;toxin gambit&lt;/a&gt;.” They blame various “toxins” in vaccines for its alleged and unproven side effects. Mercury is still on the list, but they have added aluminum, which is added to vaccines to make them more effective. They cite hydrochloric acid, which they don’t understand is added to balance the pH of vaccines. They try to scare people by saying vaccines contain formaldehyde, but neglect to mention that formaldehyde is already naturally present in our blood in higher amounts than are found in vaccines. They even make up some toxins (aided by their limitless scientific ignorance) by misreading chemical names. Jenny McCarthy, for example, has repeated numerous times (despite being called on it) the canard that vaccines contain ether and anti-freeze - both untrue. They also try the scare tactic of saying that vaccines contain viral proteins - uh, yeah, that’s the point. And that they may contain fetal tissue - which is a gross distortion. Some vaccine components were cultured in cells that were derived years ago from fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For a more thorough review of the science behind recent anti-vaccine claims you can browse through my &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?s=thimerosal"&gt;many blog posts&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, or read&lt;a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/2007-06/novella.html"&gt; this overview&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for the Skeptical Inquirer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Anti-Vaccine Players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active players on the anti-vaccine side include a number of organizations, such as Safe Minds and Age of Autism. They have been given an incredible boost by the internet, as the skeptical movement has, and have been tireless in spreading their misinformation and ideology on their websites and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wakefield, despite being discredited, has not recanted his claim that there is a link between MMR and vaccines. He now portrays himself as a martyr to the cause. As a doctor and researcher he remains an icon of the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other anti-vaccine researchers include the father and son team of &lt;a href="http://www.casewatch.org/civil/geier.shtml"&gt;Mark and David Geier&lt;/a&gt;. They have made a career publishing bogus studies claiming to show a statistical correlation between vaccine and autism. Their studies crumble under peer-review, however. They have also spent a lot of time as expert witnesses for attorneys suing over vaccine injury. Their worst contribution to anti-vaccine nonsense, in my opinion, is a recent study in which they are treating autistic children with Lupron and chelation therapy. They were only able to get approval for this ethically dubious study by putting together their own IRB board packed with cronies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=301"&gt;Dr. Jay Gordon&lt;/a&gt; is a “pediatrician to the stars” and prominent figure in the anti-vaccine pantheon, despite his coy and unconvincing protests that he is not anti-vaccine. He is notorious for relying upon his gut instinct as a clinician rather than actual published scientific evidence, and makes a slew of anti-vaccine claims that are completely unsupported by evidence. For example he is proponent of the notion that the childhood vaccine program gives too many vaccines too soon - without any scientific rationale or evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=JB+Handley+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;J.B. Handley&lt;/a&gt; is the co-founder of generation rescue, a parent-based autism support group that is dedicated to the notion that autism is a vaccine-injury. His group also favors and promotes a number of biological therapies for autism, such as chelation therapy, all based either on the mercury poisoning hypothesis, or any dubious alternative therapy that comes along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?s=David+Kirby"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt; is a journalist who gave the thimerosal hypothesis a huge boost with his 2006 book Evidence of Harm.  In it he puts forward the claim that there is a vast conspiracy among the pharmaceutical industry, the government (via the FDA and CDC) and the medical establishment to hide the evidence that thimerosal in vaccines causes autism. He has subsequently built his career around that book, and clings tenaciously to the thimerosal claim. He blogs for The Huffington Post, where he repeats his anti-vaccine propaganda on a regular basis. Kirby is most notorious for specifically claiming that autism rates should plummet following the removal of thimerosal from the vaccine schedule, and then subsequently &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=83"&gt;moving the goalpost&lt;/a&gt; on his prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer and environmentalist who has championed the hard-core conspiracy theories surrounding the anti-vaccine claims. He wrote &lt;a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7395411/deadly_immunity/"&gt;Deadly Immunity&lt;/a&gt; (published simultaneously Rolling Stone magazine and Salon.com), and followed up with a ridiculous screed called &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=58"&gt;Attack on Mothers&lt;/a&gt;. He has been particularly shrill and paranoid in his writings, and just as scientifically clueless. This was the primary reason for the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=414"&gt;controversy that erupted&lt;/a&gt; when his name was floated for an Obama appointment to head the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reigning superstar of the anti-vaccine movement is actress &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=390"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;.  After deciding that her son, Evan, was an indigo child (actually, she is an “indigo” and Evan is a “crystal” - divine manifestors here to save the earth, so they have that going for them) McCarthy later decided that Evan had autism caused by the MMR vaccine. So she shifted from crusading to spread the word of indigo children to the world to spreading anti-vaccine propaganda. She has subsequently been relentless in spreading her scientific illiteracy and fear mongering, and was the primary force behind the “Green or Vaccine” march earlier this year. She believes that we should listen to her “mommy instinct” rather than scientific evidence. Eager for a celebrity face to put on their movement, McCarthy was rapidly positioned as the de facto leader of the anti-vaccine crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her celebrity has indeed made her dangerous. She has also managed to rope in her boyfriend, &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=399"&gt;Jim Carrey&lt;/a&gt;, who is also as clueless as he is famous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also a huge player in the anti-vaccine movement is the media. In general the mainstream media have been mixed in the quality of their approach to this issue. Sometimes a mainstream outlet does a decent job, but mostly they allow Jenny McCarthy and her ilk to have a free ride, with perhaps lame token skepticism thrown in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beyond mainstream media incompetence, there are several outlets that have actively promoted the anti-vaccine movement, and they deserve a large share of the blame for the harm that results. This includes the Huffington Post, which I already mentioned as the blog home of David Kirby. Larry King has also allowed his show to be used to promote anti-vaccine pseudoscience. But the queen of shilling for dangerous quackery is Oprah Winfrey. She has the largest and most adoring audience. She has promoted Jenny McCarthy and Dr. Jay Gordon on her show numerous times. She doesn’t even bother with the token science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many others, but those are the names that have been prominent in the media recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of players opposing the anti-vaccine movement is not as long.  The most prominent opponent is &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=173"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and researcher who recently published a book on the topic called Autism’s False Prophets. He has endured personal threats in order to tirelessly attack the pseudoscience of the anti-vaccine crowd. He is certainly their enemy #1. He understands the issue inside and out and is an effective public speaker and writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently actress &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=350"&gt;Amanda Peet&lt;/a&gt; decided to go up against Jenny McCarthy in a celebrity death match over the issue (or at least that’s how the media likes to play it). She has become a spokesperson for the vaccine program, and has specifically targeted anti-vaccine propaganda. She also has made an effective swipe at McCarthy exploiting her celebrity to promote her own wacky ideas. Peet stresses that she is not an expert, and that she defers to the scientific consensus on vaccines. She is not trying to substitute her own opinion for that of experts, she is simply trying to get the word out that vaccines are a safe and effective public health measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those who have been in the trenches countering anti-vaccine propaganda at every turn are skeptics and science bloggers. I have been writing about the issue since 2005, and in fact have been engaged directly by David Kirby and others. David Gorski, who blogs for Science-Based Medicine and Respectful Insolence, has also been blogging very effectively on this issue for years. Dr. Gordon, in fact, treats him as his personal nemesis. Our allies across the pond include Ben Goldacre who write the Bad Science column. Even non-physician skeptical bloggers will occasionally take on anti-vaccine nuttery. Phil Plait, for example, will take time away from astronomy to dismantle the latest anti-vaccine pseudoscience. There are others, and my apologies to anyone I did not specifically mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bloggers in the autism community, like the &lt;a href="http://autismdiva.blogspot.com/"&gt;autism diva&lt;/a&gt;,  have also opposed the anti-vaccine crowd, partly because in order to bolster their fear mongering the anti-vaccinationists have portrayed autism as a universally “life sucking”disorder. It is not hard to understand why some autism parents would be offended at that characterization of their children, or why they would resent the use of autism to fear-monger about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government and mainstream medical community has been largely ineffective on the issue. They try, with occasional official statements about the science, but they simply don’t have the experience dealing with a dedicated pseudoscientific popular movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Stakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this particular battle are quite high.  Obviously, everyone wants effective vaccine regulation and safety monitoring. There is broad support for the vaccine compensation program, that streamlines the process of financially compensating children and families that have suffered legitimate side effects from vaccines. On any particular claim, we want the scientific chips to fall where they may. If some vaccine ingredient is causing harm, we need to find out right away and make the necessary changes. Only a cartoonish, handlebar mustache-twisting villain would want to allow children to be harmed through compulsory vaccines. Anti-vaccine hysteria, however, hampers effective vaccine safety by diverting attention and resources to false claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most direct consequence of the anti-vaccine movement, and their recent successes with Jenny McCarthy and Oprah, is stoking public fears about the vaccine program leading to declining vaccination rates. This has already resulted in increased outbreaks of &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=363"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=365"&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt;.  Vaccine hysteria in Nigeria set back the goal of eradicating polio from the world for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having ones’ children vaccinated does not only put your children at risk but others as well. As vaccination rates drop, infectious diseases they would normally prevent are allowed to spread through the population. This puts everyone at risk, but especially those people who cannot be vaccinated because of a medical contraindication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine crowd has also opposed attempts to shield vaccine manufacturers from liability. No one is arguing that vaccine producers get a free pass - they are still responsible for their product, and are certainly tightly regulated by the government. However, if they were vulnerable every lawyer trying to make a buck off of anti-vaccine pseudoscience, it would quickly become impossible to produce vaccines. It would not be worth it for any company to sell vaccines - and of course that is the goal of the anti-vaccine movement. They want to end vaccines, and harassing lawsuits are just one method. This is partly why the government set up the vaccine compensation program - there is a small tax attached to every vaccine, and that tax goes into a pool that is then paid out to those injured by vaccines, as determined by a federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up another risk of the anti-vaccine movement. There are now about 5,000 cases before the vaccine injury compensation program by parents who allege that their children’s autism was caused by vaccines. The courts now have to spend time and taxpayer money legally settling a question that the scientific community already has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-vaccine movement is a recent skeptical battleground, and one that is still very active.  This is certainly one of the biggest issues from 2008, and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Skeptics have been particularly effective in dissecting the claims of the anti-vaccinationists and pointing out the dangers of anti-vaccine hysteria. But the anti-vaccinationists have the momentum, due largely to Jenny McCarthy and Oprah Winfrey. Vaccine rates are declining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as if we may be seeing a momentum shift, however. Next year will be very telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is clear - the skeptical movement has to keep vigilant and keep the pressure on. We have to oppose anti-vaccine pseudoscience at every turn. We need to make ourselves available to the mainstream media and be effective at the public relations end of the game. We need to get the mainstream scientific and medical communities more active and show them how it’s done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fight we can win, and I think we are making headway.&lt;/p&gt;

In this list, I identify the positives and negatives of each book in brief reviews. Books #4-#1 will be discussed in later posts. Enjoy! &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since I began my in-depth study, I've read a few dozen books, but in the eight months since I started I certainly haven't even started chipping the iceberg of all that's out there. Many people will notice some important authors missing from this list, but it is more likely that I simply haven't read them yet (Habermas, Swinburne, Quentin Smith, Flew, etc., are a few that come immediately to mind). A few other key works from recognized authors (Dawkins, Hitchens, C.S. Lewis, Strobel) were either good but not great enough for the list, or were simply not good enough for any list at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. "Why I Am Not a Christian," by Bertrand Russell - the "Mere Christianity" of atheism from the "C.S. Lewis" of nonbelief, this work marked the popular start of the nontheistic point of view. Now old, outdated, and (especially in its chapters on morality) somewhat polemical and even downright mean, there's still a reason those worn-down arguments against theism and Christianity survive today - like Lewis, Bertrand Russell became the godfather of a particular modern way of viewing religion and its implications for mankind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9. "Some Mistakes of Moses," by Robert Ingersoll - a work based more on sarcasm than theology, Bob Ingersoll, who was the Hitchens of his day back in the late nineteenth century, explores the first five books of the Bible with a wit that bites with teeth even sharper than Bob's aforementioned contemporary counterpart. As one of the top showmen in the long-dead but once-popular art of oration, such creative wording often overrode the need for deeper consideration. Nonetheless, a good read on a rainy day for the skeptic looking to beef up his writing style a bit, or for an apologist to entertain the more emotional aspects of criticism of the Christian faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. "I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist," by Turek and Geisler - The best comprehensive volume on Christian arguments I have seen, this book nonetheless suffers from a patchwork feel, as if e.g. Craig (ch. 8's style) has been sewn to Habermas (ch. 11), glued to McDowell (ch. 9), grated with a touch of Lacona (ch. 12), and topped with the most popular faulty theistic argument that Norm and Frank actually fix to make effective and valid enough to consider heavily - the "Trilemma" (now with Geisler's rewrite, the Quadlemma?) (ch. 13). The result is a sense of disconnectedness, especially at first, where the SURGE notion is thrust upon us so quickly that one wonders whether one misunderstood what they had written or whether the writers themselves could have spent more work on it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A somewhat Hitchensesque forward is followed by an introductory section on the secular point of view and on basic philosophy, but the book's subsequent method - which leans on arguments *for* God while seemingly accepting a couple of potshots at atheists in embarrassing moments for arguments directly supporting their book's title *against* atheism - tends to be disjointed when taken as a whole. Craig's book, although less accessible to the laymen in its style, has a much greater power and cohesiveness. Nonetheless, this book really engaged me on my first readthrough, and opened me up to theistic presentations I had not yet considered. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7) "The Apologetics Bible," Various. A hodgepodge of Christian thinkers comment on the entire Bible with the shared goal of the apologetic defense of the general Christian faith. The result is the Bible I do my semi-daily studies from (yes, I do Bible study, and no, most of the time I don't even do it with the presumption of squashing whatever verse I want to read). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some difficult verses are especially analyzed, with accompanying exegesis so long that neighboring important verses are at times ignored, but the work is thought-provoking and worthy of further research. Articles on every topic of Christian difficulties imaginable are included as well, and many of them serve as a good starting point for the thinking skeptic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The commentaries ultimately suffer from a very obvious internal tiff between the Calvinists, Arminians, Molinists, etc., etc., etc. who worked on their variously assigned verses. These conflicts were made pretty explicit by the addition of the "for another perspective on this verse go to page ..." type references below an exegesis of a difficult verse obviously representing a definitive take on a controversial view (e.g. the commentaries on Romans 9). I find it strange that with so many internally different theological viewpoints allowed in the commentary, no Catholic to my knowledge was invited to give his own thoughts, and the fundamentalist Protestant Church of Christ denomination is bashed in a "Twisted Scripture" aside. At any rate, the Apologetics Bible is, in my opinion, the best single Bible for apologists and skeptics alike to cross-check their interpretations of specific verses and passages. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. "Godless" by Dan Barker - Mostly elevated on this list due to better argumentation than his previous book and in comparison to other more popular recent works not from a religious perspective, Barker's book blends Biblical analysis with politics and, like John, a sprinkle of Danny's "downfall story" in the cracks between. The better chapters making strides toward Kalam and the Resurrection claims overshadow his comparitively weak Christ Myth section, light treatment of other arguments e.g. the Moral Argument, and rehashes from his first book of long-refuted cases like his Bible contradictions, which have, with little exception, been dispensed by apologists since the times where we worried about phone calls cutting off our AOL connection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a smart man with a theological background, I would like to see Dan Barker spend some more time on the core arguments; John trumps the FFRF president in the research category. However, this does not take away from Dan's more relevant thrusts, so despite some flaws I still recommend and endorse this book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. "End of Faith," Sam Harris - presenting a moral case that contains a humanistic foundation, Harris not only paves the way toward the goal of logically verifiable morality, but also uses that foundation to justify his moral judgment on religion. This is what makes him the best of the Four Horsemen - he actually attempts a metaphysical basis for morality so that he can have a podium on which to present his arguments. Harris hits near where it counts, and is the first nontheist from the United States with a powerful name who critiques Islam with even more gusto than Christianity, regardless of the resultant intolerance from the preachy tolerant Far Left. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the total lack of deep Biblical/Koran analysis in End of Faith shows, and as his rather poor and emotional exegesis in the followup "Letter to a Christian Nation" furthers, Harris unfortunately misses the central theme of faith - the critical analysis of claimed religious revelation in the texts of their God(s). Harris also ends a mostly solid book with a Zenish feel - a supposed thought experiment in which one realizes that one's consciousness is not, in fact, conscious (!!). He then gives the nod to Eastern religions for reasons his book fails to make clear at all; what does Eastern faith have to do with an atheistic worldview or a case against religious extremism? At least the rest of the work is significant enough to cover this tail-end oddness, although I personally still disagree with him that moderates enable extremists in all cases. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rest of my list, including DC's lead writer and my friend John Loftus' work, will be analyzed in further detail and posted as much as I am able to do during the upcoming busy holiday period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

As their &lt;a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/about/"&gt;About the NAS page&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Academies perform an unparalleled public service by bringing together committees of experts in all areas of scientific and technological endeavor. These experts serve pro bono to address critical national issues and give advice to the federal government and the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by the NAS asking if I would post about &lt;a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/85927/what-matters-most-to-you-c"&gt;a survey they are hosting about the public’s concerns over science&lt;/a&gt;. This survey will literally take you about one minute to take, and will help guide them in creating educational materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a little concerned over the topics they created; many are very general and will need significant honing once they’re narrowed down by the survey. Perhaps they’ll host another when this one is completed. Anyway, please take a moment to fill it out; the deadline is January 16.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229920904208"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/872020800ccd280e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Reindeer Games</title><published>2008-12-22T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/santa/reindeer.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Are all the reindeer who pull Santa's sleigh actually female?</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229920573383"><id gr:original-id="http://www.apathysketchpad.com/blog/?p=960">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0462d81deeaf9964</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">A Sub-Molecular Dilution of Credibility</title><published>2008-12-22T02:44:23Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T02:44:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.apathysketchpad.com/blog/2008/12/22/a-sub-molecular-dilution-of-credibility/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">A couple of hours ago, the anonymous quack who calls herself homeopathy4health posted an article entitled “James Randi avoids homeopathic challenge for $1 million prize” and, in true cowardly fashion, immediately disabled user comments.

Its essence is an asseveration that the physical constants must have values within extremely narrow limits in order for life to exist. Since the constants indeed have such values as is necessary for life existence, those values, according to creationists, point to the intelligent design of the universe. Many counter-arguments have been suggested refuting the “fine-tuning” argument.  Mathematician Mark Frank suggests one more counter-argument from an angle somehow differing from those suggested hitherto.

I know we did. Will they cover us? Are we ready for the exposure yet? Can our server handle the traffic? We had the first one covered since we were part of Y Combinator, but the rest were concerns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants that TechCrunch bump, and wants it to go smoothly, but what nobody told us was all of the crap that happens as a result of the coverage. I don’t blame any of it on TechCrunch, it’s just a side-effect of their success. Once you get listed on their site, if you have contact information available you’re bombarded by a stream of annoying bullshit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst was a Dell salesman. I think his name was Matthew Lamm. He emailed pitching hardware, which would have been fine if that were the end of it. We weren’t interested in buying their stuff and told them so. Then he put me on some sort of list, to which he sent out every out of office notification. Every time there was a holiday I got email notifications about his being away. A salesman I don’t know whose product I was not interested in buying was telling me he was away for Christmas. It was just frequent enough to annoy me, but not quite enough for me to take time out of a busy day to filter them out. Worse yet, I finally sent him a terse email, got off the list, only to wind up back on it when he left Dell and a new salesman took over his accounts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As annoying as that was, though, at least he had some sort of email software that sent them all individually. A few of the CrunchLeeches (what I call them since they feed off of the blood of startups covered) just send out one giant email with everyone CC’ed, meaning that everyone who replies is emailing you too. Limelight Networks is the most recent offender. (I’ve had this problem with RockYou too but not due to TechCrunch.) Just this week I got a Season’s Greetings from Limelight, which I think is a CDN (way to pitch static file hosting services to a fantasy sports startup there buddy) and surely enough in came the replies. I am willing to sell the list of a few dozen emails found therein to any competitor who wants them. It’s not very nice, but then neither is Limelight blasting my email to a bunch of people I don’t know or care about, and adding more garbage to the giant pile of emails that greets me every afternoon when I wake up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the slightly less odious but many times more voluminous headhunters. Every single one in the entire country at this point has cold-emailed me to tell me about a candidate they have who would be great for us. Of course, we use Ruby on Rails and Flash, while all of the candidates are .Net or Java guys. I suppose Rails and Flash devs are too in-demand at the moment to waste time with headhunters, but still, it would be nice if they at least tried to match up technologies, rather than just spamming me every programmer they get who likes sports. Or, you know, didn’t bother me at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which is not to say that it’s not worth being on TechCrunch. It is, especially if you’re the right kind of startup. It’s just that your junk folder is going to be bursting afterward.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Twice. And yet, somehow, I missed that this preschool was at a Lutheran church. Because of this, I withdraw my comment. When you put your kid in a religious place, then you have to expect they’ll get religion during the day unless otherwise told it won’t be so.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Laurie obviously has a problem with this. However, it’s not a public school, so it’s not technically illegal. She’s unsure what to do, and is asking for ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted my own idea in her comments (I was first. I’m &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; first. That was cool). Why not go over there and check out the details, and leave her a thoughtful reply?

Between 11am and 1pm today, you were supposed to have an orgasm to “effect positive change in the energy field of the earth.”&lt;br&gt;
So, if you didn’t do your part at the proper time, I suggest you get on it &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s safe to say that Skepchick readers will recognize what they call the “Science” of Orgasm Day as complete hokum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Global Consciousness Project, located in Princeton, New Jersey, runs a network of Random Event Generators around the world which record changes in their randomness during global events….Concentrated consciousness has measurable effects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our minds influence Matter and Quantum Energy fields, so by concentrating our thoughts during and after The Big O on peace and partnership, the combination of high orgasmic energy combined with mindful intention for peace could reduce global levels of violence, hatred and fear.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure  that the words “Quantum Energy Field” made your BS detection antennae quiver like mine.  Eh, it’s a good excuse to make out, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

In the article was this sentence:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoppers seem inured to the relentless Christmas spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left"&gt;From this I’d guess that most readers understand that shoppers are accustomed to and even accept this relentless Christmas spirit and that it’s not a good thing– except perhaps for the retail trades. &lt;em&gt;Inure, &lt;/em&gt;that is, conveys something negative here. Hold that thought while I describe a very different use of &lt;em&gt;inure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been helping the Montana Department of Revenue revise the thousand or so letters the tax people mail to taxpayers. It’s been an interesting experience, about which I intend to post more at some other time. But for now, let me cite the following sentence that appears in a number of letters sent to corporations about their tax status:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No part of the net income of a Montana tax-exempt organization can inure to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we see two somewhat dissimilar meanings of &lt;em&gt;inure &lt;/em&gt;(both are given in MWCD, by the way). &lt;em&gt;Inure&lt;/em&gt; conveys something bad when shoppers are inured to the relentless Christmas spirit. On the other hand, to the tax people inure can convey an advantage or benefit that stockholders or individuals might get in their business lives. But this positive advantage for these stockholders can also be judged to be bad (not legal by Montana law), making this good thing a non-acceptable bad thing, at least in the context of corporate taxation.  Are we confused yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I challenged the use of &lt;em&gt;inure&lt;/em&gt; in this letter, but the lawyers in the tax department strongly objected. I argued that these tax letters are replacing a word with one meaning that lay people know with a word that has another meaning known only to lawyers (probably) and accountants (possibly). But the lawyers informed me that &lt;em&gt;inure&lt;/em&gt; is one of those magical words that is absolutely necessary for legal reasons. Still, it seemed to me that it would be clearer to readers, even corporate readers, if the letter would say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No part of the net income of a Montana tax-exempt&lt;br&gt;
organization can financially benefit any private stockholder or&lt;br&gt;
individual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my thinking anyway, if we would replace “can inure to the benefit of” with the simpler, “can financially benefit,” the letter would covey the same thing and avoid the possibility of confusing readers with the apparent dual meanings (one positive and one negative) of &lt;em&gt;inure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t win this battle. The lawyers prevailed as they usually do and &lt;em&gt;inure &lt;/em&gt;remains in the letters. But am reminded of how confusing it can be to have one word with two or more fairly different meanings, like &lt;em&gt;sanction&lt;/em&gt;, for example, which is used to mean both “to agree” and “to criticize or condemn.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe corporations aren’t confused by this use of &lt;em&gt;inure&lt;/em&gt;, but I’ll bet a whole lot of people are.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229877155461"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/21/waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnt/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/985879475ec129d6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><category term="SciFi"/><title type="html">Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnt!!!!</title><published>2008-12-21T16:26:02Z</published><updated>2008-12-21T16:26:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/21/waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnt/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, now you know what to get me for Newtonmas.&lt;/p&gt;

Handley on &lt;em&gt;Larry King Live!&lt;/em&gt; originally scheduled for last night had nothing to do with me. Really. The cancellation was apparently announced shortly after my post appeared, leaving no time for it to have had an effect. Heck, for all I know the cancellation had occurred before I posted and I just hadn't noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the insinuations of dire conspiracies in the &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/larry-king-live-postponed-for-rerun.html#comment-6a00d8357f3f2969e2010536895370970b" rel="nofollow"&gt;comments of the Age of Autism post&lt;/a&gt; on the cancellation, it's far more likely that Larry King probably just didn't want to work on the Saturday before Christmas than that big pharma stretched out its dark arm and crushed this "threat" to its dominance. Of course, that Larry King substituted a rerun with that queen of breast cancer, "bioidentical hormone," and now stem cell woo, Suzanne Somers, strongly implies that no lesson has been learned. On the other hand, perhaps Somers' substitution for Jenny McCarthy is an unintentional admission that both are boosting equally bogus medical information and even outright quackery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, since the antivaccine side is no doubt deluging Larry King's guests e-mail with complaints and requests that McCarthy and Handley be rescheduled, I thought I should do my little part and request my readers to join in on the reality-based side and either (1) request that no guests pushing antivaccination nonsense and autism quackery be given a forum to promote their views; (2) that reality-based celebrities like Amanda Peet be invited instead; or (3) both.

Most of it is forgettable and repetitive — I&amp;#39;m usually accused of being against free speech, as if I had somehow barred the doors of that temple of foolishness in Kentucky, or had personally gagged Ken Ham — but this one stands out for it&amp;#39;s opening insult.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Myers,
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I understand that you are creationist - that loves God and real authentic science....right!
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since you so love to spend your time tearing others down (&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;like a coward - that can't handle an open and honest discussion&lt;/span&gt;) - so you can exult yourself as God.   I am sure God has a special plan in store for you.  You can&amp;#39;t ignore the truth Mr. Myers &amp;amp; most people are not fooling enough to take your DOGMA as &amp;quot;gospel&amp;quot;.  You are following right after the Devil himself.  I can&amp;#39;t believe that you are so AFRAID to allow others to hear an open and honest debate. 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your type of thinking is exactly the stuff that &lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;Adolf Hitler&lt;/span&gt; is made of.  I hope that end up in better place than him - because he is going to be burning in Hell forever, and ever, and ever.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
BTW -- Don't be surprised if you have a lot of challenges ahead of you.  You are messing with the Lord God Almighty.

Foderaro and Marc Santora, "&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/education/21newschool.html"&gt;To New School Critics, Their Leader Lacks Focus&lt;/a&gt;", NYT,  12/21/2008):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Even a 2005 campaign intended to help integrate what one professor called academic “silos” fell flat with names that made clear the programs were part of a larger whole but were tortuous to say: Parsons the New School for Design; Eugene Lang College the New School for Liberal Arts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The institutions in question used to be known as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_School_of_Design"&gt;Parsons School of Design&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Lang_College"&gt;Eugene Lang College&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. Although the new names are certainly longer,  they&amp;#39;re not exactly tongue twisters — if they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;tortuous to say&amp;quot;, it must be because of their unusual syntax. (And of course the names of such institutions are always in practice reduced to a syllable or two, in this case &amp;quot;Parsons&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Lang&amp;quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to wonder whether the article&amp;#39;s assertion about these names is true. (I know that I shouldn&amp;#39;t be in doubt about such a basic matter of fact in a New York Times article, but …) A quick glance at the New School&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.newschool.edu/"&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; reassures me. The banner at the top of the page features this text, suggesting that the current authorities at The New School are comfortable with names of the form &amp;quot;X &amp;lt;determiner&amp;gt; Y&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TNS1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among of the eight divisions listed on the upper left of the front page, two are single-word proper names ("Milano", "Parsons") followed by  appositive definite descriptions ("The New School for Management and Urban Policy", "The New School for Design"), while two are anarthrous college names followed by similar appositives ("Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts", "Mannes College The New School for Music"):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TNS2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the institution's &lt;a href="http://www.newschool.edu/news/index.aspx"&gt;News page&lt;/a&gt; includes headers like this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TNS3.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/TNS3.png" alt="" width="475"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that the facts are clear, let's go on to the syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Names of the form "X the Y" are common when X and Y are short: Henry the Eighth, Jack the Ripper, &lt;a href="http://www.jimthewonderdog.com/"&gt;Jim The Wonder Dog&lt;/a&gt;. But with longer names, especially of institutional parts of a whole, it's rare to juxtapose a name and a definite description in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commoner methods are to add the parent institution as initial modifier ("&lt;a href="http://annenberg.usc.edu/"&gt;USC Annenberg School for Communication&lt;/a&gt;") or a trailing prepositional phrase ("&lt;a href="http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/"&gt;The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;"), while some institutions don't bother trying to integrate the parent institution into their name at all (e.g. "&lt;a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/"&gt;Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs&lt;/a&gt;").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because The New School's name includes the word "school", these methods would also be awkward: &lt;em&gt;X Parsons School of Design&lt;/em&gt; would turn into "The New School Parsons School of Design"; and &lt;em&gt;Parsons School of Design of X&lt;/em&gt; would be "Parsons School of Design of The New School". The option chosen in 2005, "Parsons The New School for Design", might be even more awkward, but it's a close race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Parsons The New School for Design" strikes me as having a 17th-century flavor, but my attempts to validate this impression with book titles have failed so far, because the first few that I looked up had internal punctuation and/or syntactic articulation:&lt;/p&gt;

Excerpts, notes, and other information can be viewed &lt;a href="http://www.thereligiouscondition.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. So what’s the book about, and should you purchase it?&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first half of the book is on how persuasive psychology has demonstrated that certain factors have a much greater impact on the formation and maintenance of beliefs than they should, especially when those beliefs are unfalsifiable religious ones. Topics in this section include dissonance, confirmation bias, indoctrination, emotion, rationalization, and freethought. Key texts cited include Robert Cialdini’s &lt;i&gt;Influence&lt;/i&gt;, Richard Petty and John Cacioppo’s &lt;i&gt;Attitudes and Persuasion&lt;/i&gt;, and Michael Shermer’s &lt;i&gt;Why People Believe Weird Things&lt;/i&gt;. The second half of the book is my answer to negative responses on my previous work, focusing primarily on arguments related to evolution, creationism, proofs, argumentation, and morality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re interested in how psychological studies demonstrate that the majority of human beings are way too gullible and unreasonable to form objective conclusions on important matters (such as religion), and you’ve never read about the formation and maintenance of beliefs in depth, I think you would gain a lot from it. On the other hand, there would be nothing new to a freethinking persuasive psychologist here (“freethinking” would be a bit redundant, since I’ve never found a religious one). The balance of the book probably doesn’t provide too much new material for those who have read Sagan, Mills, Dawkins, Harris, etc., but it could serve as an inclusive summary refutation for those who haven’t. This portion is more of a fun project in the tradition of Sam Harris’ &lt;i&gt;Letter to a Christian Nation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So purchase it if you want, but I would also highly recommend reading all of the books I mentioned here in their entirety sooner or later. If you’re looking for an in depth scholarly discussion of apologetic views, by all means, read John’s book, not mine. His terrific work points out specifically why apologists are incorrect; mine points out why they’re unreliable to begin with. I’m also sending a copy to John as thanks for inviting me to contribute on his blog. If he reads it, I’m sure he’ll let you know what he thinks. So get it, read it, praise it, or trash it if you want; I don’t care. I can at least be proud that I made a serious effort to leave humanity better than I found it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Sennett agrees with me about; that it is an illusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, this "out of date" charge is unjustifiably leveled at non-believers far too often. There are many more Christian apologists, theologians, and philosophers, many of whom are paid to do little more than research, so of course they are spitting out new books every single day, each one of which might be considered the latest research. Atheists are in a minority. Many who teach in the universities who are not tenured are scared of losing their jobs if they write against the Christian faith, and most all of us do not get paid to do research into these topics much less produce as many books in response to this latest research. Just look at the &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,3216,Two-new-fleas-are-discovered,RichardDawkinsnet"&gt;number of “fleas”&lt;/a&gt; Richard Dawkins has in response to his book! Neither he nor any other atheist writer can hope to answer the volumes of books written in response any one of our books. There will always be updated knowledge, anyway, and with the numbers of Christians writing, atheists cannot hope to compete in terms of books and articles. Maybe in the future atheists will outnumber Christian writers and then we can level that charge against them! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the latest research here is a dilemma for Christians who make this charge: if the latest research is needed to defend the Christian faith, then either the reasons to believe prior to it were less than sufficient, or if the latest research is not needed then why should believers care about it now? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said this I don’t doubt that I’m wrong about some things. &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/11/ive-concluded-that-i-am-wrong.html"&gt;I’ve admitted this&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m willing to learn where I am wrong. But I do not think my errors undercut my overall case at all, until or unless my substantive arguments are undercut rather than nitpicking out a minor error or more, here and there. My argument is that how we see things is based upon &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/presuppositions-assumptions-worldviews.html"&gt;control beliefs&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2006/06/control-beliefscontrol_20.html"&gt;control how we view the evidence&lt;/a&gt;. And that case of mine was never undercut by this reviewer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From looking at the other reviews this person wrote on Amazon he or she is a Catholic. Why is it that Catholics seem to be the most outraged at my book? Is it because I dismiss their faith and instead take aim at evangelicalism? I used to be a Catholic in my upbringing. But I reject their faith with the same confidence they reject Islam. I claim that since the Catholic church was seriously wrong with regard to the Inquisition, Slavery, Crusades, Witch Hunts, and protecting child molesting priests in today's world, I have no reason to trust her. I defended this view from another Catholic reviewer &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DMW7425F025E/ref=cm_cr_pr_cmt?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=1591025923&amp;amp;nodeID=#wasThisHelpful"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, while I might be wrong about some things in my book, since I am just one person and I cover so many different topics in it, I think the reviewer grossly mischaracterizes my book. To say I've "never heard" or that I "ignore" or that I have "no response" to something is such an unfair characterization that I suspect the reviewer feels the need to lie in order to defend his or her faith. Here's just one example: it says that when writing about the problem of evil I "ignore the concept of heaven." Not so. See pages 251-52, and 256-57, and 261. Did he or she skip those pages? And on it goes. From this review one could think there is no value at all to my book or that it doesn't contain any good arguments, even though several scholars on both sides of the fence say otherwise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not a review that anyone can trust overall. It has an axe to grind. With the reading skills displayed no wonder he or she believes. It is not fair or objective in any sense at all. I'm still waiting to learn from an educated Christian reviewer who has no axe to grind who will be fair and balanced with my book. &lt;strong&gt;Are there no such reviewers? &lt;/strong&gt;The level of objectivity revealed by this reviewer and others shows they do not have a semblance of objectivity, and if that's the case, how can they claim to have any objectivity at all with regard to their faith? So far, I haven't seen it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

My favorite role of his was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, with The Truman Show as a close second. And of course, only Carrey could have pulled off certain roles, like The Mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I really don’t care to hear his opinions about medicine and science. The obvious point is that Carrey is famous for being a funny man, this fame gives him an audience, but it does not give him the expertise or background to formulate a meaningful opinion about complex scientific questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this kind of statement requires immediate clarification. Everyone is indeed entitled to their own opinion. Carrey has the right to have an opinion on any topic he desires. He can even express that opinion to his family and friends. Everyone also has the right to make their own medical decisions.  Opinions on values and aesthetics are all relative, so no one can claim that theirs are superior to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is an entirely different situation to express your opinion in public to a wide audience on a scientific question of fact. Within science, some ideas are better than others, and some opinions are better than others. The public is best served by being exposed to the opinions of leading experts and the consensus of the scientific community - not comic actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This then leads to the question of responsibility. Carrey is being irresponsible, in my opinion, for spouting off on medical questions to the public. It is the result of supreme arrogance - he thinks he knows better than the consensus opinion of medical experts. I wonder where he thinks his superior insight and knowledge comes from. He does give us a clue - he seems to think that doctors are all trained monkeys who cannot think for themselves or are compromised by “Big Pharma” money. But this opinion is really just more arrogance on his part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think what set off my little tirade against the hubris of famous idiots was Carrey’s infamous embrace of anti-vaccine quackery. It is true, he has allowed himself to be a hapless buffoon of the mercury militia. Not content to be a public menace by increasing the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, Carrey also thinks he can pontificate about mental health as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrey has informed that esteemed journal of medical science, &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20247586,00.html"&gt;People magazine&lt;/a&gt;, that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the medical establishment we’re presented with, it’s a system,” said the comedian. “They’re taught a certain thing. There is drug company money that goes into the educational system. I’m saying you have to look outside that, and consider the other possibilities for people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, so ignore your physician. What does he know? Listen to Dr. Carrey. He believes he cured his own depression with vitamins. He is even happy to agree with Tom Cruise on that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about taking anti-depressants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think Prozac and things like that are very valuable to people for short periods of time,” he said on the show. “But I believe if you’re on them for an extended period of time, you never get to the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you please give us some peer-reviewed references on which you based your opinion, Dr. Carrey. Or is this just fashionable, knee-jerk, anti-drug bias?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden premise in Carrey’s statement is a false choice - medication or therapy to “get to the problem.” In reality the current medical wisdom is that the most effective treatment is a combination of both. In fact, in many cases the very purpose of antidepressant medication is to lift the pall of depression so that the patient can engage in meaningful therapy to deal with their cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise and good nutrition also help, and I recommend them all the time. But like any medical question, there is a great deal of complexity in such questions. Some people have a chronic pathological depression. There is good reason to think that such depressions are biological at their base, and they require biological treatments like anti-depressants. Other people have situational depression, which is likely to be short term. A variety of more conservative approaches, or short term medical treatment, can be effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people with depression have either primary (meaning they cause the depression) or secondary (meaning they result from the depression, but then reinforce it) cognitive and behavior factors in their depression. These seem to respond best to cognitive behavioral therapy - but that is a complex controversy in and of itself. Whether or not talk therapy of some kind can succeed on its own, or requires short or long term medication, is a complex decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may also be medical factors playing a role, again either primary (the ultimate cause) or co-morbid (not causing the depression but making it worse). Sometimes the depression is caused by a medical condition, like thyroid disease. Often it may be caused by sleep deprivation, which itself has its own cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am just scratching the surface of this topic. As always, I must point out that there are good and bad clinicians out there. And some of the bad ones can be truly terrible. What I am referring to is the generally accepted standard of care. It is also what I encounter most often in my experience - thoughtful clinicians who understand the evidence and the controversies, not the trained monkeys of Carrey’s self-serving fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further clarify and anticipate the likely criticism - I am not advocating the paternalism of old where patients just did what their doctors told them. We live in a cooperative model of health care, where everyone is entitled to informed consent. But there is a healthy balance between informed consent and utilizing the expertise of the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrey’s hubris is not in having an opinion - it’s in thinking that because he is famous anyone should care what his opinion on a medical question is. It is in thinking that he knows better than those who have trained for years or decades in a complex and deep medical literature and practice. It is in the casual assumption of moral superiority (an admittedly common failing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly, Carrey’s arrogance is simply part of a broader cultural trend. A proper respect for expertise has been partly sacrificed on the altar of egalitarianism. It still lingers, but in the public arena anti-establishment, sometimes post-modern, and irrationally egalitarian ideals hold sway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I felt I had to go to great pains in this article to explain what years ago was simply taken for granted - the nature and value of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229844734145"><id gr:original-id="http://archaeoporn.wordpress.com/?p=299">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cc4ca62c3b462122</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Archaeology"/><category term="Archaeoporn"/><category term="Looting"/><category term="Preservation"/><category term="Religion"/><category term="Biblical Archaeology Review"/><category term="Hershel Shanks"/><title type="html">Archaeologists as Looters</title><published>2008-12-21T07:29:54Z</published><updated>2008-12-21T07:29:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://archaeoporn.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/archaeologists-as-looters/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://archaeoporn.wordpress.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Kent Flannery once likened the archaeological process to ethnographic work where the informant is killed after fieldwork so that no one else could get to the information.   It is because of this that archaeologists are so protective of the material record to which they have access.   In recent years, perhaps because of the current condition of Iraq, the issue of looting has come to the forefront of these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholarly groups like the &lt;a href="http://www.archaeological.org/"&gt;Archaeological Institute of America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.asor.org/"&gt;American Schools of Oriental Research&lt;/a&gt; have offered a number of ethical and scholarly guidelines meant to stem the tide of looting, or at least limit the archaeological impetus for it.   Among these points is not to ever buy, authenticate, or publish artifacts that do not originate with archaeological proveniences.  Alternatively, when looting appears imminent, governments or other groups can initiate Cultural Resource Management (CRM) projects.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Finally, when necessary and possible, guards are placed on important archaeological sites in order to monitor and protect material remains.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This can come in the form of military guards, armed locals, or park rangers.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;All of these approaches have the benefit of protecting artifacts and allowing for ethical and scientific archaeology.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent issue of Biblical Archaeology Review, Editor Hershel Shanks offers an approach to looting that he favors, turn archaeologists into looters.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Instead of supporting the various efforts of site protection and looting mitigation, Shanks suggests that scholars dig sites and sell their artifacts to museums for funding.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;On the surface this may seem like a reasonable idea, but it is quite problematic, and is more likely an attempt by Shanks to sidestep the efforts of major scholarly organizations to stem looting.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This should come as no surprise as Shanks has effectively staked his name and made a point of supporting, authenticating, publishing, and purchasing looted artifacts.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;If the attempts by credible archaeologists to stem looting took hold across the spectrum of scholars, his publication would largely be out in the cold, and he would have to face the music behind the number forged artifacts he had supported in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest problem, as far as I see it, is the focus that this funding strategy will force on scholars.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Effectively, archaeologists will be forced to produce objects with museum draw in order to get funding.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This would shut down scholars who work with things like faunal analysis or paleoethnobotany.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Generally, museum goers do not want to see a bunch of seeds or some gnawed bones (though I think they rock).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Instead, well preserved ritual objects and rare items will be the greatest target for archaeologists.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This may be a bit of a problem at present, anyway, but this funding plan will certainly exacerbate the problem.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Of course, Shanks will likely not be too concerned with this, since he works largely in the culture-historic archaeology of the Iron Age Levant, and has a history of publishing fantastic items without context, authenticity, or un-forged inscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second problem is the lack of scientific concern in the buy-artifacts funding plan.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Currently, funding applications compete on a basis of wide applicability, potential of publications, and scientific value.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Under the museum oriented plan Shanks proposes, this disappears, leaving behind one of the checks that shapes scholarly work today.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Instead of peer review on projects and possibilities choosing funding, it will be the possibility of aesthetically pleasing finds.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Of course, if buying finds is a source of funding, publication could become a moot concern for many archaeologists.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;For many in the biblical field this is enough of a problem already, and anything that can be done to prevent backsliding should be done.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional concern is the ownership of artifacts.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;If museums are buying artifacts, they own them.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This takes them out of the public sphere and away from the groups that have cultural rights to them.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Archaeologists should by now be familiar with these issues, and recognize the failure required by Shanks’ proposal.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Either archaeologists must sell heritages, or never actually dig sites that would fall under NAGPRA or similar legal or ethical forces.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This is interesting, considering Shanks works primarily with archaeology that occurs in Israel, which owns all of the artifacts in the country.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;If scholars started working under the museum funded model proposed in BAR, Israelite scholarship would grind to a halt.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal put forth by Shanks is not new, and it is as much a failure today as it ever was.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;In fact, the growing understanding of ethics that has appeared in archaeology should let scholars recognize it as an even larger failure than it ever was.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The model of archaeological funding proposed in BAR is an ethical terror and a complete abandonment of the scientific method in favor of antiquated antiquarian looting and the murder of informants without any interviews.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Newton’s equations are still used by NASA when sending vehicles into space.  Of course, Newton was also religious, but he was a man of his time – a time before we knew about evolution, before man had shrunk the need for God as an explanation to just that of a “designer” who tinkers with DNA (according to Michael Behe, anyway).  Perhaps if Newton had been born today he would have been less enamored of religion, just as he would almost certainly not have experimented with alchemy.  Anyway, his religious beliefs in no way diminish his scientific achievements, and his birthday (Newtonmas) should be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s all very well, but recently I’ve become aware of the war on Newtonmas (TWON).  Apparently many Christians, not content with appropriating the Winter solstice celebrations that take place today (Happy Solstice to any pagans reading), and the celebrations and customs of other religions, now want to appropriate the Newtonmas holiday too.  They are even calling TWON, “the war on Christmas.”  How dumb is that?  So I’m going to start with several posts that comment on this absurd “war.”  Here goes…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The War On Christmas (TWOC)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To start us off, Ron Gold presents &lt;a href="http://www.theipu.com/2008/12/war-on-christmas-bill-oreillys-ill.html"&gt;The &amp;quot;War On Christmas&amp;quot;: Bill O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s Ill-Conceived Fight&lt;/a&gt; posted at &lt;a href="http://www.theipu.com/"&gt;The Invisible Pink Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that if you&amp;#39;re concerned with what greeting a store clerk gives you, then maybe you&amp;#39;re really condemning the &lt;em&gt;secularization of the commercialization&lt;/em&gt; of Christmas.  Nice thinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yvette presents &lt;a href="http://bluelinchpin.wordpress.com/2008/12/04/oreilly-holidays-for-christians-only/"&gt;O&amp;#39;Reilly: Holidays For Christians Only&lt;/a&gt; posted at &lt;a href="http://bluelinchpin.wordpress.com"&gt;Blue Linchpin&lt;/a&gt;.

posted at &lt;a href="http://perfectionbeginswhenithurts.blogspot.com/"&gt;...And That&amp;#39;s How You Live With A Curse&lt;/a&gt;, asking, if God is so against abortion, how come he calls so  often for children – including unborn children - to be killed?  I  think we should be told.  (Backed up with Bible quotes.)  Wow.  I guess God needs a hug.  Perhaps he’ll get one if I post some mistletoe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greta Christina presents two posts on what is it like being an atheist in the LGBT community compared with being LGBT in the atheist community.  Part one is &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2008/12/being-an-atheist-in-the-queer-community.html"&gt;Being an Atheist in the Queer Community&lt;/a&gt;, and part two (on what she thinks we should do about it) is &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2008/12/how-to-be-an-ally-with-atheists.html"&gt;How To Be An Ally with Atheists&lt;/a&gt;, posted at &lt;a href="http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/"&gt;Greta Christina&amp;#39;s Blog&lt;/a&gt;.  Greta’s posts are always insightful, and these are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;

And remember, Newton was actually born on December 25th, unlike, er, &lt;a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/December-25.html"&gt;that other guy&lt;/a&gt; whose birthday is also celebrated by many the same day.  Of course, celebrating Newtonmas doesn’t mean you can’t also celebrate Christmas if you want (or Hanukkah, or anything else for that matter).  Santa, trees, presents, turkey etc are not restricted to Christians, so celebrate the day any way you want.  And ho ho ho.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next edition of COTG will be &lt;strong&gt;in three weeks&lt;/strong&gt; time on January 11th, 2009, at &lt;a href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/widget_2.php?&amp;amp;id=10&amp;amp;dt=1229809355096&amp;amp;lmt=1229809354&amp;amp;output=html&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogcarnival.com%2Fbc%2Fcprof_10.html&amp;amp;cc=100&amp;amp;u_h=1000&amp;amp;u_w=1600&amp;amp;u_ah=962&amp;amp;u_aw=1600&amp;amp;u_cd=32&amp;amp;u_tz=-480&amp;amp;u_his=2&amp;amp;u_java=true&amp;amp;u_nplug=31&amp;amp;u_nmime=118"&gt;CyberLizard&amp;#39;s Collection&lt;/a&gt;.  Please submit all entries using the &lt;a href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_10.html"&gt;GOTG submission form&lt;/a&gt; - that way, the host receives your entries via email as nicely ready-formatted html.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I believe Brent is looking for hosts.  Hosting the carnival is a great way to raise the profile of your blog.  Check out the &lt;a href="http://carnivalofthegodless.blogspot.com/"&gt;Carnival of the Godless&lt;/a&gt; page for guidelines and for contact information for hosting requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229833220448"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/prospects_for_science_policy.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/be0df2c31fa8e29c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Prospects for science policy</title><published>2008-12-21T03:40:48Z</published><updated>2008-12-21T03:40:48Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/491088212/prospects_for_science_policy.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/prospects_for_science_policy.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're learning more about what Obama is actually going to do in office, and while there are some negatives, right now the positives outweigh them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's get the &lt;b&gt;bad decisions&lt;/b&gt; out of the way first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.1115.org/2008/12/18/clearly-stated/"&gt;Rick Warren&lt;/a&gt;, professional homophobe, bigot, and smirking airhead, will be prominently promoted in the invocation at the inauguration. This is a symbolic slap to the face of rationalists and GLBT citizens of our country, and is not a good sign.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The man who will be the Interior Secretary, a position which should be concerned about conservation of the country's natural resources and which has been typically filled with vultures and exploiters from industry by Republican presidents, is going to be more of the same: &lt;a href="http://faultline.org/index.php/site/item/why_the_blog_world_frustrates_me_cont/"&gt;Ken Salazar&lt;/a&gt;, who  will almost certainly promote mining and ranching interests.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of those are real disgraces, and it&amp;#39;s not as if Obama was boxed in or lacking alternatives. They&amp;#39;re also incomprehensible. Warren is a sneaky little creep who already got more respect than he deserves by hosting one of the presidential debates, and he&amp;#39;s also a guy who is anti-Democratic policies — you know he did not vote for Obama. So why throw him another bone? Salazar just sounds like a lazy choice, somebody who was picked to appease industry…but he&amp;#39;s not a steward of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bads are awful, but I've got to say that his &lt;b&gt;good decisions&lt;/b&gt; are very, very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy will be &lt;a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/john-holdren"&gt;John Holdren&lt;/a&gt; of Harvard University, a professor of environmental policy who takes a hard line on global climate change — he was an advisor to Al Gore on the movie, &lt;i&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://lubchenco.science.oregonstate.edu/"&gt;Jane Lubchenko&lt;/a&gt; is a professor of marine biology at Oregon State University. She'll be in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, another key appointment in climate change policy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Co-chairs of the Council of Advisers on Science and Technology will be &lt;a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1989/varmus-autobio.html"&gt;Harold Varmus&lt;/a&gt;, who won a Nobel for his work on viral oncogenes, and &lt;a href="http://www.wi.mit.edu/research/faculty/lander.html"&gt;Eric Lander&lt;/a&gt;, a very big name in genomics research.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Another Nobel laureate, &lt;a href="http://www.lbl.gov/Publications/Director/"&gt;Steven Chu&lt;/a&gt;, will be the Secretary of Energy. Chu has also been outspoken about climate change and is a strong promoter of alternative energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If these good people are actually listened to by the president, expect to see major improvements in energy policy and biology research, and some serious attention paid to carbon. This is, overall, a net plus for science and a real strike against anti-science in the White House, a huge change from the last 8 years. Salazar is troubling, &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/20/is-obama-going-to-gut-nasa/"&gt;some people are concerned that NASA will suffer&lt;/a&gt;, and sucking up to the odious Rick Warren still makes me wonder what atavistic social policies might be nestled in Obama's mind, but there is some hope on the horizon, at least. Now if only he could do even better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/prospects_for_science_policy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/491088212" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229827875432"><id gr:original-id="442 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1f8b31128bc24fe8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">LOL-Bailout</title><published>2008-12-21T00:42:07Z</published><updated>2008-12-21T00:42:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/442" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;(HT: BobRayner at the &lt;a href="http://www.badscience.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;amp;t=7090&amp;amp;st=0&amp;amp;sk=t&amp;amp;sd=a#p132190"&gt;BadScience.net Forums&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;

I believe that God, at a moment, created man. I do believe Genesis is literal, but I do also know metaphorical terms are used. Did God come down and blow in man&amp;#39;s nose? If you believe in God, you don&amp;#39;t have a problem accepting miracles. So if God wants to do it that way, it&amp;#39;s fine with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warren’s ignorance of science most likely informs his other positions on gay rights, stem cell research and women&amp;#39;s rights.  Such a man should not have any place in Obama’s inauguration.  Inclusiveness is OK, wrong is just wrong at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229820615933"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2008://2.4076">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d6fd1a654de1e1e0</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Assault on Science" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Creationism" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Religion and Politics" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">Creationist to Give Invocation at Inauguration</title><published>2008-12-20T23:49:32Z</published><updated>2008-12-28T20:44:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/creationist-to.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://pandasthumb.org/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As everyone knows by now, President-Elect Barack Obama has chosen his “friend” Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration.

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Warren’s position on marriage between homosexuals is now widely known, but according to Sarah Posner, writing in  &lt;a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081229/posner?rel=hp_picks" rel="external "&gt;The Nation&lt;/a&gt; magazine, Warren is also a creationist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren, a creationist, believes that homosexuality disproves evolution; he told CNN’s Larry King in 2005, “If Darwin was right, which is survival of the fittest[,] then homosexuality would be a recessive gene because it doesn’t reproduce and you would think that over thousands of years that [sic] homosexuality would work itself out of the gene pool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sic, sic, sic.  I’ll grant that appointing a creationist to give the invocation is not exactly the same as appointing him science adviser, but if it represents the “spirit” of Mr. Obama’s administration, then I am not, shall we say, optimistic that Mr. Obama is truly the agent for change that he purports to be. His science appointments, I thought, have mostly been good ones, but I am utterly appalled by his inviting a homophobic creationist to deliver the invocation at his inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the past six months, for people in the northern hemisphere, every day the peak of the Sun’s arc across the daytime sky has been getting lower. Well, at 12:04 UT it reaches its lowest point, and now every day the Sun will be a bit higher in the sky at local noon. It will peak on June 21 at 05:45 UT, and be at the highest point it can get. Then the process reverses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/EarthSeasons.php"&gt;We call those points in time the solstices&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that half the Earth &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/badseasons.html"&gt;has its seasons reversed&lt;/a&gt;, tonight is the Winter Solstice, and June’s is the Summer Solstice. If you live south of the Equator, sorry, but that’s what you get for living your lives standing on your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the Winter Solstice has always been a time of celebration, because ancient people — more closely tied with the skies due to agriculture and no light pollution — knew that it meant the Sun was coming back up, and spring was coming. We celebrate it in modern times by going into debt. We’re far more sophisticated these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So given the weather here in Boulder the past few weeks, even though I love the snow, I’ll be glad to see the Sun up a little it longer every day. &lt;/p&gt;

Before we could even leave for my son&amp;#39;s commencement at UW Madison, we had to clear the 6&amp;quot;-8&amp;quot; of snow that had fallen overnight from our driveway. Then we had to flounder through unplowed roads to the highway. Then we discovered near-blizzard conditions of blowing snow on the road, but we persevered. We told ourselves that it would get better the farther east we went — Minneapolis always has wimpier weather than we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we got to the freeway…and it got &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt;. The roads were icy and slick, everyone was limping along at half the speed limit (except the idiot drivers of 18-wheelers, who were howling along at over 70mph in the left lane, stirring up billowing clouds of snow as they passed that would blind us all with a temporary white-out), and scattered all along the road were cars that had spun out and ended up in a ditch. We were held up by multiple car crashes. The final straw was when we pulled over to ask at a gas station about conditions further east, and were told a tale of apocalyptic catastrophe further on, with the freeway in both directions snarled with flipped and smashed cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gave up, and came home. It was just too dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are Disappointed Monkeys — we have to miss our son&amp;#39;s graduation. It also means he is stuck in dreary, uninteresting, barren Madison for Christmas, since we planned on bringing him back with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the university will be streaming the &lt;a title="2008 Winter Commencement at the University of Wisconsin-Madison" href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/commencement/"&gt;2008 Winter Commencement at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/a&gt;, so we can watch it, but it's not the same. If any of you happen to be going to the commencement for your own kids (or perhaps because you're graduating, too), could you listen for the name Connlann Myers and give a little whoop and holler for us? We'd like to have been there, but we thought that orphanhood would be a really lousy graduation gift.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Nugent is a symbologist, an expert in ancient symbols. He taught at Seattle University for fifteen years in the Department of Theology and Religious Studies and is an ordained Presbyterian minister.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most Americans know &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/valerie-tarico/is-it-ok-to-celebrate-chr_b_150258.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how Christmas came to be celebrated on December 25&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: The Emperor Constantine chose the date because it was winter solstice in the Julian Calendar, the birthday of dying and rising gods like Mithra and Sol. Some people also know that our delightful melange of Christmas festivities originated in ancient Norse, Sumerian, Roman and Druid traditions - or, in the case of Rudolph, on Madison Avenue. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;But where does the Christmas story itself come from: Jesus in the manger, the angels and wise men?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The familiar Christmas story, including the virgin conception and birth of Jesus, is found in the gospels of Matthew and Luke. Scholars have pointed out that these stories are somewhat disconnected from other parts of these Gospels and the rest of the New Testament. In fact, by the time he is a young boy in the temple, Jesus's parents seem to have forgotten the virgin birth. They act surprised by his odd behavior. There is never any other mention in the New Testament of these incredible events! These stories seem to be an afterthought, written later than the rest of the gospels that contain them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;To make matters more interesting, the stories themselves have inconsistencies and ambiguities - contradictory genealogies, for example. Our Christmas story (singular) is actually a composite. Or consider the idea that Mary is a virgin. The Greek writer of Matthew quotes Isaiah as saying: "a parthenos shall conceive and bear a child." The Hebrew word in Isaiah is "almah," which means simply "young woman." But the Greek word parthenos can mean either a virgin or a young woman, and it got translated as "virgin." Modern Bible translations have corrected this, but it is a central part of the Christmas story.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That's a lot of added complications. If the rest of the New Testament doesn't refer to these stories or need them, then how did we end up with them? Where do they come from?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One part of the answer comes from Hellenistic culture. (It is no accident all New Testament books written in Greek.) In this tradition, when a man did something extraordinary there was the assumption that he did this because he was different, either divine or semi-divine. They would make up a story about how he came to be divine. Almost all Greek heroes were said to be born of a human woman and a god--even Alexander the Great, Augustus and Pythagoras. The father typically was Zeus or Apollo. The god would come and sleep with the woman, pretending to be the husband or as a bolt of lightning, or some such. Greek mythology also shows up in the book of Genesis: the gods lusting after the women and coming down and mating with them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why were they added to the Christian story?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Jewish Christians - the first Christians &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Christ-Origins-Testament-Images/dp/0300084579/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"&gt;didn't believe in the virgin birth&lt;/a&gt;. They believed that Joseph was the biological father of Jesus. Part of their Christology was "adoptionism"--they thought Jesus was adopted as the unique son of God at some time later in life. There were disagreements about when - Mark suggests the baptism, Paul suggests the resurrection.
&lt;br&gt;Over time, &lt;a href="http://trendlines.org/visionmedia/page.aspx?id=430&amp;amp;"&gt;gentile Christianity replaced Jewish Christianity&lt;/a&gt;. There were Jewish-Roman Wars. The Jewish Christians were marginalized and oppressed. The Gentile branch became dominant. Eventually we get the gospel of John which pushes the sonship of Jesus back to the beginning of time. This writer is at the other end of the spectrum from the Jewish Christians. But Matthew and Luke think that the Sonship of Jesus began at birth. And they want to tell a story that reinforces this point. Matthew and Luke are the source of the Christmas story as most of us learned it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn't the writers do a better job of cleaning the contradictions? &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;They did, some. This is called the "orthodox corruption of scripture." (Bart Ehrman &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/04/AR2006030401369.html"&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misquoting-Jesus-Story-Behind-Changed/dp/0060859512/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1229712693&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;) . But it appears that these birth stories were added toward the end, so scripture got frozen before they could get integrated.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was raised that the bible was the literally perfect, "inerrant" word of God, essentially dictated by God to the writers. What you are saying about the Christmas story sure calls into question this point of view. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Which Bible?! There are thousands of manuscript variations. Most biblical stories are probably fiction, not non-fiction. They are mythology in the deepest sense of the word. But we need to get beyond issue of whether biblical reports happened in the historical, physical sense to understand what they mean spiritually and mythically.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok. Back to Christmas. Of all the images from the Christmas story, the one that people fall in love with most is angels. The Christmas story is full of angels, beings of light. Is this because of the solstice tradition? &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Actually it comes from the Hebrew Bible, the Jewish scriptures that were eventually adopted into the Christian Bible as the Old Testament. It also comes from the Jewish literature written between the Old and New Testaments that didn't get into the biblical canon. Some of these are even quoted in the New Testament, for example Enoch, from the 2nd Century BC. It's all about angels.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are angels in these stories? Who are they?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Bible calls them the sons of God, &lt;a href="http://www.thedivinecouncil.com/"&gt;the Divine Council&lt;/a&gt;. The word used for God in parts of the Hebrew Bible, Elohim, is plural implying a family of deities. Angels are the lesser gods of the deposed pantheon of ancient Israel. They are under the rulership of Yahweh. Together with Yahweh they are part of Elohim, a plural word that we translate "God" in the book of Genesis. Elohim/God says "Let us make humans in our image." Christians understand this to refer to the trinity, but that is a later interpretation. These angels came from the ancient pantheons of Mesopotamia and Egypt. Many of these gods come from stars. There is a strong astral dimension. "Heavenly Hosts" are stars.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The Luke story focuses on one angel specifically: Gabriel. Is he the archangel? Gabriel is the Angel of the Lord. He is one of two angels who are named in the Jewish canon and the Christian canon outside of the apocrypha: Gabriel and Michael. They are the angels of mercy and judgment. Gabriel means "Strong One of El." He is first named in Daniel.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;If you go into an Eastern Orthodox church you have two icons on the north and south. Michael is on the North to fight with Satan who lives there. Gabriel is on the south. He is more like what the angels originally were, which is messengers of the gods. That is what angel means. The idea that God has a special messenger is exactly what we read about in the Middle Eastern mythologies. Each of the earlier gods has his own special messenger. Enki, who becomes Yaweh, has Isimud. The goddess Inana has Ninshubur. Each high god will have an envoy or assistant, who is a lesser god. The angel of the lord is the same thing. The distinction between angels and gods came later.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is he a star person? Or one of those semi-divine descendents of gods and women?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;He is one of the gods who would come down to earth.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you say that? &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The offspring of the gods mating with women are called Gaborim--from the same root as Gabriel. In the second century, Gabriel appears in the Epistula Apostolorum. It talks about Jesus and these secret teachings that he gave to his apostles after the resurrection. One of the secrets is that he is actually Gabriel. After Gabriel took on flesh and united with Mary, then he becomes Jesus. The idea that Christ was an angel was extremely popular in the early church. Later we find this really strict separation between humans and angels; between gods and angels. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/9004132244?tag=theologicalso-20&amp;amp;link_code=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=9004132244&amp;amp;creative=9310&amp;amp;camp=2506"&gt;(more)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have time for just one more favorite Christmas story: The Star of Bethlehem and the Magi. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://webzoom.freewebs.com/courtneyroberts/srpaper.doc"&gt;The Magi are astrologers&lt;/a&gt;. They are Zoroastrian priests. Just to the east of the Roman Empire was the Persian Empire, which was Zoroastrian. They see this star at its rising (the better translations don't say in the East). The astrologers paid a lot of attention to this. It is likely that what this refers to was a heliacal rising, which is the first time that a star appears over the horizon during the course of a year. They thought this was a sign of the Jewish messiah. Scholars speculate that they would have been living in Babylon, where there were lots of Jewish merchants. The Jews had been there from the time of the Jewish exile from Babylonia. We have cuneiform records from them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you assuming that this story is historical?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Think of it as a frog and pond. The pond is real, the frog is not. They are fictional stories in a real setting. They don't always get the details of the setting right, but they are fictional characters in real places. The Magi follow their star from Jerusalem to Bethlehem. The author has in mind a real star that would be in front of you in this situation. There are two candidates, Canopus or Alpha Centauri. Those two stars are visible for approx 6 mo of year, Canopus from about the fall equinox to spring equinox and Alpha Centauri from about November to May.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Remember what I said about the Heavenly Host being stars? The star in Matthew and the angel in Luke are two variants of the same mythology.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My former fundamentalist head is spinning. Is there anything else you'd like to say in closing?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We need to be able to appreciate these stories as myths, rather than literal histories. When you understand where they come from, then you can understand their spiritual significance for the writers and for us.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That sounds like another interview. Thank you. &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevalence findings from special education data do not support the claim of an autism epidemic because the administrative prevalence figures for most states are well below epidemiological estimates. The growing administrative prevalence of autism from 1994 to 2003 was associated with corresponding declines in the usage of other diagnostic categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;PEDIATRICS Vol. 117 No. 4 April 2006, pp. 1028-1037 (doi:10.1542/peds.2005-1516)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, on the internet, there doesn’t seem to be a shortage of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;assumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that there is indeed an autism epidemic in our elementary, junior, and high schools. Here’s one that seems fairly typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this, in light of current special education enrollment at 10–12 % and rising rapidly, due to epidemics of allergies and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="http://srdad.com/SrDad/Autism/Entries/2008/6/16_To_gag_or_not_gag,_that_is_the_question.html"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it’s very clear that autism &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; have risen, and perhaps that means that a slow tedious trend towards the most appropriate accomodations and inclusion could be in its early stages. But, are there “epidemics” that are causing special education enrollment in our public schools to “rise rapidly”? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s back up just a second, away from cause, and just ask the question, “is special education enrollment rising rapidly”?&lt;/p&gt;

Now Mark Peters, who has helped bring snowclones to the masses in articles for &lt;a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20060718-000008.html"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3613/is_200607/ai_n17171280"&gt;Columbia Journalism Review&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.good.is/?p=13907"&gt;Good&lt;/a&gt;, has created an even cozier online niche: a blog devoted to a single snowclone. It's called "&lt;a href="http://rosaparksofblogs.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Rosa Parks of Blogs&lt;/a&gt;," and as you can guess from the title it's based on the "X is the Y of Z" snowclone, discussed &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003394.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005495.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=806"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Mark explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody is the Rosa Parks of something—or at least the Michael Phelps, Cap'n Crunch, Dick Cheney, Elmer Fudd, or Paris Hilton of whatever. This blog collects examples of the adaptable idiom "X is the Y of Z", which is a snowclone. Feel free to use these descriptions when discussing your beautiful children, longtime companions, sworn enemies, favorite foods, and elected congressvermin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So far Mark has already rounded up these examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Yoko Ono of Saturday morning cartoons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Dr. Phil of pandas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Larry David of Swedish indie music&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Foghorn Leghorn of evolutionary thinkers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Magic Johnson of the Bible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The John Donne of pizza writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Adam and Eve of mathematics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Tori Amos of giant monsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Clint Eastwood of cows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Barry Bonds of apple crisps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Count Chocula of politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Abe Vigoda of the super-villain community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The Michael Phelps of poop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really does seem like a bottomless well. Best of luck to Mark in this joyfully absurdist project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail a year or so ago, then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama said he would cut NASA money to help fund education. Then he changed his tune, saying he would add money to NASA’s budget to help ease the transition from the Shuttle era — which will end abruptly with the last Shuttle launch in 2010 — to the age of Constellation, NASA’s program for future manned spaceflight using the new Ares rockets, still being designed and built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3123314866/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3114/3123314866_1bf2929320_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted he said that while stumping in Florida and Texas, both of which are major states supporting NASA; they’re the homes of NASA’s Kennedy and Johnson space centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/11/nasas-griffin-butting-heads-with-obama/"&gt;Then came rumors&lt;/a&gt; that NASA chief Mike Griffin was giving Obama’s NASA transition team a lot of static. Griffin denounced those rumors, but that doesn’t do much in real life to dispel them; denials never do. And so the whispers still exist that Constellation may suffer cuts, drastic or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/the_search_for_knowledge_truth_and_a_greater_understanding_of_the_world_aro/"&gt;Obama is making an incredibly strong showing of his support for science&lt;/a&gt;. Nobel Laureate &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/11/obama-asks-a-scientist-to-run-energy-department/"&gt;Steven Chu&lt;/a&gt; will head the Department of Energy. Physicist &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/18/breaking-obama-to-pick-a-physicist-for-science-advisor/"&gt;John Holdren&lt;/a&gt; will be his science advisor. &lt;a href="http://lucile.science.oregonstate.edu/lubchenco/"&gt;Jane Lubchenco&lt;/a&gt; will head the NOAA. These people are all highly-trained scientists at the top of their game, not policy wonks or campaign contributors or just plain old buddies grossly unqualified to run a lemonade stand, let alone a government agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fresh wind is blowing through the White House, and it’s taking away the stench of antiscience. To doubly mix a metaphor, it looks like the jackbooted heel that’s been at the throat of science for eight years is about to get the boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still and all… where does NASA fit in with all this? &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/24/a-stern-warning/"&gt;It has always been scrutinized for wasting money&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not surprising, given how high profile NASA missions are, and how expensive they seem. When an astronaut loses a $100,000 tool bag over the side of the space station, it seems like a colossal boondoggle. But that ignores the details: you can’t just take a canvas tote bag into space; the materials have to withstand a vacuum, not disintegrate when the air is gone, not leak out toxins when the pressure drops, be accessible in microgravity and by astronauts’ bulky gloves, and so on. There is no simple stuff when you’re dealing with space travel. Complexity equals cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s orders of magnitude worse when a probe is lost. The instant a Mars spacecraft goes missing, the first thing the newspapers report is &amp;quot;The 200 million dollar Mars probe…&amp;quot;. Heck, they do that when things go &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in reality, &lt;em&gt;NASA is cheap&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/11/21/nasas-budget-as-far-as-americans-think/"&gt;It comprises less than 1% of the U.S. annual budget&lt;/a&gt;. It’s paid for itself a dozen times over (did you know that digital cameras are a direct descendant of the detectors used in Hubble’s Wide Field/Planetary Camera?). We get so much out of it, for what is in reality so little cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we’re in a recession. The economy is tanking, and politicians need to look like (or actually indicate) they are fiscally responsible. Now, when you have a full hard drive, it makes more sense to delete that 4 Gb movie you’ve already seen rather than manually delete a bunch of 4K text files. But politicians aren’t like that. They go after highly-visible targets, even if they are only a tiny fraction of the problem. And NASA’s head sticks way, way out. Cutting it may look responsible… even &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/12/28/terror-20-million-per-hour/"&gt;when we still spend $20 million dollars per hour&lt;/a&gt; on a war started for no reason, when a large fraction of the hundreds of billions of dollars given as a blank check to the bank bailout program might as well have been shredded, and when there are far larger government agencies than NASA that wouldn’t be able to fund their catering bill with the cost of NASA’s lost tool bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-nasa19-2008dec19,0,7509135.story"&gt;there are reports that Obama is looking very closely at NASA’s budget&lt;/a&gt;. I agree — quite strongly — that NASA really needs to tighten up its budget management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But NASA is a drop in the government’s bucket as far as money goes.&lt;/strong&gt; And that is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; bucket. If I had Obama’s ear, I would tell him this: put a team on NASA. Have them look over its management, see where improvements can be made, and recommend implementations so that it runs a tighter ship. &lt;em&gt;But we need that ship.&lt;/em&gt; There are many, many places to go looking for money that can be used to fund needed programs, money that is being wasted as quickly as it’s printed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA doesn’t need budget cuts. It needs better fiscal management, and it needs more money. Money to build bigger telescopes that take pictures of surpassing beauty, images of distant realms that inspire children and make adults gasp in awe. Money to build satellites that study our home planet and see what man has wrought. Money to research how to build better airplanes (that’s what the first &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; in NASA is, after all). Money to reach out and touch other worlds. And money to design cheaper access to space to make all this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA is flawed, of course. &lt;em&gt;It’s a government bureaucracy&lt;/em&gt;. But it doesn’t need much to keep it going, and going better. NASA is a symbol. It shows us the best of what we can achieve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying the Universe, exploring it, trying to understand it, is part of what makes us human.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need that, and it costs so little. I hope some of the brilliant scientists Obama has chosen to advise him can make that point to him. I would consider it one of their most important duties.&lt;/p&gt;

Allen discusses the social effects of the change to a smaller and all-volunteer military in the U.S. over the past 35 years, from what used to be a larger force mainly made up of draftees. She argues that "the map of military service since 1973 aligns closely with electoral maps distinguishing red from blue states"; and she suggests that this is a bad thing, because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Military institutions across nations and throughout time have always been important creators of culture. They strive to develop unbreakable bonds of solidarity among their members based on shared values, experiences and outlooks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her conclusion is that there should be &amp;quot;a new structure for national service&amp;quot; — though she avoids the issue of whether it should be mandatory — in order to &amp;quot;weave a fabric of shared citizenship anew&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with her general position about the value of military service in creating a shared culture. But she gives a prominent role to a linguistic argument that I found unconvincing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the passage that failed to convince me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In this country, the military's leadership role in racial integration has been understood in just this way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The issue now is not racial integration but cultural separation. If young people from different regions and social backgrounds either enter or steer clear of the armed forces, military service will become, over time, an experience that doesn't ease but exacerbates preexisting cultural differences. Is the all-volunteer military already having this effect?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I spotted the link between military service and regional partisan divisions when I was researching not military history but Internet political communication. After spending time on political Web sites of the right and left, I noticed that posts on right-leaning sites often employed military lingo — habits of developing monikers and jingles and of using the vocabulary of military tactics and strategy. Left-leaning sites, in contrast, mostly lacked any easily recognizable features of military language.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;This is one sign that our public sphere already suffers from a division between military and non-military cultures. The division is not trivial, and without institutional change it is likely to be durable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument about "military lingo" doesn't convince me partly because her generalization doesn't match my remembered experience as a long-time reader of web sites of all political persuasions. It also seems to me that there are general reasons not to expect a big effect of this kind.  Some people get military lingo from books or  movies or computer games rather than from real-life military experience; and linguistic influences can in any case linger long after the associated experiences are gone ( e.g. "free rein","unbridled", "saddle up").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mostly, I don&amp;#39;t put much stock in anyone&amp;#39;s quantitative impressions about this sort of thing, since I know  that such impressions — mine and everyone else&amp;#39;s — often turn out to be wrong. We tend to notice and remember things based on how salient they seem to us, which is often not the same as how often they actually occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is there any evidence about this question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A check via Google Scholar and other web-search options suggests that Prof. Allen hasn't yet published anything to back up her observation. There's a body of quantitative research on vaguely relevant topics, e.g. Kathleen Durant and Michael Smith, "&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/a346123m37147020/"&gt;Predicting the Political Sentiment of Web Log Posts Using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques Coupled with Feature Selection&lt;/a&gt;", WebKDD 2006. However, I don't know of any work that specifically addresses the geographical distribution of political sentiment on the web, much less its relationship to the linguistic residue of military service. In fact, I don't know of any accessible corpus of political web-site content classified by political position and/or geographical origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought I&amp;#39;d try a quick check in the other direction, by searching a general index of weblogs — unclassified as to political position and geography — for a word associated with military tactics and strategy. If Prof. Allen is right, we&amp;#39;d expect to see (among the hits of American origin) a preponderance of red-state locations and right-leaning politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with &lt;a href="http://search.technorati.com/outflank"&gt;outflank&lt;/a&gt;. The only locations that I could determine on the first page of hits were Washington (state) and South Dakota — one blue and one red. There were three overtly political pages — one seems to be &lt;a href="http://truediatribe.blogspot.com/2008/12/is-this-dude-for-real.html"&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt;, one seems to be &lt;a href="http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Article.aspx?id=3048"&gt;center-left&lt;/a&gt;, and the third is a reprint &lt;a href="http://www.socialistunity.com/?p=3179"&gt;from the Socialist Workers Party&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the early returns are not favorable to Prof. Allen's hypothesis, although this is way too little information to license any general conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have access to a database of blog posts categorized by political affiliation (unlikely) or geographical origin (more likely)? If so, we could check the geographical distribution of "military lingo" in comparison to (say) knitting terms, or architectural metaphors, or whatever. I remain skeptical that this would turn up linguistic evidence of a deepening cultural divide, even if Prof. Allen is right about the cultural developments. But I could be wrong, as I often am about such things.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229798906796"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/?p=1036">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4f74efcdfdb53aa1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Map of science</title><published>2008-12-20T18:10:28Z</published><updated>2008-12-20T18:10:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/2008/12/map-of-science/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">As I am a Beaver and Steve Hsu is a Duck, we are sworn enemies.

Handley, originally scheduled for today, &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/9yfbq2"&gt;has been postponed&lt;/a&gt;. In the meanwhile, you can let the show’s producers know what questions you would like to hear McCarthy, Handley and Kurtz answer. You can email your questions and comments to:   larrykingguests@cnn.com .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. King:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well intentioned as you may be, you are not doing children any favors when you invite Jenny McCarthy and her friends to spread misinformation about vaccines and autism. McCarthy’s most basic claims are unsupportable, and her statements about vaccine ingredients are demonstrably false. But that has not discouraged some in the news and entertainment media from handing McCarthy unchallenged public forums to repeat her baseless allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do invite McCarthy back, could you please ask her some challenging questions so that parents can better decide if she is qualified to speak for them? Here are a few that come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is your medical science adviser? Did he/she tell you that vaccines contain anti-freeze and ether?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you define “recovery” from autism?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you refer to the “explosion” in autism diagnoses over the last 25 years, are you referring to autistic disorder only, or all pervasive development disorders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of today’s 3-5 year olds have never received a vaccine containing thimerosal. So why haven’t ASD diagnoses fallen among that cohort?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formaldehyde is a natural bi-product of single carbon metabolism, and the quantities found in an infant’s blood are several times greater than what is contained in any five pediatric vaccines combined. Why do you believe that formaldehyde, in the quantities found in vaccines, is harmful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Evan’s autism diagnosis medical or educational?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Evan’s “recovery” from autism affect his status as an Indigo Child?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions for Mr. Kurtz:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a high school drop out, are you concerned that you &lt;a href="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=715#comment-46335"&gt;may not have the necessary science education&lt;/a&gt; and background to fully appreciate the complexities of immunology, pediatric neurology, toxicology, and other scientific disciplines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the status of DAN!’s relationship with the American Academy of Pediatrics? Are you still optimistic that unproven bio-medical treatments for autism &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoaXNJQBzC0"&gt;will soon go “mainstream”&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions for Mr. Handley:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You recently wrote in the comment section of a skeptical science blogger that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php#comment-1269975"&gt;the other side is winning&lt;/a&gt;, since most research dollars are going to projects that are unsupported by groups such as Generation Rescue. Why has the mainstream science community so roundly rejected your claims?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why have you never offered solid proof that children have “recovered” from autism? How do you define recovery?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You claim that the symptoms of autism are nearly identical to the symptoms of mercury poisoning. &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/111/3/674"&gt;It is well documented&lt;/a&gt; that fetal exposure to mercury leads to microcephaly in infants. But in autism, head and brain sizes are larger than in neurotypical infants. How do you explain this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do the autism community a favor and show some skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229791807723"><id gr:original-id="tag:pandasthumb.org,2008://2.4075">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/92bb6fff033976b2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Education and Legal" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><category term="Kitzmiller Ruling" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">Three Years Already?

&lt;p&gt;Ah, the memories of Kitzmas past.

&lt;p&gt;Even though the Creationist Choir says that Kitzmiller v. Dover is &lt;a href="http://sensuouscurmudgeon.wordpress.com/2008/12/20/three-years-since-dover-merry-kitzmas/" rel="external "&gt;“No big deal”&lt;/a&gt;, it’s obvious they’re still smarting over their wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, “Intelligent Design” is so yesterday.  Everyone knows &lt;a href="http://www.nmsr.org/stork.htm" rel="external "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths and Weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the Big New Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My middle child, the cute and monkey-like Connlann, is graduating from the University of Wisconsin Madison tomorrow, with a degree in English. Hooray for the hard work and success of our boy! Hooray for rituals of completion! Hooray for the end of chunky great tuition payments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, anyway, I shall be spending most of my time today driving, and most of tomorrow driving, and a good spell of tomorrow sitting in uncomfortable seats watching a ceremonial parade of strangers, but it is all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just heard &lt;a href="http://www.skepticzone.tv/"&gt;the new episode of the Australian podcast Skeptic Zone&lt;/a&gt; with the charming and dashing Richard Saunders — this one has a wonderful interview with the totally awesome &lt;a href="http://www.astronomycast.com/"&gt;Pamela Gay&lt;/a&gt;, who talks up astronomy and &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy2009.org/"&gt;the International Year of Astronomy 2009&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after that, at about 25 minutes in, first year University astronomy student and Aussie skeptic Tiffany Day reviews my book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I won’t give away what she says, but I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; mention that she is an unusually intelligent and perceptive person.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229787377633"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/good_media_bad_media.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f57da842b408238b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Good media, bad media</title><published>2008-12-20T14:04:47Z</published><updated>2008-12-20T14:04:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/490596719/good_media_bad_media.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/good_media_bad_media.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php"&gt;had a bit of fun&lt;/a&gt; with an "old friend," namely J.

&lt;p&gt;I heard a rumor that CNN’s show, &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/larry.king.live/"&gt;Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;, may feature guests from &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php"&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt; this weekend. This isn’t really surprising, as like many radio or TV talk shows, the Larry King Live show often seems to be fond of pet celebrities, wild claims, and entertaining fluff, over scientific reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Mr. King will ask a real question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What would you say to those people who might refer to you as conspiracy theorist nutjobs with your claims that vaccines cause autism and that the government is covering it all up?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they’d be likely to make ill-conceived comparisons of themselves to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Gambit"&gt;Gallileo&lt;/a&gt; or carefully change the subject (i.e. they wouldn’t provide scientific evidence that vaccines actually cause autism, and they probably won’t provide evidence of a vast government and medical community cover-up), they are also likely to mention things that fit right in line with the excerpt at the end of this post, from a fantastic article in &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article, &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526121.300-the-lure-of-the-conspiracy-theory.html"&gt;The Lure of The Conspiracy Theory&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/web/about_us/pages/patrlema.html"&gt;Dr. Patrick Leman&lt;/a&gt;, is a fascinating peek at some forthcoming research and some of the reasons that conspiracy theories garner belief. For instance, Leman explains the seduction of “major event - major cause” reasoning, where “people often assume that an event with substantial, significant or wide-ranging consequences is likely to have been caused by something substantial, significant or wide-ranging”. Leman further explains that such reasoning is seductive because it prevents a chaotic and unpredictable relationship between cause and effect (as might be the case when major effects have minor and mundane causes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, if you happen (or are drawn to it like watching a car accident) to watch Larry King Live this weekend, and Generation Rescue is on, make sure to watch for what they talk about to fit some of the themes presented by Leman in the New Scientist article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Excerpted from The Lure of The conspiracy Theory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the perfect conspiracy theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick your adversary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A sense of anomie (dislocation from society and authority) fuels beliefs in conspiracy theories, so pick a big bad organisation of some sort - government or big business is ideal&lt;br&gt;
For added spice, identify a shadowy, secretive society with implied links to your adversary: the more shadowy, the better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose your event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You’ll need a big, contemporary newsworthy event around which to weave your theory&lt;br&gt;
If it’s a sudden, shocking visual occurrence of international import it is more likely to become a “flashbulb memory” for the masses. Your key conspiracy audience, most able to create such vivid “indelible” memories will be between the ages of 20 and 35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop your story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Construct your theory from carefully selected information that weaves together into a compelling story&lt;br&gt;
If something doesn’t fit, reinterpret it in line with your theory&lt;br&gt;
Create uncertainty: question existing evidence or find new evidence that contradicts the “official” account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare your defence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If someone highlights a gap or inconsistency in your evidence, don’t be afraid to tweak your story, but keep the core conspiracy in place&lt;br&gt;
You can allow the finer details of the theory to mutate, but always keep in mind the maxim - “they did it, I just have to find the proof that they did it”&lt;br&gt;
Broaden the circle of conspirators to include those who question your position… “they’re denying the truth - they must be involved too!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, and look for “amazing” autism treatment claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated: 12/20/2008&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orac&lt;/strong&gt; weighs in with &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/good_media_bad_media.php"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Media, Bad Media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, apparently, &lt;strong&gt;the show has been postponed&lt;/strong&gt; (in favor of a rerun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/larry-king-live-postponed-for-rerun.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;We regret to inform our readers that Larry King Live’s program&lt;br&gt;
featuring Jenny McCarthy, Stan Kurtz and J.B. Handley of Generation&lt;br&gt;
Rescue has been postponed.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism News Beat&lt;/strong&gt; poses some excellent questions about this, in a post titled, “&lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=122"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Mr. King: Please show some skepticism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;

But I am temporarily suspending this for the holidays. No matter what I do it's time consuming for me to moderate comments and/or when not moderating them to delete comments that do not meet our comment policy. We have Blog terrorists who hit every so often. In addition I receive many emails a day to answer (which I'm no longer publishing on my profile), and people make comments on over 1400 past posts, some of which require a response from me. I'm also trying to write another book on the &lt;em&gt;Darwinian Problem of Evil&lt;/em&gt;. On some days we need Blog maintenance (right now the "Recent Comments" link isn't properly working). So for the holidays enjoy what we write. This is only temporary. If you must comment do it on your own Blogs. Sorry, I need to do this. I hope you understand. Cheers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

According to the San Francisco &lt;cite&gt;Chronicle&lt;/cite&gt;, Adams told the victim "that her husband would die of a heart attack if she didn't immediately pay $13,000 for 'special prayers,' the prosecutor said."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On subsequent visits, the purported psychic extracted more and more money from the elderly victim, until her (still-healthy) husband noticed the odd transactions.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;cite&gt;Chronicle&lt;/cite&gt; explains that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams has victimized numerous women in San Mateo County in the past and was sent to state prison in 2004 for two years on a theft conviction, authorities said. At that time, Adams worked as a palm reader at the Half Moon Bay Pumpkin Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My crystal ball tells me that the victim, who visited Adams the first time "on a lark," has learned her lesson.  Hopefully Adams will learn hers, too.&lt;/p&gt;

Ed lives in Philly (where Mark Liberman&amp;#39;s swank executive suite is located), and was in LA on business. I&amp;#39;ve visited Ed a few times back East since I moved to California, but this is the first time he&amp;#39;s come out here — he says his excuse is that he&amp;#39;s got a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; job and &amp;quot;kids&amp;quot; — so I felt it was worth the 5-6 hours of total driving time to have dinner with Ed (and two of his co-workers, as it turned out) and drive him to the airport to catch his red-eye flight back East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed ended up missing his flight, which is why I thought he had announced to the (twittering) world that &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/edkeer/statuses/1067913415"&gt;I am dead to him&lt;/a&gt;, but it turns out that he's just upset with me for not posting the latest in his comic series, &lt;a href="http://watchmesleep.blogspot.com/search/label/comic"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pigeontown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Arnold posts &lt;i&gt;Zippy&lt;/i&gt; and Mark posts &lt;i&gt;Zits&lt;/i&gt;; why don't you post &lt;i&gt;Pigeontown&lt;/i&gt; already?", Ed said to me, apparently while his plane was leaving the gate at LAX. So, in part to get myself back in Ed's good graces (maybe) but also because it happens to have actual linguistics content (about which see below the fold), here's &lt;a href="http://watchmesleep.blogspot.com/2008/12/wednesday-comic_17.html"&gt;the latest &lt;i&gt;Pigeontown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (click image to enlarge):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ed035.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/ed035.jpg" alt="" title="pigeontown" width="500" height="198"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference in this comic is to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, discussed many times here on Language Log (just search for "whorf" and you'll find plenty of posts, both &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/index.php?s=whorf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=001269089414569134552%3Aqvjtfauf7ou&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=whorf&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;LL Classic&lt;/a&gt;), which is often the point of discussion when the old Eskimo-words-for-snow canard is brought up. When Geoff Pullum wrote "The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax" in 1989, he quoted the following passage from a linguistics textbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvious that in the culture of the Eskimos … snow is of great enough importance to split up the conceptual sphere that corresponds to one word and one thought in English into several distinct classes…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate how ridiculous this claim is, Geoff wrote the following variation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is quite obvious that in the culture of printers … fonts are of great enough importance to split up the conceptual sphere that corresponds to one word and one thought among non-printers into several distinct classes…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed's comic is, of course, another variation on this quotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ritualistic Baal worship, in sum, looked a little like this: Adults would gather around the altar of Baal. Infants would then be burned alive as a sacrificial offering to the deity. Amid horrific screams and the stench of charred human flesh, congregants - men and women alike - would engage in bisexual orgies. The ritual of convenience was intended to produce economic prosperity by prompting Baal to bring rain for the fertility of "mother earth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what do you think that reminds him of? I think I'm wrong: he's not making a metaphor, he's saying that modern-day liberals are the direct descendant of Baal worshippers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern liberalism deviates little from its ancient predecessor. While its macabre rituals have been sanitized with flowery and euphemistic terms of art, its core tenets and practices remain eerily similar. The worship of "fertility" has been replaced with worship of "reproductive freedom" or "choice." Child sacrifice via burnt offering has been updated, ever so slightly, to become child sacrifice by way of abortion. The ritualistic promotion, practice and celebration of both heterosexual and homosexual immorality and promiscuity have been carefully whitewashed - yet wholeheartedly embraced - by the cults of radical feminism, militant "gay rights" and "comprehensive sex education." And, the pantheistic worship of "mother earth" has been substituted - in name only - for radical environmentalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I think modern conservatism is descended from ritual cannibalism, so there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Olivier Messiaen, "Turangalila - Symphonie: II. Chant d'amour 1"&lt;/b&gt;: This
was an unexpected wonderful surprise. A few years ago, my older brother gave me
a book on Stockhausen, who is a fascinating guy on an intellectual level, but
whose music I find absolutely unlistenable. The book talks about Stockhausen's period studying with Messiaen. I was expecting Messiaen to be another one of "those 12-tone guys"; I've never been able to develop an ear for 12-tone. But I decided to give Messiaen
a listen, and was amazed. He's not exactly an easy listen, but it's beautiful music. It's
very dissonant, frequently atonal, and yet melodic. This section of the symphony is extremely dramatic, almost theatrical. It's really a beautiful piece of music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter Schickele, "Funeral Oration from 'Julius Ceasar'"&lt;/b&gt;: from the sublime to ridiculous... A doo-wop funeral oration based on Shakespeare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Tempest, "The Winning Game"&lt;/b&gt;: What a great song! I've lately totally fallen
for "The Tempest". It's a group that started as a collaboration between Andy Tillison and Roine Stolte. They've got members from Tillison's old band (Parallel or 90 degrees),
Stolte's band (the Flower Kings), and Van Der Graff Generator. It's some of the best
neo-progressive rock you'll find anywhere. Stolte later left their band, which resulted
in a serious change in the band's sound, but both before and after Stolte, they're
an amazing group, with wonderful compositions and absolutely dazzling performances. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;King Crimson, "Frame by Frame"&lt;/b&gt;: One of the things that King Crimson has been
able to do is to combine some of the most far-out experimental progressive rock with
some wonderfully catchy, easy-to-listen-to pop songs. This is a great example of that;
Frame by Frame is a very catchy poppy song, and yet it's incredibly deep and complex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Porcupine Tree, "Dislocated Day"&lt;/b&gt;: some older Porcupine Tree. PT did one
  really wacky album of mostly very long-form neo-progressive tapestries. This is off
 of that album.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "Essence"&lt;/b&gt;: a track off of Marillion's brilliant new album. Just
  go buy it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Isis, "Holy Tears"&lt;/b&gt;: what were the odds that I could get through a FRT 
  without some post-rock? Isis is a post-rock band on which leans towards the
  heavy-metal end of the post-rock spectrum. They're terrific - great composition,
  great performance. They do sometimes use vocals, which is fine; but a bit too
  often, the vocals are distorted shrieks. This track uses a bit of that; it's OK
  in moderation; in fact, I really like this track a lot. But listening to too much
  Isis at a time, that use of shrieking growl vocals gets to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, "Misunderstood"&lt;/b&gt;: I used to be a huge
  Flecktones fan. But I &lt;em&gt;despise&lt;/em&gt; Jeff Cofflin, the saxaphone player they added
  a few years ago. I just simply cannot stand to listen to the guy - he's absolutely
  awful. He's incredibly predictable - the guy's got the creativity of a
  a small rock; he knows how to play at exactly one volume - too damned loud;
  and he's in love with stupid gimmicks. He's playing on this track, so guess
  what I think of it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tony Trischka, "Hawaii Slide-O"&lt;/b&gt;: interesting that this came up in the shuffle
  right after Bela. Tony is Bela's former banjo teacher. (I've taken lessons from Tony
  as well; Tony is a great guy who's happy to give lessons to &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who's
  interested.) This track is Tony experimenting with playing slide banjo. Back when
  I was taking lessons with him, I heard an early version of this track - he was
  showing me what he was working on at the time, and he'd just started playing with
  a slide on the banjo for the first time in years. Tony is a fabulous musician,
  and I love everything on this album. (In fact, I can't think of anything Tony's done
  which I haven't loved.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rachel's, "Where have all my files gone?"&lt;/b&gt;: more post-rock, this time from the
  classical end of things. Rachel's is an amazing group. This is very typical of their
  sound. Very atmospheric, beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I was reading a post about this topic on &lt;em&gt;The Atheist’s Way&lt;/em&gt; earlier today. It was specifically about religion, but the topic could be expanded to other areas, such as alternative medicine and the paranormal, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa belongs to a crafting group made up of mostly Christians. At a recent get together, the woman sitting next to her made some incredibly stupid comments, ending with…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, look what happened to New Orleans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa’s response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was flabbergasted. Of course, I know that there are people who actually think that way. They see natural catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina as god’s judgment for sin, and even when I was a Christian, I considered that idea utterly preposterous and appalling. I remember people of faith proclaiming that AIDS was god’s judgment on homosexuality and shaking my head in disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rarely do I have to sit next to such stunning ignorance, though. Most of the people I know, even the Christians, don’t think that way, and if they do, they keep it to themselves. I sat next to this woman feeling a small war within myself. Should I speak up? Should I point out the obscenity of her assertion that all of the innocent people who died in that disaster deserved it because of some imagined “sinfulness” of New Orleans as a whole? Or should I let it go, not afford her the dignity of any response?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out what Melissa did, and read the whole post &lt;a href="http://theatheistsway.blogspot.com/2008/12/seasoned-with-reason-stunning-ignorance.html?showComment=1229719620000#c4544817162915481696"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When and how should we speak up when we hear people say things that are just plain ignorant? And when is it not worth it? What’s the best way to engage people in a discussion, rather then just slapping them down as fools? I know we discuss this a lot here, but I think at this time of year, when many of us spend more time with believing friends and relatives than we normally do, it’s good to think about how we will respond if (when?) weird topics come up in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>writerdd</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229724073693"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-6201862973592251504">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf73124d33062e33</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">There is No OT Prophecy Fulfilled in the Life, Death or Resurrection of Jesus</title><published>2008-12-19T20:48:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-21T14:30:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/490003797/there-is-no-ot-prophecy-fulfilled-in.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/6201862973592251504/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=6201862973592251504" title="1 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/there-is-no-ot-prophecy-fulfilled-in.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">That's my claim, Christian.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took this picture from the cockpit of a Gulfstream II business jet. It typically cruises at .82 Mach and altitudes up to 45,000 feet. The photo was taken about 300 nautical miles west of Bermuda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. If you look carefully, just under the Moon is a triangular shadow pointing up at the Moon. I suspect that’s a shadow of a cloud. I’ve seen this many times flying myself, though not at 45,000! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way,&lt;em&gt; this shot was taken with an iPhone&lt;/em&gt;. Quick, someone get this guy a 12Mpx Nikon! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As some of you know, the &lt;a href="http://www.atlantaskeptics.com/"&gt;Atlanta Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; are getting ready to host &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org/AtlantaSkeptiCampFeb2009"&gt;Atlanta Skepticamp&lt;/a&gt; next year. For those of you who aren’t sure what a Skepticamp is, check out &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org/SkeptiCamp"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;.  The basic idea is that a group of skeptics get together for an ‘un-conference’ - where the participants provide the content by doing short presentations and discussions with topics about skepticism and science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still in the planning phase for Atlanta Skepticamp. If you’re interested in helping, or donating to help us out, check out the Atlanta Skeptics site for more information.   But on to today’s question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you were participating in a Skepticamp, what would your presentation be on? And, what topic would you like to hear about from others?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t know him personally, but many of my friends did. He was an asteroid specialist, and he was specifically interested in near-Earth and potentially hazardous asteroids. He was especially important in the field of active radar mapping of asteroids: using the giant Arecibo radio telescope to send pulses of energy at asteroids and using the timing of the reflections to make 3D maps, similar to how dolphins and bats echolocate. I’ve used many of his maps in my talks, including the dog-bone shaped &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/216_Kleopatra"&gt;Kleopatra&lt;/a&gt; (to show that not all asteroids look like spuds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great loss to astronomy and to science. &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001774/"&gt;Emily has more&lt;/a&gt; here, and there are other obituaries &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/news/2008/1216_Steven_J_Ostro_1946__2008.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.planetary.org/news/2008/1216_Steve_Ostro_and_the_fight_for_Arecibo.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and details of his contributions to asteroid science &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Ostro"&gt;are on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229715176757"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=927">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2fea53e79359e8db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pragmatics"/><category term="Taboo vocabulary"/><category term="Words words words"/><title type="html">Swearing and social networks</title><published>2008-12-19T19:23:50Z</published><updated>2008-12-19T19:23:50Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=927" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?cat=30"&gt;Swearing&lt;/a&gt; is risky behavior. Many of its implications are out of the speaker's control. Thus, it is advisable to know your audience well before, say, dropping the F-bomb. I think this is basically true in any setting, and I expect it to be even more powerfully felt in situations where swearing is highly transgressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/"&gt;Enron email dataset&lt;/a&gt; provides a nice chance to test out these claims. It is large (about 250,000 distinct messages, sent and received by over 11,000 distinct email addresses), and it contains a moderate amount of bad language. Not everyone swears, but a fair number of people do. The topics range widely: fantasy football, faith,  energy markets, vacation time (and of course bankruptcy and the FERC). So, with some qualifications that I'll get to, it is a useful testing ground for claims about swearing and risky verbal behavior. The following email network graph is my first stab at conducting such a test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/swear-edges-only.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/swear-edges-only-small.jpg" alt="Swearing in an Enron email network" width="475" height="636"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nodes represent 99 people with Enron email addresses who had relatively high email traffic in the dataset: at least 50 messages sent to other people in this group of 99, and at least 50 messages received from other people in this group of 99. (Messages that included &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; outsiders in their &amp;quot;To&amp;quot; lists were excluded.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A red arrow from node A to node B means that user A swore in a message to user B at least once. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;thickness&lt;/em&gt; of the arrow's line represents the amount of traffic from A to B: a thick arrow from A to B means that A sent at least 20 messages to B, and a thin arrow means A sent between 1 and 19 messages (inclusive)  to B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different line thicknesses might be hard to see at first, because the vast majority of the lines in this network are thick. I claim that this is no accident. It reflects the fact that, in this corporate setting, swearing is risky enough that it is best done only with people you know well. Your first few messages to someone are unlikely to contain swears, but you might build up the courage over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can  quantify  the visual impression that these arrows are mostly thick: just 1.6% of the possible from–to pairs in this sample set have message counts of 20 or more, whereas 78% of the from–to swearing-pairs have  message counts of 20 or more. If you squint, you can see this contrast reflected in the following version of the network, in which a gray arrow from A to B means that A swore at someone or other in the sample but sent only swear-free messages to B in this dataset. (&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This is an update/improvement; the &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/swears-noswears-small.jpg"&gt;previous visualization&lt;/a&gt; included arrows for nonswearers as well, which resulted in a mass of gray in the middle of the network. My thanks to Dougal Stanton for the suggestion in the comments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/swears-noswears-swearercentric.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/swears-noswears-swearercentric.jpg" alt="Swearing in an Enron email network" width="475" height="636"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one effect that I expected to observe but did not. Because swearing is risky, the safest situation in which to swear is one in which your hearer has already sworn with you. Thus, I expected most of the red arrows to form symmetric pairs. (See also &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=713"&gt;this post on Jamie Pennebaker's work&lt;/a&gt;.) In fact, very few red arrows run in both directions in this sample. I suspect that this is due to a major drawback (for my purposes) to the dataset: many of these relationships are hierarchical. It's one thing if  Skilling &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en-us&amp;amp;q=enron+%22Well,+thank+you+very+much,+we+appreciate+that+asshole.%22&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8"&gt;calls you or someone else an asshole&lt;/a&gt;, and quite another to use that as an invitation to do some swearing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, thanks are in order: to the people behind &lt;a href="http://csde.washington.edu/statnet/"&gt;statnet&lt;/a&gt;, the amazing R library that let me build the above networks using just simple matrices of counts, and to all the people who worked to tame the wild &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/"&gt;Enron dataset&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/~corrada/"&gt;Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/~corrada/enron/"&gt;his tools for identifying users and removing repeat messages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris Potts</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229714205487"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4824">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/00ea3e65141af0da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Comments"/><category term="Meta Stuff"/><title type="html">Everybody Panic!

&lt;p&gt;Brief bloggy news before we proceed: I’m messing around with a new thing called Facebook Connect, which allows you to log into your Facebook account and use it to post to Skepchick. It could be cool, or it could be completely useless. I’ll be working out the kinks this weekend, so feel free to try it in the meantime when you see it pop up on the blog. It may explode. You’ve been warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COMMENT O’ THE WEEK TIME!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You all responded very well to my COTW post last week, in which I called you all a bunch of no-good, lazy jerks. This week, there were loads of COTW nominations! Of course that means I had more funny posts to sort through, making judging particularly difficult. I think, though, that I chose a winner we can all agree is well-deserving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TREE LOBSTERS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tree lobsters were brought to our attention by Bug_Girl yesterday (&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4808"&gt;via a Quickies link from Amanda&lt;/a&gt;) and they quickly became extremely popular here on Skepchick. In fact, Steve DeGroof discovered a whole new side of the Tree Lobsters in &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4808&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-43527"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to see a comic called Tree Lobsters. Something along the lines of &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.qwantz.com/"&gt;Dinosaur Comics&lt;/a&gt;. Just clip art lobsters sitting in trees discussing philosophy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tree Lobster 1:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a new study that says rain causes autism.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tree Lobster 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounds like a typical post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tree Lobster 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, but you still have to account for the correlation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tree Lobster 2:&lt;/strong&gt; How about this? Let’s assume that autism is hereditary and that a lot of nerds are borderline autistic. Now, a rainy environment means that people don’t get much sun, which levels the dating playing field a bit for nerds, which in turn increases their chances of getting laid. Hell, the fact that Microsoft is headquartered in Redmond is probably enough alone to skew the data!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tree Lobster 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey, did you hear that Jenny McCarthy is lobbying to get umbrellas classified as medical devices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was amusing enough, but what really took it over the top? &lt;a href="http://treelobsters.blogspot.com/"&gt;The joke &lt;strong&gt;made real&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_XwT7oSqK2sg/SUsoklPGH-I/AAAAAAAAAA0/6OAbyfzRbsA/s400/sexvsinternet.jpg" alt="Tree Lobsters!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am officially a fan. More, Tree Lobsters, more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You may assume that Steve won this COTW, but your assumption is wrong. The Tree Lobsters win, and the prize is their continued existence. Steve loses, because he is now forced to continue producing Tree Lobster comics for our amusement.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3120228563/sizes/o/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/3120228563_f08356c15f_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It has long been speculated that as the Earth warms overall, the number and severity of large storms will increase. This makes sense, as the process that drives storms depends on water temperature; the higher the temperature of the water in the oceans, the more energy is available to drive hurricanes and other large storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, data to support this idea have been sparse. However, &lt;strong&gt;scientists have just announced they have found strong evidence to support it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco today, JPL Senior Research Scientist Hartmut Aumann outlined the results of a study based on five years of data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on NASA’s Aqua spacecraft. What they found is that very high clouds, which are associated with severe weather, are more frequent when the ocean is warmer. The correlation they found was very strong; for every degree Centigrade the oceans warm, they saw &lt;em&gt;a 45% increase&lt;/em&gt; in the number of these clouds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They observed the clouds as the seasons changed — changing the ocean surface temperatures — to get their data. They typically see 6000 such clouds a day, so it sounds like they got reasonably good statistical samples. The clouds are very high in the atmosphere, about 20 km (12 miles) or more over the Earth’s surface. In general, linking clouds, rain, and global warming is incredibly difficult because rain is very difficult to model. This new result bypasses that, using the clouds as a proxy for storms. The study is also consistent with a 2005 NASA study which found a 1.5% increase in the global rain rate over the past 18 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean? Well, it’s still not possible to say that any given season will have more or more powerful hurricanes/monsoons due to global warming, because there are so many inputs that drive the storm season. What it does indicate is that over time, over many years, the number of such storms will increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, remember, this is a &lt;em&gt;global&lt;/em&gt; result; &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; areas may still get colder — I say this specifically because I always get comments in global warming posts that some place or another is getting more snow or is colder than usual. &lt;em&gt;That’s expected&lt;/em&gt;. With global warming comes altered weather patterns, so while the Earth overall warms, some places will get wilder weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be very interesting to see the fallout from this study. Expect to hear &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/09/inhofe-debate-gw/"&gt;Inhofe&lt;/a&gt; call it a hoax, and for the usual suspects to raise a hue and a cry. For my part I’ll say that I would very much like to see more observations of this. But in general, as we get more and better data, the case for global effects gets stronger. And come January 20, I’m very much hoping to see our government take this seriously for the first time in 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's an amusing instance: &lt;a title="Daily Kos: 1001 Ways to Go To Hell in Comic Form" href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/12/18/112732/51"&gt;what happens if you tell children about Santa, and then they find out the truth&lt;/a&gt;? Why, they go on a terrorist rampage of murder and mayhem, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right. I'm sure you all remember that day when you discovered Santa Claus was just-pretend, maybe when you were 4 or 5, and you right away ran out and burned down the pre-school and strangled the cat. Funny, isn't it, how &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; reading this figured out that Santa isn't real and managed to survive the trauma without committing any felonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not this poor kid, though. Look how he ends up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="fate.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/19/fate.jpeg" width="226" height="239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what? I bet Osama bin Ladin doesn't believe in Santa Claus either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, this Chick comic has a very muddled message. It seems to be that you shouldn&amp;#39;t teach kids to believe in fairy tales, because they&amp;#39;ll be disappointed when they find out the truth…but somehow, he thinks the fairy tale of Jesus is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The astronomers took a series of images of Ganymede as it orbited Jupiter and made an 18 second/540 frame animation of it. Very cool! That’s the advantage of observing bright objects: short exposure times means you can take lots of images, and in this case there is motion, too, so a movie becomes totally cool.&lt;/p&gt;

Refer to this completed version instead. I've deleted the previous incomplete posting. Sorry about the confusion!) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A critique of the book by my personal friend, John Loftus, which explores his content, argument, and presentation in a straightforward and honest manner (and with a chance for the author himself to respond!). With John's permission, this will be the first in a series of my response to the book. Surprise, guys, this one actually contains some - *gasp* - criticisms of John's work. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the age of New Atheism, skeptics have little to combat the hard work, scholarship, and Biblical knowledge that many apologists possess. Additionally, the relatively recent uprising in skeptical equivocation of physics with philosophy, to the point where the latter topic has, at times, been declared unnecessary or even invalid, has left the New Atheist movement with nothing but a perception of a bunch of Ivory Tower scientists taking vacations on touring buses with messages on the side that are completely unfounded by the basis of their own beliefs. Although some of my fellow skeptics have presented challenging (but ultimately faulty) arguments against Christ's very existence, the new converts have adapted to this and many other old saws for the shock and awe that they perceive is inherent in those assertions against the world's most popular faith. Debates have turned into mudslinging unparalleled in the recent history of theist and nontheist dialogue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, the New Atheists are getting blown away on the debate field with their lack of knowledge and are completely giving away ground to movements outside Christianity due to the very "tolerance" they deny the Christians; the radical Muslim upsurge in Europe, and the dangers that followed, is a result of this inconsistency. Sam Harris alone amongst the New Atheists has seen this result, but even as the best author of the "Horsemen," one wonders when reading Letter to a Christian Nation why he can't approach the Bible half as effectively as even the famous polemicist Bob Ingersoll did a century before him. The other three mavericks of New Atheism don't come close to even this in their theological knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although "Why I Became An Atheist" does not deal with radical Islam or any other religion apart from Biblical Christianity and general Deism, I believe the book - despite its faults - sets a modern standard of faith evaluation "on their own grounds" that vanished when the great but Biblically illiterate Carl Sagan formed the footstool for the current nontheist movement. Overall, John's book instructs those of any worldview outside agnosticism - including, by implication, John's own atheism itself - to look at their own faiths from an outsider perspective. It not only applies to the Christian faith, but to all forms of faith, including radical Islam and other threats present in the world today. I do not presume to think it will work like a charm to defeat an institution as old as humanity itself, but if the method of the Outsider Test is passed to the moderates of other religions, critical thought and analysis might begin to appear in areas where such thinking could mean one's own death. I would like to see the Outsider Test examined and edited by John and perhaps a professional, well-known philosopher or two for consistency and validity, since it could prove a way to provoke thought in new ways within a world tending toward passivity and uncritical acceptance of any worldview (religious or not). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John's book is not without its faults. John, by his own admission, is a theologian and not a philosopher; his home library, which looks like it would belong in the home of an apologist rather than an atheist, speaks to his preference for challenging himself with theology over academic philosophy. As a result, we do not have as strong of a case against general arguments for God in comparison to John's case against Christianity or presentation of the Outsider Test; we have an overview, but nothing along the lines of a Quentin Smith or a Michael Martin. John will need to flesh these out a bit in future editions, since God's fundamental existence is in my assessment one of the most important questions men can consider, even moreso than the specific Christian claim. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, the Outsider Test, while in my opinion an effective test for general religion, suffers a logical issue - if one considers his beliefs silly looking in from the outside, that does not make those beliefs any more or less objectively true or false. In conversation, John countered that the main logical thrust would be that otherwise ignored logical contradictions in e.g. religious texts ought to be more readily apparent to the believer via his method, but as Bill Craig says in the case for contradictions in the Bible, this only proves that inerrancy is false. It does not render Christianity false. In light of this, I would like to see what John thinks of this criticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another minor faultline within the Outsider Test in its specific application to Christianity is that it literally will do nothing for Calvinist Presuppositionalists; their own argument is that the Bible itself teaches that any outsider (i.e. the reprobate) will view the religion as silly. So the Calvinist, faced with the Outsider Test, would happily agree with the method and might even claim that it in fact further *proves* their belief that God's grace is the only way one can seek God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is also plagued by numerous grammar and punctuation errors, and reads like a freshly submitted, unedited and raw manuscript that the editor sent to the presses unchecked to collect an easy paycheck. This has nothing to do with John's arguments in and of themselves, but some of the repeated passages, missed punctuation, and odd word choices (kinda like my blog writing ...) typical in a rough draft distract from the experience. The chapter on unanswered prayer comes to mind as an example of this effect. I don't know what happened with this exactly - perhaps John didn't bother with correcting his own draft in anticipation of his editor's work - but I would recommend John at the very least triple-check his book himself for these errors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book's most challenging portions, apart from John's central argument, are in John's exhaustive treatment of the Problem of Evil and with his entertaining (but far too short) section on analyzing Biblical narration ("The Strange and Superstitious World of the Bible"). John in general presents well-researched thoughts, and his references include works from both believers and nonbelievers alike. For deeper analysis of specific strong points (as well as other weak points), refer to the posts I will make in the coming weeks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been, what, a decade and a half since "The Case Against Christianity" came out? It's good to see John pick up that same torch again, right as polemical New Atheism was poised to snuff out the candle of critical thinking on those grounds for good. Although John's work needs some revision and reorganization to catch up with Christian counterpart books of the quality of Reasonable Faith (which is on its third edition now anyway, in John's defense), it is the spark that critical thinkers need to return to the proper approach of truth analysis. By no means is it a comprehensive guide, but it is a guide that at the very least approaches religion on its most fundamentally important grounds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In conclusion, despite its errors, "Why I Became an Atheist" is the best starting point for analyzing skepticism about God in general and Christianity in specific. Although John realizes his need to "flesh out" some of his thinner parts (and correct the nagging grammar errors) for a Revised Edition, the errors that are inherent in the book are, in my opinion, outweighed by John's approach, consideration of tough Christian arguments, and respect for scholarship. Over the next couple of weeks, I'll include specific criticisms and compliments for a set number of chapters in John's book, likely in three parts. I hope John and everyone else here at DC will contribute their own praises and rebuttals to John's book and to my critiques with the same ultimate dedication toward truth and consistency that most of the comments in my earlier blogs have demonstrated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to thank John in advance for what I'm sure will be some tough responses from him, but we're two guys who survived a three thousand mile road trip to the ETS despite our differences - resolving a little bit of theology is child's play to attempting to navigate Downtown Providence together. Or figuring out how to get me to pose properly for a pool shot, for that matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Darrin &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What topics in science, engineering, and medicine matter most to you? The National Academies are interested in developing useful and engaging print and web-based educational materials on the topics that you'd like to learn more about. They invite you to participate in a brief survey. &lt;a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/85927/what-matters-most-to-you-c"&gt;You can find that survey here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the 2-minute survey you'll be presented with a list of topics and asked to select the five that matter most to you. At the end, you can see how your answers compare with the results so far. And you can enter a drawing to receive a National Academies tote bag!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let the National Academies know what topics you think they should focus on so they can be sure to provide you with materials that are informative and useful.

I love it when that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s what happened to me when I read the title of this item that Jay and Evan sent me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/3705790/Scientists-develop-software-that-can-map-dreams.html"&gt;Scientists develop software that can map dreams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href="http://www.cns.atr.jp/dcn/"&gt;ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories&lt;/a&gt; in Japan are able to deduce what someone is seeing purely from brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The private institute said in a statement that…”It was the first time in the world that it was possible to visualize what people see directly from the brain activity,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief researcher Yukiyasu Kamitani  said that “By applying this technology, it may become possible to record and replay subjective images that people perceive like dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how did they do it?&lt;br&gt;
Initially they displayed to each subject 400 black &amp;amp; white control images for 12 seconds each consisting of a 10 x 10 grid of pixels. Then they used an fMRI or functional magnetic resonance imager to detect blood flow changes in the visual cortex of the test subjects for each image. This is a key step because this is what calibrates the software.&lt;br&gt;
Finally, they displayed the images to be reconstructed. In this case it was the letters N-E-U-R-O-N.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reconstructed images were black and white and lo res but they are unmistakably correct. There’s no pareidolia going on here.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/neuron2.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="283"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some articles I read state something along the lines… Brain scanning can now extract information directly from the brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is correct but it has to be interpreted very carefully….this doesn’t mean that big brother can now read your mind and find anything it wants in your biological hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine has to be calibrated to the quirks of your brain and you have to be seeing something for it to then be reconstructed. As impressive as this feat is, declaring that dream vcrs are around the corner was definitely sensationalistic. This was a proof of concept experiment. Such a refined application of this technology will definitely not be ready in time for this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget, the test subjects had to look at 400 pictures for 12 seconds each to calibrate the software to their brains. That’s 80 minutes just to get the fuzzy images above. Who knows what calibration it may take to get color moving images at a relatively high resolution. Imagine calibrating for hours or even days? It also makes sense to assume that we’ll also eventually need much higher resolution fMRIs or other imaging devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step though is obvious. Can we reconstruct what people are thinking instead of just what they’re seeing? That’s where the fun really begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the fate of people who are “&lt;a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/locked-in-syndrome"&gt;locked in&lt;/a&gt;”. They are so paralyzed that only their eyes can be voluntarily controlled. This would be a boon for these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that law enforcement and the military would love to get their hands on a device like this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think about some of the far out applications of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about even further in the future?&lt;br&gt;
ATR chief researcher Yukiyasu Kamitani says, “This technology can also be applied to senses other than vision. In the future, it may also become possible to read feelings and complicated emotional states.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true. Back when I first started blogging, I came across outrageous bits of pseudoscience such as the ones I feature periodically on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt;, and I wasn't sure quite what to do with them. Indeed, I had a hard time deciding if some of them were massive Sokal-type hoaxes or  evenif the person writing them really believed in them. Of course, I had a lot of fun taking them on. How could I not? After all, what else can one make of something like, for example, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/11/your_friday_dose_of_woo_activate_your_dn_1.php"&gt;DNA Activation&lt;/a&gt; or "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/01/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_hills_are_al.php"&gt;healing sounds&lt;/a&gt;," or even for that matter that unholy alliance of acupuncture and voodoo, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/tong_ren_an_unholy_union_of_acupuncture.php"&gt;Tong Ren&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally figured out what to make of these extravagant bits of woo. While deploring them and their potential for causing harm to the unwary (or at least to delay their seeking effective therapy), I started to appreciate the artistry, the imagination, the utter skill that it takes to produce such gems of concentrated woo. Truly, it takes an extraodinarily imaginative ability to twist logic, reason, and science into a pretzel, and then twist it just that much more. That extra "twist" is what elevates garden variety woo into YFDoW material. It is the ability to recognize that extra twist that elevates woo into art, rather than the extra twist that's just plain brain dead (and it isn't always obvious what's genius or stupid) that makes a connoisseur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a connoisseur of the finest woo, I have to tip my hat to someone who is one of the finest woo artists there is. The man is a veritable grand master of woo, a Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Rafael, and Botticelli all rolled into one. The tapestries of bizarre imagery that he can blend together to "explain" how that quackery of quackeries (homeopathy) "works" truly take my breath away, although instead of Renaissance painters, perhaps I should compare him to Pablo Picasso or Salvador Dali, given the nature of his work. You'll see what I mean in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man I am talking about is, of course, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=milgrom+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;Lionel Milgrom&lt;/a&gt;, he of "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_its_no.php"&gt;quantum homeopathy&lt;/a&gt;" and a "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/06/your_friday_dose_of_woo_the_circle_is_co_1.php"&gt;quantum gyroscopic circle&lt;/a&gt;." These two pieces of woo remain among the very finest that I have ever encountered. I am not sure that I will ever see their like again. The sheer head-scratching hilarity to be found in reading those previous efforts is beyond belief. In essence, extrapolating subatomic particles to macrospic phenomena in a manner that would make Steven Hawking's brain explode in protest were he to read Milgrom's work, Milgrom postulates a quantum coupling of homeopathic practitioner, homeopathic remedy, and patient as the mechanism by which homeopathic remedies gain their potency. That's boiling a whole lot of woo down into one sentence; you'll have to read the posts above to get the full flavor of Milgrom's quantum wackiness. Indeed, I recommend that you do that right now as a prelude to this installment of YFDoW. There's a reason, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right. Milgrom's back, and he's surpassed even himself. Be very careful before proceeding. Your fragile mind may well not be able to handle it the concentrated waves of woo that will wash over it if you continue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/your_friday_dose_of_woo_when_a_mad_mathe.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/your_friday_dose_of_woo_when_a_mad_mathe.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/489702514" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229700129169"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-4067531785675757982">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/40498f3a13537d36</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biochemistry" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Get a Job</title><published>2008-12-19T15:16:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-19T15:20:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/get-job_19.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/4067531785675757982/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=4067531785675757982" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Assistant Professor, Tenure Stream&lt;br&gt;Dept. of Cell &amp;amp; Systems Biology&lt;br&gt;University of Toronto&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Department of Cell &amp;amp; Systems Biology at the University of Toronto invites applications for a tenure track faculty position to be appointed at the Assistant Professor level in the field of Systems Biology to begin July 1, 2009.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We particularly encourage applications from candidates who have demonstrated</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229699467387"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3535">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/98a4f20234264419</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Alcohol"/><category term="supply and demand"/><title type="html">Indonesia's Drinking Problem</title><published>2008-12-22T16:39:32Z</published><updated>2008-12-22T16:39:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/3zZlQIw_tUA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/19/indonesias-drinking-problem/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In the wake of a crackdown on black-market alcohol in Indonesia, the country's sole legal alcohol importer is suddenly faced with meeting demand four times higher than what the government's import quotas allow.

&lt;p&gt;The mouseover title: "And the ten minutes striking up a conversation with that strange kid in homeroom sometimes matters more than every other part of high school combined."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perl didn't exist forty years ago, but the time that I spent messing around with the PDP-9 in Ken Stevens' lab at MIT certainly influenced the rest of my life, even though it had nothing directly to do with any classes or grades. The informal "minimum number of instructions to calculate a square root" contest had an especially big impact, even though it was way less professionally relevant than the primitive audio waveform editor that I actually succeeded in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've got a free weekend or two, you could do a lot worse than to spend some time messing around with Python and &lt;a href="http://www.nltk.org/"&gt;NLTK&lt;/a&gt; — there&amp;#39;s even an &lt;a href="http://www.nltk.org/book"&gt;online book&lt;/a&gt; to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: I note in passing that web search for "mess(ing) around with" turns up at least three classes of continuations: sex partners ("her best friend", "married women", "a guy that has a girlfriend"); technologies ("metadata", "the ASUS Eee PC", "your X Server"); and agents of potentially violent retaliation ("&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Don%27t_Mess_Around_with_Jim"&gt;Jim&lt;/a&gt;"). In contrast, plain around-free "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=%22mess%7Cmissing+with%22&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;mess(ing) with&lt;/a&gt;" seems to be much more strongly biased towards the risk-of-retaliation idea. Maybe Randall Munroe left out "around" due to label spacing issues, or maybe he just thinks of "mess with" in a more harmonious sense. Or maybe the career-success value of "messing with Perl" was in fact due to the propensity of Perl to mess right back at you. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229697114275"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=443">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a93485fc5c76f1db</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">Milgram’s Famous Studies Finally Replicated</title><published>2008-12-19T13:35:09Z</published><updated>2008-12-19T13:35:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=443" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s and 70s Stanley Milgram performed a series of now famous obedience studies. The most famous of which, experiment 5, involved a subject being asked to deliver shocks to a confederate (someone who was in on the experiment) in what they were told was a learning experiment. Surprisingly, 65% of subjects continued to deliver shocks all the way to the end, even over the increasingly vehement protests and even medical complaints of the confederate. Prior to Milgram most people, and even psychiatrists, did not predict such an outcome. Almost no one thinks they personaly would behave like the subjects in experiment 5, but apparently 65% of us are wrong. These experiments stand as a dramatic demonstration of the power of authority and other situational factors in human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milgram’s experiments, however, have been controversial. There is always, of course, controversy over exactly how to interpret social psychology experiments. Human behavior is extremely complex, and so there are always numerous variables to consider when interpreting such studies. But even more controversial than the interpretation are the ethical considerations raised by the study. Specifically, the subjects were exposed to significant short term stress during the study. Ethical guidelines since Milgram have made it impossible for anyone to replicate his studies over the last 30 years, which means there is no way to end the controversy over interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, researcher Jerry M. Burger has now published a &lt;a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/releases/amp641-2.pdf"&gt;fairly decent replication&lt;/a&gt; of the famous experiment 5, staying within current ethical guidelines. The major difference in his study design is this: In the Milgram studies, which involved increasing the voltage each time the confederate gave a wrong answer or refused to answer, most of the participants paused at the 150 volt level, which was when the confederate first gave an audible cry of pain. However, 79% of those who gave the fake 150 volt shock went all the way to the end of the experiment, giving the maximum 450 volt shock three times. Burger therefore reasoned that he could end his replication at the 150 volt shock level and that would be sufficient, and 4 out of 5 subjects who gave that shock went all the way, so their behavior could reasonably be predicted. He also put other ethical controls in place, such as screening subjects more thoroughly and rapidly briefing them on the true nature of the experiment when it was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burger found that 70% of subjects delivered the 150 volt shock, compared to 82.5% for Milgram. This difference was not statistically significant. This would appear to replicate Milgram’s findings. But of course, Burger’s protocol, which is being called “obedience lite” is not an exact replication, so I’m sure the debated will ensue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one difference in Burger’s results. Milgram found that if he modeled disobedience by exposing the subjects to another “subject” (actually a confederate) who refused to proceed, then the subject would be more likely to refuse. Burger did not find this effect, although he used different defiance modeling and so direct comparisons are difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most widely known interpretation of the Milgram experiments is that it demonstrates the effects of obedience to authority. Subjects proceeded to give more and more intense shocks at the direct prodding of an authority figure - the scientist conducting the experiment. However, there are potentially other factors as well. The gradual increase in demands makes it easier for subjects to proceed. Shocks were allegedly given in 15 volt increments. Giving smaller shocks at the beginning of the experiment may make them more accepting of the overall procedure. Also, it may seem inconsistent to refuse to give a 150 volt shock when you just gave a 135 volt shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, having limited sources of information in a novel or uncertain situation is also a factor. Other psychological experiments have shown that being uncertain in a situation can be morally paralyzing. Subjects in an unusual situation with an authority figure telling them what to do can be a powerful combination.  And finally, in the experimental situation responsibility was diffuse and not assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Burger’s experiment was not an exact replication, he argues that it is a reasonable model and allows exploration of the same psychological phenomena as Milgram studied, and this is reasonable. His findings add to the bottom line interpretation of such experiments - situational factors can have a profound effect on human behavior, and we tend to grossly underestimate the effect of situational factors, especially on ourselves. Understanding this can be a very useful insight. It may help explain events such as the abuses that took place at Abu Graib. Such insight may even help us avoid similar situations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

You were born gay, and you'll die gay, and going back into the closet &lt;i&gt;never works&lt;/i&gt;. Stop pretending, you sad sack of a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...yet is committed to his marriage for the sake of his children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Stay together for the children" also never works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Gazette of Colorado Springs reported Thursday that in the documentary, Haggard talks about a lifelong battle with his sexuality — and that he never claimed to be heterosexual.&lt;/blockquote&gt;No, he just married a chick and fathered children. You'd be an idiot to think he was straight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The reason I kept my personal struggle a secret is because I feared that my friends would reject me, abandon me and kick me out, and the church would exile and excommunicate me. And that happened and more," he says.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That's because your friends are assholes and your church is retarded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He re-emerged last month at a rural Illinois church, where he delivered guest sermons and said he was sexually abused as a second-grader.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Asshole. "I was molested, that's why I'm gay. Gay isn't natural."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He now sells insurance and, in the documentary, says he isn't successful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Cry me a river, you ignorant, intolerant shitbag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"At this stage in my life, I am a loser," he says.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, it's okay...You always were.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on some level I almost feel bad for him. Every friend he had kicked him to the curb rather than accept him for who he was, and that's totally shitty.

The description reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting gender equality and empowering women is one of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. She Is An Astronomer will promote gender equality in astronomy (and science in general), tackling bias issues by providing a web platform where information and links about gender balance and related resources are collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a pretty good idea. It’s a new group and there is already an interesting discussion going on about what it means to be equal. Personally, I think it means &lt;em&gt;equal opportunity&lt;/em&gt;. I’m no psychologist, so I don’t know if women think differently then men in general or in specifics, but even if men and women think exactly in the same way, we should strive for equal opportunity for everyone. No one gets promoted or demoted because of gender; no one gets any sort of bias for good or for ill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine the situation in real life is more complicated than this, of course. We still see a lot of attrition of women during grad school and postdoc years. There are all sorts of difficult-to-distinguish things going on there. And I know a lot of men who are very good about gender equality, and a lot who… aren’t. I still think that with time, this will become less and less of an issue, but for now it’s still a cause worth fighting for.

I later gave you &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/09/so_would_you_do_it_again.php"&gt;a personal view of primary care medicine&lt;/a&gt; and some of the challenges involved in creating an infrastructure of primary care (only 2% of American medical grads are going into primary care).  We also had &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/arrogance_is_a_distractor.php"&gt;a little chat about medical mistakes&lt;/a&gt; and medical training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what changes we ultimately make in the way we train internists, one of the lessons that residency teaches is to identify who is truly sick.  I don't mean who is faking it, I mean being able to look at someone briefly and decide whether or not they need your immediate attention.  It may seem obvious, but it's not.  Objective factors can sometimes be deceiving.  For example, an asthmatic may have perfectly normal vital signs, including a normal oxygen level, and yet be moments away from needing a breathing machine.  For an asthmatic, a normal respiratory rate may indicate fatigue rather than health,  and absence of wheezing my indicate such severe airway obstruction that wheezes aren't even possible.  The ability to recognize severe illness is one of the critical goals of residency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one area in which the so-called alternative medicine folks can really be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/what_is_an_internist_and_why_s.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/what_is_an_internist_and_why_s.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/489140262" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229639800011"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/18/majel-barrett-roddenberry-1932-2008/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aaf852399dadc831</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Majel Barrett Roddenberry, 1932 - 2008</title><published>2008-12-18T22:14:44Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T22:14:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/18/majel-barrett-roddenberry-1932-2008/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just heard that &lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_11263728?nclick_check=1"&gt;Majel Barrett Roddenberry has died&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RB:&lt;/strong&gt; I know all about this Dr. Egnor. I intend to make him Surgeon [bleeping] General when I become President in 2016!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, but who is RB, this evil incarnate who would appoint Dr. Egnor Surgeon General? You'll have to click on the link above to find out, but suffice it to say that he has perfectly helmet-headed hair and is unclear on the concept of what constitutes an illegal &lt;em&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/em&gt;. And he is definitely evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what makes me sad is that the Skeptics' Circle is going to go on a brief hiatus until January 15. The reason is simple. Two weeks from today is New Years Day. Not only is it a major holiday, but, after Christmas, it's second worst day for blog traffic of the year (at least in my experience). I realize that our intrepid and most excellent hosts don't just host because they love skepticism (although they do). They also want to have their work brought to the attention of a larger audience, and how are they going to achieve that when overall blog traffic is in the crapper on January 1? So I, your benevolent Skeptics' Circle overlord, made a unilateral decision to cancel the January 1 Skeptics' Circle, despite the pain. Besides, why would I draft some poor skeptic into working on New Years' Eve when he or she should be out partying, only to have all that work fail to reach as wide an audience as it otherwise should?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly I am a benevolent overlord. I think only of my hosts and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One beneficiary of my beneficence will be Bug Girl, who will be hosting the next Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle four weeks from now at &lt;a href="http://membracid.wordpress.com"&gt;Bug Girl's Blog&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, January 15. One other thing: Despite the prolonged break between Skeptics' Circle #102 and #103, please do not view this as an opportunity to slack off. Rather, view it as an opportunity to have extra time to help Bug Girl put together the greatest, most kick-ass &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt; ever seen! The guidelines are &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, why not make a New Years' resolution to host your very own Skeptics' Circle? &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/07/skeptics-circle-reloaded.html"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is all it takes. Well, that and passing through a skeptical gauntlet of fire run by yours truly. Actually, that "skeptical gauntlet of fire" is more like a Bic lighter. All it means is that I peruse your blog after you drop me an e-mail request to host, and if it doesn't look as though it might be Deepak Chopra, David Kirby, Dr. Egnor, or some other maven of pseudoscience trying to pass himself off as a skeptic in order to subvert the Circle, you're in. Oh, and your blog has to have at least a couple of posts on it that would be at home in a Meeting of the Skeptics' Circle. That's about it. It's a small bar to get over for the glory and fun that is hosting a Skeptics' Circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/the_102nd_meeting_of_the_skeptics_circle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/489033138" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229636947187"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/happy_monkey.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3404e57904296344</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Happy Monkey!</title><published>2008-12-18T20:56:25Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T20:56:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/489042216/happy_monkey.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/happy_monkey.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have been pondering the meaning of the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/here_we_go_again_i_get_more_em.php"&gt;new traditional greeting, &lt;i&gt;Happy Monkey!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (important usage note: it is not &lt;i&gt;Merry&lt;/i&gt; Monkey, nor is it Happy Monkey &lt;i&gt;Day&lt;/i&gt;. It is simply "Happy Monkey", full stop. Trying to change the phrase means you are waging war on the Monkey, and you know how they will respond.) I haven't. I've been bogged down in the end-of-semester grind for the last week, writing tests, giving tests, grading tests, and there has been little room in my brain for deep philosophical thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, just a few minutes ago, I reached an end. The exams and papers were all marked and graded, and I filled out the forms and submitted them to the registrar.  And I had an epiphany. Happy Monkey is not a day, not a greeting card, not just a phrase. Happy Monkey doesn&amp;#39;t come from a store. Maybe Happy Monkey…perhaps…means a little bit more. And what happened then…? Well, my small Monkey grew three sizes that day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Monkey is any moment that you feel the burdens lifted, that you feel a lightening of the mood, that you feel puckish and prankish and like kicking your heels. Happy Monkey can strike any time, any day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Happy Monkey, everyone! And may you have many Happy Monkeys in days to come!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/happy_monkey.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/489042216" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229636026919"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/18/breaking-obama-to-pick-a-physicist-for-science-advisor/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/66be9223218fee38</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Piece of mind"/><category term="Politics"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">BREAKING: Obama to pick a physicist for science advisor</title><published>2008-12-18T21:08:33Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T21:08:33Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/18/breaking-obama-to-pick-a-physicist-for-science-advisor/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;From fellow Hive Overmind blogger &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/realitybase/2008/12/18/and-obamas-science-advisor-isjohn-holdren/"&gt;Melissa Lafsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/12/sources-john-ho.html"&gt;Science magazine&lt;/a&gt; comes the news that Obama may be picking physicist John Holdren as his science advisor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll let you read those links for the details. But here’s my opinion: Awe. Some. Holdren has some pretty good credentials, including on climate change. That last bit allows me to say, with all the schadenfreude you care to assign to me, that I hope this makes global warming deniers cry into their oil stock portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It fills me to overflowing with warm fuzzies to hear all this news from Obama’s organization (well, &lt;a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/obama-tries-explain-rick-warren-0"&gt;not all of it…&lt;/a&gt;).

(Incidentally, they’re also sneaky enough to upgrade our desktops and laptops before I have a chance to clear the porn from my cache memory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to splurge on a high-def television for some time now, but when I start to shop around, it seems a new model that gives you a massage and does your taxes is always just about to become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve had my current cell phone for only about a year, but people with iPhones and all the other latest devices that recognize songs, take video, navigate the highway system, and land the space shuttle look at it like it’s a painting on a cave wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And recently, Polaroid announced it will &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/12/08/polaroid.farewell/index.html"&gt;cease production of its instant film&lt;/a&gt;this month. Sixty years after it introduced its first instant camera, the company’s iconic film will no longer be available to shutterbugs, though many photogs claim to still use it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/42/image/a/"&gt;a Hubble image&lt;/a&gt; of Jupiter and its moon Ganymede, just before the satellite dips behind the planet’s disk. It was taken in April of 2007 but just released today (which is good, because I would’ve been ticked it missed my Top Ten this year). Look at the detail you can see on Ganymede! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kills me here is the scale of this: Ganymede is about the same size as Mercury! If Jupiter weren’t there, Ganymede might be considered a planet on its own. It would be visible to the naked eye, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s science lurking here as well. As Ganymede goes behind Jupiter, we see it through more and more of the giant planet’s atmosphere. We know how Gnaymede normally looks when it’s not being obscured by Jupiter, so we can observe it as it goes behind the planet to get a measurement of the atmospheric profile of Jupiter. This is especially handy to observe Jupiter’s very high, very thin haze layer that exists way above the visible cloud tops. If you look at &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3118704696/sizes/l/"&gt;the higher-resolution picture&lt;/a&gt;, you can just see how the shadow of Jupiter on Ganymede gets redder near the shadow edge, which gives a clue about the makeup of the planet’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even without all that, I would approve of taking images like this. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere of Venus has almost no water in it at all, whereas water is everywhere on Earth. This has been a long standing mystery about out sister planet. Where did all the water go? The culprit may be the magnetic field of Venus, or, more accurately, its lack of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun spews out subatomic particles in its solar wind. When they reach the Earth, these particles are snagged by our magnetic field tens of thousands of miles above the surface of our planet, where they are slowed and trapped. But Venus has no such field, so these particles slam directly into the atmosphere. They can impart so much energy to the atoms there that they can escape the planet entirely, like shrapnel accelerated by a bullet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEM8MYSTGOF_1.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/venusexpress_water.jpg" alt="Venus Express sees water being ripped from the atmosphere of Venus."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venus is losing water from its air due to the solar wind. &lt;br&gt;Click to see a very cool animation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Venus_Express/SEM8MYSTGOF_0.html"&gt;Venus Express, an ESA probe orbiting Venus now&lt;/a&gt;, has finally detected this directly. As it rounds Venus on its elliptical orbit, it can detect particles in space around the planet. Venus Express has found that hydrogen on the day side of Venus — the side facing the Sun — is flowing out of the atmosphere. Last year the probe detected both hydrogen and oxygen coming off the night side of Venus like a comet tail, indicating water was being stripped apart and ripped out of the atmosphere. This new day side finding is important in that it gives scientists a better look at the actual mechanism at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear if this is the main process that has stripped the water from Venus over the past few billion years or not. We’re seeing the tail end of a very long series of events, and there are other factors. For example, the atmosphere of Venus is pretty different than ours; for some reason Venus’ carbon budget is all in its air, while ours is mostly locked up in sediment in the ocean floor. Venus suffered a runaway greenhouse effect, so it’s incredibly hot on the surface (400 C or about 900 F) and its atmospheric density is absurdly high. Any ocean on Venus would have boiled away long ago, putting all that water into the atmosphere, where possibly its lack of magnetic field left that water at the mercy of the solar wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Venus may be dry because of its greenhouse effect coupled with having no magnetic field (and who knows, maybe those two things are related as well). But why does Venus have no magnetic field, and we do? Venus and Earth are roughly the same size and density, so why should we enjoy a strong field, and Venus has none?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is a remaining question: why has no oxygen been seen escaping the day side of Venus? They found hydrogen, but no oxygen. If it’s the last remaining water in the atmosphere of Venus providing the hydrogen, then oxygen should be there too. If it’s not, that means we still need to figure out what’s going on over there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, all this points directly back at us. We know our planet is simultaneously stable (it’s had life on it for billions of years) as well as fragile (a lot of things have to be balanced pretty well for complex life to maintain itself). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at Venus, there but for the grace of magnetic fields go us. It’s important we understand that, and so it’s critical that we continue to study the solar system and the Universe around us. Our water and our lives may depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

This abundance of information often comes with a cost. If my grandfather wanted to learn something about his health - and of course like many men of his generation he didn't - he would have seen a doctor or read a reputable book. These days, we receive much of our information in bite-sized chunks from websites and media articles. Fast food culture applied to research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is like trying to build an igloo by catching snowflakes. We snatch little snippets of information here and there, but they lack any real substance, failing to really contribute to the building of a complete understanding of a subject. Stripped of context or reference, in the end these factlets are as intangible as the ether they travel through.&lt;/p&gt;

We are colonized by friendly bacteria that do not cause infections or harm, and in fact serve vital functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the specific topics I covered was probiotics - use of friendly bacteria species to improve the bacteria in our guts to help stave off infection or otherwise promote GI (gastrointestinal) health. Based on the evidence at the time I was luke warm on probiotics - the concept is sound, but the evidence for specific benefits is preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study, actually a &lt;a href="http://www.aafp.org/afp/20081101/1073.html"&gt;meta-analysis and review of existing studies&lt;/a&gt;, published in the American Family Physician, has altered my assessment to be more positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kligler and Cohrssen reviewed dozens of studies, and also prior reviews, such as Cochrane reviews, which are the standard for evidence-based medicine. They conclude:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are microorganisms with potential health benefits. They may be used to prevent and treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea and acute infectious diarrhea. They may also be effective in relieving symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and in treating atopic dermatitis in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In thinking about any medical treatment it is important to note that specific treatments need to be assessed as to their safety and effectiveness in treating specific conditions. It is important to avoid oversimplifications, such as “probiotics work” - work for what, and in what dose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is a natural tendency to oversimplify - it is one way to have a sense of control over our complex and often overwhelming world. Simplification, in fact, is necessary. We need to approximate reality with rules and characterizations that are mostly true most of the time. Oversimplification, however, implies that this process is taken to the extreme of being wrong. This is dangerous, or at least wasteful, when it comes to medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regard to probiotics, what this review supports is that certain doses of specific species of bacteria can help reduce the risk of developing diarrhea and the severity of diarrhea if it does develop. The concept is that friendly bacteria form a carpet lining all our mucous membranes. This carpet of bacteria keeps out any invading infectious bacteria, or at least limits its ability to multiply. When bacterial numbers ar reduced by antibiotics, this opens the door for infections from either viruses or resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking some probiotic during antibiotic use reduces the risk of infectious diarrhea. It seems that these probiotic bacteria can help replace the killed good bacteria and keep our infections. There is even a dose response effect - 10 billion colony forming units of bacteria are better than 5 billion colony forming units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the probiotics must be taking within 3 days of starting the antibiotic and the benefits are short lived. This is because the bacteria in probiotic products (like yogurt) do not seem to set up shop - they don’t form permanent self-sustaining colonies in the gut.  So they only help if you are actively taking them in large amounts while you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation of probiotics is that they contain only one or a few species of bacteria. Meanwhile, our guts contain hundreds of species forming a real ecosystem. Adding a couple of species does not have a significant benefit to the ecosytem, which will have to recover its full diversity on its own over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So probiotics are not a cure, but they can be an effective band-aid. They can help crowd out infectious organisms during antibiotic use. They also appear to be relatively safe, so there is little downside to taking them except for the expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also evidence, although of less quality according to this review, to support the use of probiotics to relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and atopic dermatitis. The evidence for these indications is more preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes the risk of oversimplification - there is already an industry of probiotic products based upon the claim that routine use of probiotics has health benefits. There is no evidence for this, however. Evidence for a short-lived benefit during antibiotic use cannot be used to support the routine use of probiotics in the healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google search on “probiotics” brings up many legitimate health advice sites that give a reasonable review of the evidence. It also brings up the websites of companies selling probiotics - and there is a clear disconnect between the evidence-based information at, say, WebMD, and the marketing hype promoting probiotic products (no surprise there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getrightprobiotics, for example, claims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patented Bio-tract technology promotes a healthy digestive tract. Reduce lactose intolerance, diarrhea, constipation, IBS, IBD, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first claim is simply a “structure-function” claim - promoting a healthy digestive tract. There is no credible evidence or scientific consensus for this claim, but in the US companies are free to make such claims without any oversight or evidence.  Evidence for lactose intolerance and IBS are preliminary and lack consensus. For diarrhea, as I discussed above, the benefits are short-lived and only during antibiotic use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But companies do not want people to use their probiotic products only for occasional short periods of time, they want them to use them every day. So that is the claim they make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the bigger problem, though, is that probiotics are regulated like supplements (which means hardly at all). Therefore it is very difficult to know how to apply the evidence to any particular product. Some information should be readily available on labels - what bacterial species are claimed to be present and it what amounts. The evidence suggests that at least 5 billion bacteria, or colony forming units (meaning live bacteria able to reproduce) are required for benefits, and 10 billion are better. But some product boast 4 billion bacteria - which sounds like a lot, even though it is a low dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also no standard quality control. Are the bacteria said to be present really in the product? How pure is the culture? Are they alive in the numbers claimed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For pharmaceuticals when a patent expires and companies are able to produce generic alternatives, they have to do studies to demonstrate equivalence to the approved brand name drug - even though they are still producing the same active ingredient, the same molecule. There is no such requirement for probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am actually supportive of the concept of probiotics. The theory is sound, it is likely a low risk intervention, and I think there is tremendous potential for the future. This latest review pushes me over the threshold of concluding that certain probiotics in sufficient doses are safe and effective for temporary prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. There are other plausible indications with some positive evidence, but more study is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the application of this scientific data is frustrated by an unregulated market for probiotics. The marketing claims being made go well beyond the evidence, emphasize continuous as opposed to as-needed use, and there is no standardization. Consumers are therefore not being well served. There is some independent analysis available, but this only looks at the content and quality of products, not health claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we need is not only better quality control for products, but effective regulation of the health claims made for these products. And this regulation should be based upon clinical studies showing efficacy of specific products for specific indications or benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, use of probiotics by consumers is a crap-shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of note, I liked Dr Austs' &lt;a href="http://draust.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/the-tragic-human-cost-of-political-idiocy-and-aids-pseudoscience/"&gt;post on the human toll of HIV/AIDS denialism&lt;/a&gt;, it is stirring.  I also found the &lt;a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/8009498/HUMBUG-eBook-by-Jef-Clark-and-Theo-Clark"&gt;Skeptic's field guide particularly interesting&lt;/a&gt;.  I would have two suggestions.  One would be to prioritize by frequency of use or rhetorical appeal rather than alphabetical, and second would be to include a section on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2007/04/conspiracy.php"&gt;conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; (like the ones the &lt;a href="http://www.layscience.net/node/430"&gt;Lay Scientist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://dubitoergo.blogspot.com/2008/12/conspiritorial-thinkings.html"&gt;Dubito Ergo Sum&lt;/a&gt; describe in this issue ), which I believe is the hallmark of all denialist arguments.  If you need a non-parsimonious conspiracy theory to explain your beliefs, well, you should re-think your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of conspiracies, I forgot to blog &lt;a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/100688"&gt;the hysterical interchange&lt;/a&gt; between Rolling Stone contributor Matt Taibbi - author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGreat-Derangement-Terrifying-Politics-Religion%2Fdp%2F038552062X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1229611476%26sr%3D8-1&amp;amp;tag=httpsciencc07-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;The Great Derangement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httpsciencc07-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;, and David Ray Griffin, 9/11 truther crank.  The whole thing is instructive in the lesson of not arguing with cranks, but it doesn't get interesting until part II when &lt;a href="http://www.alternet.org/story//101703?page=entire"&gt;Taibbi starts to figure this out for himself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As you've noticed, I struggled for quite some time with the question of how to answer your responses. Mainly this was because I was unsure of whether to treat this exercise like a comedy (because it's certainly hard to take seriously any "debate" with a person who believes that Rudy Giuliani would conspire to blow up the densest slice of taxpaying real estate in the world, the New York City financial district, in order to save his city the cost of an asbestos cleanup) or whether to aim higher and treat it like a serious political argument. I tried it both ways and neither way seemed to fit. Treating this like an absurdist comedy, I realized, I'm making it hard for readers to see how monstrous and offensive your arguments are -- but then again, when I take you seriously, spending paragraph after crazed paragraph grandstanding against you and your book, suddenly I'm the one who looks ridiculous.

&lt;p&gt;Then it hit me, and probably far too late: the correct play here is to ignore you and your arguments entirely. There are many things about your work that are outrageous and offensive, but the very worst thing about you and other 9/11 conspiracists -- and, I guess, lately anyway, me -- is that you're/we're a distraction from the real problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gets better.  Taibbi really nails the fundamental problem with all of the false-flag arguments the truthers always lay out against reality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This same public -- the same public that stood meekly by when its manufacturing economy was exported overseas, that cheered when our government pledged to "get tough" with China by demanding that it allow us to weaken our currency vis a vis the Yuan, that twiddled its thumbs when Wall Street played Keno with the nation's homeowner savings, that has consistently voted overwhelmingly to deprive itself of its right to litigate against powerful companies -- this is the public you think George Bush and Dick Cheney needed to blow up downtown Manhattan for, in order to get them on board with a war against Iraq, the Patriot Act, and whatever else.
...
All of this 9/11 Truther stuff, it's a silly distraction. A country whose economy is about to go down the shitter, to the brink of depression, thanks to three-plus decades of routinely-ignored Wall Street deregulation just can't afford to be wasting its time arguing about thermite reactions and "morphing technology." Captivated by the comic possibilities of Truther literature, I realized this too late. As you'll see below, I even spent a lot of time pulling what's left of my hair out over your answers to questions that even I admit now go beyond inane. I admit in advance to looking silly for doing so, and hereby make a promise to God that I won't do it again, at least not as long as we have other things to worry about. All the same, some of the stuff you came up with, Professor sheesh! And I thought I was loony! &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freaking awesome.  I'm sorry I didn't write about it when it came out.  His final diagnosis of Griffin's writing was beautiful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the end it all comes down to what you believe. If you believe that events in life tend to have simple explanations, then you're not going to be very impressed by Griffin's arguments. If on the other hand you think that the people running this country spend their days plotting to create phantom civilian jet-liner flights, disappearing whole fuselages full of passengers, and then shooting missiles into the Pentagon in broad daylight in order to cover up embezzlement schemes if you think, in other words, that our government is run by the same people who cook up second-rate French spy movies or your mind instantly produces the word "crossbow" when asked to produce A MURDER WEAPON by a Mad Libs script well, then, you're probably going to enjoy Griffin's books.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Ha!&lt;br&gt;

There is no evidence to support their belief, and tons of evidence against it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because they have celebrity spokespeople who are loud but appealing, and because their targets are worried parents, they have made seriously headway in society. For that reason, I consider antivaxxers to be one of if not the largest health threat in the US. We have already seen a drop in vaccinations in the US and UK and an increase in measles outbreaks due to their efforts (&lt;a href="http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20081214/NEWS01/812140349"&gt;pertussis is on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, too, though the cause is as yet unclear), and while there have been few deaths from their antiscientific crusade  so far — and even one is too many — you can bet there will be more. Many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now there&lt;em&gt; may be&lt;/em&gt; a further impact. &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026853.800-children-go-unvaccinated-as-insurers-refuse-to-pay.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;amp;nsref=online-news"&gt;It appears some insurance companies are refusing to pay for some vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear if this is due to the drop in requested vaccinations because of antivax efforts, or if rising costs and the usual insurance company reticence to provide actual coverage is to blame. &lt;a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/122/6/1319"&gt;The survey on which this article is based&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t say, but it would be an excellent idea to find out why this is happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we start to see an even higher increase in childhood diseases — and fatalities — that can be traced to the exhortations of &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/20/but-how-do-we-recover-from-jenny-mccarthy/"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/thanks_andrew_wakefield.php"&gt;Andrew Wakefield&lt;/a&gt;, then it is critically important that parents of young children know exactly what and who is behind the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229612139353"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3158169460402620603">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44efdad2699fc393</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Is Bill O’Reilly Really this Stupid?</title><published>2008-12-18T14:41:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T14:53:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/is-bill-oreilly-really-this-stupid.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3158169460402620603/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3158169460402620603" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Don&amp;#39;t answer that.

I frequently make jokes about the thermonuclearly burning stupid that regularly emanates from such "luminaries" of the antivaccine movement as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;amp;client=pub-5976931228913298&amp;amp;cof=FORID%3A1%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%3BCX%3AScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fchannel%2Fimg%2Flogo_science-blogs.gif%3BLH%3A66%3BLP%3A1%3BVLC%3A%23551a8b%3BGFNT%3A%23666666%3BDIV%3A%23cccccc%3B&amp;amp;adkw=AELymgXpNxGZd7pjrbjbuuSJQo7QY9e6iPlRE4tw3_QDlbr1Oekhak2TtGLqBa_BKW84aIR3joAalMxA806p-Nn7z3UFMnxg1SggAoT7t9AOq2zpz5e__Slaq4dBQXUYSMt3-dF-UETa1XedZ60qi3lAPJNtxJP5w5EN5graGRt_3aaEgTCDJrBFkIi_VqRXBIqUO_dHJ5n_nL8_G_o2Ehn9ACBu0ix0RA&amp;amp;q=Jenny+McCarthy+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0"&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=David+Kirby+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;David Kirby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=Dan+Olmsted+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;Dan Olmsted&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/custom?hl=en&amp;amp;client=pub-5976931228913298&amp;amp;cof=FORID%3A1%3BAH%3Aleft%3BS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%3BCX%3AScienceBlogs%252Ecom%2520Search%2520Engine%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Fchannel%2Fimg%2Flogo_science-blogs.gif%3BLH%3A66%3BLP%3A1%3BVLC%3A%23551a8b%3BGFNT%3A%23666666%3BDIV%3A%23cccccc%3B&amp;amp;adkw=AELymgXpNxGZd7pjrbjbuuSJQo7QY9e6iPlRE4tw3_QDlbr1Oekhak2TtGLqBa_BKW84aIR3joAalMxA806p-Nn7z3UFMnxg1SggAoT7t9AOq2zpz5e__Slaq4dBQXUYSMt3-dF-UETa1XedZ60qi3lAPJNtxJP5w5EN5graGRt_3aaEgTCDJrBFkIi_VqRXBIqUO_dHJ5n_nL8_G_o2Ehn9ACBu0ix0RA&amp;amp;q=Handley+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0"&gt;J. B. Handley&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/medicine/antivaccination_lunacy/"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;. It's not an exaggeration. Under the relentless assault against science and intellect by such neuron-apoptosing black holes of idiotic pseudoscience, even Orac's circuits need the occasional respite. Fortunately, around the time a respite was required, news on the antivaccine front went pretty quiet. Whether it's a pre-Christmas lull or just a regression to the mean (if you know what I mean), there just isn't much happening right now--certainly not much that's motivated me to write about it--which, by the way, is a very good thing indeed. When I feel compelled to write about this topic often, it's usually an indication that the antivaccine brigade is at work endangering public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, morbid curiosity guarantees that, even when things have been as blissfully quiet as they've been for the last two or three weeks, sooner or later I can't resist taking a peak over at that repository of antivaccination lunacy, that  the &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Age of Autism&lt;/a&gt;. I know, I know. You probably wonder why I subject myself to the concentrated, intelligence-sapping &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=moronicity"&gt;moronicity&lt;/a&gt; on a semi-regular basis. Sometimes I wonder myself, actually. Surely it can't be good for my critical thinking skills. Consider it the price I pay for combatting this nonsense. I pay it willingly--well, most of the time anyway. Also, it's rather like a slow motion train wreck. Being human, I can't resist looking; eventually my willpower wanes, be it from lack of sleep, one beer too many, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was that last night when I checked back in with our friends at AoA. I don't know why.  A whim took me and I did it. In any case, I found J. B. Handley, Founder of Generation Rescue (who's now seemingly relegated to second banana status in his own organization since it became "&lt;a href="http://www.generationrescue.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenny McCarthy's Autism Organization&lt;/a&gt;"), demonstrating his mad skilz at winning friends and influencing people in the media, specifically Donald McNeil, a reporter for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. Mr. McNeil apparently had the misfortune of doing a phone interview with him, which J. B. described in a post he so characteristically entitled &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/some-new-york-t.html"&gt;Some New York Times Reporters are Just Ignorant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow I don't think our friend J.B.'s been reading much Dale Carnegie lately, although I can understand why Mr. McNeil may have wanted to interview him. As a &lt;a href="http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=109"&gt;blog acquaintance&lt;/a&gt; put it, "A Handley quote is to a dull public health story what an overturned semi-tractor trailer is to a monotonous road trip." And Handley probably didn't disappoint, if his account (below) is any indication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/winning_friends_and_influencing_people_o_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/488680993" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229608563024"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10900970.post-6758519901478876633">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/4d71e3bba99accaa</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">102, Baby...102</title><published>2008-12-18T03:27:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T03:27:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/2008/12/102-baby102.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://mikesweeklyskepticrant.blogspot.com/" type="html">Yes, I know, I've been quite slack in my writing of late, but it's because it's coming up to the holidays which means two things:  I'm really busy and I'm very sick.

Not any used vehicle mind you.  I have a very specific one in mind.  This one is vintage early-80’s and probably has hundreds of thousands of miles on its odometer.  It needs a huge safety check and overhaul and I probably won’t ever be able to drive it.  All that for the very low price of $36 million dollars, plus $6 million shipping and handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA today has released a RFI (Request for Information) to various educational institutions, museums and organizations to gauge their interest in a slightly used space orbiter. NASA has 3 of these that its willing to part with after the Space Shuttle Program’s retirement in 2010 or shortly thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RFI states that it is an attempt at “identifying whether potential recipient organizations are capable of bearing the full cost of Space Shuttle Orbiter safing and final display preparation, SSME assembly and final display preparation, and transportation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of decontaminating each Orbiter, making it safe for public display, and transporting it to its final destination is estimated at approximately $42 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This $42 million estimate includes a $6 million cost to air ferry the Orbiter by Shuttle Carrier Aircraft from the Kennedy Space Center to a U. S. destination airport. This early estimate is based on specific assumptions by NASA about the minimum tasks which must be performed for public display of a Space Shuttle Orbiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course “the estimate is subject to change”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you don’t know what to buy an amateur astronomer, science geek, or me.  Consider a space orbiter from NASA.  It’s bound to be the next tickle-me Elmo.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mike Lacelle</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229600425107"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-488262047686109051.post-599476838759313249">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6cfc8149f3a5df8d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Festive fun from the BMJ</title><published>2008-12-18T09:51:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T09:51:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/festive-fun-from-bmj.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (teekblog)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://teekblog.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">consider, evaluate, act</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://teekblog.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229584641511"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/here_we_go_again_i_get_more_em.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ef8db4621a84a608</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">Here we go again — I get more email</title><published>2008-12-18T06:02:54Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T06:02:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/488391502/here_we_go_again_i_get_more_em.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/here_we_go_again_i_get_more_em.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some online news organization has revivified the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/11/shame_on_the_cincinnati_zoo.php"&gt;Cincinnati Zoo/Creation "museum"&lt;/a&gt; controversy, and they have &lt;a href="http://www.onenewsnow.com/Business/Default.aspx?id=355980"&gt;blamed me for it all&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you, thank you, I appreciate the credit, but really, it must be shared with the thousands of people who responded with their letters, and particularly with the zoo administrators, who so quickly saw the folly of forming an affiliation with an anti-science/anti-education organization like &lt;i&gt;Answers in Genesis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Mark Looy of the Creation &amp;quot;museum&amp;quot; generously credited me by name as the ringlea…um, criminal mastermi…uh, &lt;i&gt;instigator&lt;/i&gt; of the campaign to separate science from irrationality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I think so much pressure came on the zoo -- not only by local residents, but [from] all over the country, including an email campaign instigated by a professor in Minnesota, several hundred miles away,"&lt;/span&gt; notes Looy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;"He got many of his colleagues to send very angry emails and made some nasty phone calls to the zoo -- so much so that the guest relations people at the zoo were just overwhelmed with how to deal with this."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
According to The Associated Press, University of Minnesota-Morris biology professor P.Z. Myers urged readers of his blog to contact the zoo. In an email to the news service, he expressed his pleasure that the zoo moved so quickly and stated that someone in the zoo's marketing department &lt;span&gt;"lost sight of the educational mission of the institution while trying to make money."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what this means. It means a new flood of angry emails from aggravated creationists. I guess the site where this was posted gets a lot of right-wing traffic, because the loons are calling. I&amp;#39;ve tossed a few of these letters below the fold — have fun. It&amp;#39;s the weirdest thing, too — the majority of them are actually written in Comic Sans. You didn&amp;#39;t think I picked that font for posting ridiculous comments on accident, did you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/here_we_go_again_i_get_more_em.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/here_we_go_again_i_get_more_em.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/488391502" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229582383116"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-4973690507473162300">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb6650da1a7e2568</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Christ" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Christmas" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">What Child is This?</title><published>2008-12-18T04:22:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-21T16:35:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/488158332/what-child-is-this.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/4973690507473162300/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=4973690507473162300" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/what-child-is-this.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">We can probably agree we don’t like the commercialism of Christmas, the stress, or the holiday angst.  Yet at the center of it all there is a powerful image that speaks to all of us – the Child.  It’s fascinating to me that once a year so many people stop everything, or at least pause, to acknowledge a Child. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But who is this Child of Christmas and why does the image have such power?  We have religious and secular interpretations, and  I would like to suggest a third – a soulful interpretation.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Christians, this is a specific Child, the baby Jesus, entering the world to be its savior.  This is why the angels sing and the wise men visit.  God has at last fulfilled his promise, and there is rejoicing.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For other people, not Christian, the Christ Child still represents hope and renewal.  As with the solstice and the new year, the Child symbolizes the promise of new life and light.  Our world is so weary with struggles, we all need the healing force of hope.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have these religious and secular interpretations, and I would like to suggest a third – a soulful interpretation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Child archetype connects to each of us in a personal way as well.  We were all children once and we can perhaps remember the innocence and freedom.   It’s good to ask ourselves whether we still know how to laugh and enjoy life.   The image of a baby instinctively raises questions, and brings up feelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the deepest level, the Child connects to matters of the soul, which is &lt;em&gt;the essence of how we actually experience being alive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When new parents talk about holding a newborn, they talk of a “miracle” with overwhelming feelings.  Anyone can have these feelings about a baby, and there is a tug on something deep within.  What is that?  This is our core, our Original Child, our personal manifestation of the archetype, alive deep inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not the Christ child or just a symbol of hope.  This is the Child we all know is still present but may be lost or buried.  Our life patterns, our “personalities,” our many roles, our anxieties, our regrets, our plans, our endless thoughts, all conspire to distance us from who we once were – infants with magical capability for presence and joy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author of the paper, “The Infant as Reflection of Soul,” William Schafer, says “Babies by their very existence call us back to something we all sense we have lost.  They do not enchant us simply because they are ‘cute.’”  He says infants frequently hint that they are capable of experiences we no longer commonly enjoy – original experiences of energy, openness, and joy.  In early infancy, Schafer says, these are profoundly essential human spiritual experiences.  The pure, calm awareness of a baby is free of internal commentary, judgment, comparison, fear, or desire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interestingly, in the spiritual Balinese culture, babies are not allowed to touch the ground for the first year of life.  They are considered closer to God than adults.   In any culture, one only needs to look into an infant’s eyes to see a being that is absolutely in the present, that has no agenda whatsoever, that is open to the simple miracle of being alive.  This delight is pure and plain in a smile, a look, a wriggle of total energy.  The ego has not emerged; there is just being.  Worries about the past and concerns for the future do not exist; the moment is timeless, endless. In Schafer’s terms, infant joy of this kind is the natural, inevitable consequence of presence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In contrast, adults experience split-second judgments that erode the capacity for joy.  If we have a bad experience, we can’t wait for it to end.  If we have a good one, we want more of it and we worry that it might stop.  Either way, joy—the sense of being open and drawn to our actual experience in wonder and curiosity without fear or repulsion—is veiled.  We end up living lives in which most of our time is spent wanting to be in some other moment than the present one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if we choose, we can learn from infants.  We need to see them with new eyes and let them be our teachers.  We can let them remind us of what we have lost. Each of us is still innocent, life-loving, and capable of the soulfulness we see in infants’ eyes.  And part of the archetype of the Child is the capability of great transformation.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;So this season, let’s consider what it might mean to honor the Child – first of all in ourselves, and then in each other.  We can slow down and look around.  We can be gentle, making room for magic.  Enjoy the pattern of raindrops on the windshield while stuck in traffic or laugh at the funny ringtone on somebody’s cell phone. We can remember that we are all connected. We can allow ourselves to feel joy for no reason.  For me, I plan to cherish every chance to look into the eyes of a young Child.  I expect I will learn something I can use when I look out of my own Child eyes.  I will practice &lt;em&gt;delight&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reference: Schafer, W. (2004).

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhofe’s list of 650 scientists that supposedly dispute the consensus on AGW reminded me of another list: The Discovery Institute’s list of scientists who dissent from Darwinism, so I thought I’d compare the two lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, numbers. The Discovery Institute’s list has 751 names, while Inhofe’s has only 604. (Not “More Than 650” as he claims – there are many names appearing more than once.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, how do you get on the list? Well, you have to sign up to get on the Discovery Institute’s list, but Inhofe will add you to his list if he thinks you’re disputing the global warming consensus and he won’t take you off, even if you tell him to do so. Yes, there is someone less honest than the Discovery Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, what sort of scientists are on the lists? Well, the Discovery Institute list has a distinct shortage of biologists, while Inhofe’s is lacking in climate scientists. It does have a lot of meteorologists, but these are people who present weather forecasts on TV, not scientists who study climate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 5 ‘scientists’ who show up on both list, one of them is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Gonzalez_(astronomer)" rel="external "&gt;Guillermo Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fascinating how ignorance can be a motivator in so many different areas, from the Intelligent Design argument to the Global Warming denial, science strongly contradicts the claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have raised the question as to whether there is such a thing as Global Warming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the temperature record
&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/23/280px-Instrumental_Temperature_Record.png" alt="280px-Instrumental_Temperature_Record.png" width="280" height="208" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followed  by the CO2 concentration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2008/12/23/280px-Mauna_Loa_Carbon_Dioxide-en.svg.png" alt="280px-Mauna_Loa_Carbon_Dioxide-en.svg.png" width="280" height="180" style="text-align:center;display:block;margin:0 auto 20px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we notice? First of all the temperatures have been rising since as early as the 1970’s. We also know how CO2 concentration and temperature are related and can thus evaluate the temperature response due to CO2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By modeling the temperature response with and without the human caused forcing components one can show that most of the recent warming is indeed related to human actiity.

Handley is the media’s go-to guy for crazy quotes, or what editors like to call “balance”. By his own estimate, Handley, who founded the radical anti-vaccine group Generation Rescue, has spoken with a hundred or more reporters over the years, and his half-baked conspiracy theories and junk science rarely disappoint. A Handley quote is to a dull public health story what an overturned semi-tractor trailer is to a monotonous road trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Handley &lt;a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2008/12/some-new-york-t.html"&gt;met his match last Friday&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; senior medical reporter Donald McNeil, a 32-year vet of the Grey Lady. McNeil has reviewed plays, written about the environment, and filed stories from 49 countries. He’s also witnessed the terrible price of contagion during his travels in the Third World: AIDS, malaria, avian flu, SARS, mad cow disease and other killers. Clearly, this man has been around the block a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McNeil was writing an article about &lt;em&gt;Autism’s False Prophets&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Paul Offit’s page-turner about the phony autism cure industry and the hucksters who keep it viable, and the book’s impact on the debate over the nation’s vaccine program. He wanted a quote from Handley, who rates a mention or two in Offit’s book. We’ll let J.B. take it from here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview began…Donald McNeil was a pleasant guy from the outset, clear and straightforward in his goals. He mentioned Offit’s book, that there was certainly some controversy, and what did I think about it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my initial answer surprised him. To paraphrase myself I said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Offit’s book is a disappointment. For something like autism, where none of our health authorities have any explanation of cause or cure, we have a whole community of doctors and parents who are actually recovering children. And, without ever treating an autistic child, interviewing a DAN! doctor who treats them, or exploring the several hundred case reports of complete recovery and thousands of stories of improvement, without ever looking into any of this, Offit says its all bullshit. I just don’t understand how someone who considers themselves a doctor could do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is what I am going to tell you about Donald McNeil: he was completely and utterly clueless. He’d never heard kids actually recover. He’d never heard of cases of children, now neurotypical, with detailed medical records and case reports charting their recovery. He didn’t know tens of thousands of kids are truly recovering from autism and being treated by doctors with medical degrees just like Offit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluster and misdirection are a favorite tactics of Handley and other anti-vaccine activists, and they usually work on reporters who are new to covering autism, and imagine that yes, there could be thousands of children who have been cured of autism spectrum disorders. Somehow I don’t think McNeil was having any of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation continued. He said Offit has a simple position on our community: greedy lawyers and opportunistic doctors prey on desperate parents, and that’s all we are. What did I think of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him Vaccine Court lawyers are paid by the hour, as far as I knew, so hard to fathom they are chasing a great fortune. On the quack doctor side, I took him through my own neighborhood. Six kids with ASD at my son’s school. Three completely recovered, all from the same doctor. Doctors don’t stay in business very long without results, and I have seen some great results. Has he ever looked? Of course he hasn’t. He had no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not much of a defense. Vaccine court lawyers do indeed bill by the hour, and are paid if they win or lose, no matter how improbable their claims. Kathleen Seidel has covered their abuses well, and gives an eye-opening overview of the process &lt;a href="http://neurodiversity.com/weblog/article/142/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the quack doctor side, the overwhelming evidence, gleaned by researchers around the world over several decades, says that autism currently has no cure, and is not associated with vaccines. But J.B. Handley, the P.T. Barnum of confirmation bias, will have none of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went on to the next topic, which was probably my favorite. I took him to task on the sweeping statements he and his colleagues make that the science proves “vaccines don’t cause autism.” I took him through how every single study Offit and others cite only compare vaccinated kids to other vaccinated kids… I explained how important it is to look at unvaccinated kids, something people like Offit never advocate doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason that best and brightest vaccine researchers don’t advocate comparing vaccinated kids to unvaccinated - there aren’t enough totally unvaccinated kids in the US to get a meaningful result, and it’s not necessary.  Handley of course buys the urban myth that the Amish don’t vaccinate - his editor at the Age of Autism, Dan Olmsted, &lt;a href="http://http://autism-news-beat.com/?p=29"&gt;fabricated that story three years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none of this matters to Handley and his posse. As long as can spoonfeed “balance” to the media, Handley will be cooking up his own reality, and stewing in his own juice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>autblog</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://autism-news-beat.com/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Autism News Beat</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://autism-news-beat.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229572636989"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/awesomely_horrible.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12477eed9b5554c8</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Development"/><title type="html">Awesomely horrible</title><published>2008-12-18T03:22:31Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T03:22:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/488264568/awesomely_horrible.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/awesomely_horrible.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have a long history in developmental biology of studying the most amazing freaks of nature — damage to developing organisms can produce astonishingly ghastly results as the embryo tries to regulate and recover, yielding results that are &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; normal. There's even a whole subdiscipline of the field, teratology, dedicated to studying aberrations of embryology. The word is perfect, since it is derived from a Greek root that means both "wonders" and "monsters".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unfortunate child in Colorado was the recipient of one of these wonders/monsters. Diagnosed with a brain tumor, when &lt;a href="http://www.thedenverchannel.com/health/18297954/detail.html#-"&gt;surgeons opened up his skull, they found fragments of a fetus inside&lt;/a&gt;: two tiny feet, part of a hand, coils of intestine. The surgery was successful and the child is doing fine now, but this was the most well-organized 'tumor' I've ever heard of. It's not clear exactly what it was; there are things called teratomas, where a particular kind of cancer recapitulates a developmental program and builds tissues, things like skin with hair or teeth or chunks of muscle and bone and gland, but those aren't this well organized. They tend not to produce complete organs, but partially differentiated sheets and lumps. Another possibility is &lt;i&gt;fetus in fetu&lt;/i&gt;, where a fragment of the very early embryo is isolated and begins its own independent pattern of normal development, and then is engulfed by the larger and faster growing sibling embryo. Sometimes people late in life will be surprised to learn that there is a partially developed twin imbedded deep in their body. There is no question in any of these cases, however, that the tissue is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; an autonomous individual. It is a piece of human-derived tissue that has executed part of the program of cell:cell interactions and induction that these kinds of cells are capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something struck me when I saw the photograph of this particular surgery. Here it is, a photo of a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/17/tumor.php"&gt;fetal foot flopping out of a bloody baby's brain&lt;/a&gt; (don't click if you're squeamish). As I'm sure you've noticed, anti-choice people love to parade about with gory photos of aborted fetuses, and they love to dwell on little details like a recognizable hand or face. This picture is exactly like those, yet realize this: there was no human being behind those little baby toes. The existence of these fragments of non-sentient tissue endangered the life of a child, and there was no question that they needed to be extracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also how we should view abortion. It's ugly and messy, and there's something disquietingly resonant of humanity in the pieces of the embryo or fetus, but we shouldn't be fooled. Those are beautifully patterned collections of differentiated cells, but there is no person there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/awesomely_horrible.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/488264568" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229569907230"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4805">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/3a4e89dba65f1d69</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">I’m Back… and I’m in Falwell, Inc.</title><published>2008-12-18T03:07:31Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T03:07:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4805" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4d1086e1efc1536a93f07c24cc1f272b&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize for my long absence from Skepchick. After some nagging from Rebecca at a recent Skepchick get-together in Boston, I’ve decided to start blogging again on a regular basis! Now that I’ve survived MIT Differential Equations and my PhD qualifying exam, I really don’t have much of an excuse anymore. So, in the coming months you can look forward to many geological tidbits, tirades, and tantalizations as well as some musings on life, the universe, &amp;amp; everything. There will also be some boring descriptions of the daily life of a graduate student and some less-boring descriptions of the fieldwork I will be doing as part of my graduate studies. I will be heading to Oman (near Saudi Arabia) for a month in January to do mapping and collect samples for my PhD thesis, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you’re probably wondering about the somewhat strange title of this post. It’s true: I am back, and I am also in the 2008 book by Dirk Smillie titled &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Falwell-Inc-Religious-Political-Educational/dp/0312376294"&gt;Falwell, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;. That’s right: &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=z9Jld9a4olgC&amp;amp;pg=PA179&amp;amp;lpg=PA179&amp;amp;dq=evelyn+mervine+falwell,+inc&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=7hb38Nrd7q&amp;amp;sig=ek4yBf7RL0XdGE1bvtx76-feD3o&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;I am quoted on pages 179-180 of this book&lt;/a&gt;. I was completely unaware of my quotation in this book until &lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through"&gt; I was googling myself randomly &lt;/span&gt; I was looking for an important reference earlier this evening. Apparently, Smillie was also using google when searching for information for his book. The quotation that he used was from a Skepchick post I made in February 2007 titled &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=396"&gt;Young Earth Creationists are NOT Geologists&lt;/a&gt;, a post in which I ranted about how much I dislike Dr. Marcus Ross, a professor of geology at Liberty University, a conservative Christian college founded by Jerry Falwell. Dr. Ross is a young Earth creationist who believes the Earth is only 6,000 years old. My quotation was included as evidence that “geology students at other universities have it in for Ross, too.” Prior to my quotation, Smillie discusses how some geologists at Rhode Island University (Dr. Ross’s alma mater) believe that his diploma should be revoked, “one even suggested he be stoned to death with tribolytes.” I heartily agree (though I’d recommend &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite"&gt;trilobites&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure what a tribolyte is), and I’m honored that I was included as a skeptical voice in Smillie’s book. I am actually very impressed at how Smillie used my quotation in his book. He edited the blog post nicely, taking a sensible snapshot of my words without losing any of the meaning. If anything, he made my disorderly rantings more organized and straightforward. I have yet to read the entire book (though I guess now I’ll be ordering a copy!), but so far I’m pleasantly surprised by Smillie’s neutral tone. And happy that the Skepchick blog is actually read and has made it into print! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, Dr. Ross is now aware of my post as well. His defense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Earning a PhD does not mean believing in everything it stands for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, earning a PhD in geology isn’t about belief at all. Scientists don’t “believe” that the Earth is millions of year old. Instead, they use evidence (isotopes, cooling models, rates of various processes) to place reasonable bounds on the age of the Earth and work to refine their knowledge. However, there is excellent evidence (with appropriate error bars) that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incredible that people feel personally attacked by my mere existence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I’m not personally attacked by your mere existence. Shocked by it, yes. Willing to defend geology and science, yes. Wondering if Liberty College also teaches that the sun revolves around the Earth and that there are four elements (Earth, Wind, Water, and Fire), yes. But I’m not too worried about your existence as a geology teacher at Liberty. Just don’t apply for a job here at MIT or Woods Hole anytime soon– because, trust me, you are definitely not qualified for the position. Even if you do have a PhD in geological belief.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evelyn</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229563807198"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=923">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0d6a7718c1c7a3b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><title type="html">UK linguistics Research Assessment Exercise results: hard to be humble</title><published>2008-12-18T01:12:11Z</published><updated>2008-12-18T01:12:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=923" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone who's anyone in British higher education knows that today at one minute past midnight the results of the latest Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) were released.  And as I believe I have occasionally mentioned here, in the small part of my life that is not devoted to Language Log, I moonlight as Head of Linguistics and English Language (known as LEL) at the University of Edinburgh.  So you'll naturally want to know how well we did in the RAE.  That's why I'm still up after midnight (Greenwich Mean Time).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you can easily check the published details for yourself now, at &lt;a href="http://submissions.rae.ac.uk/results/qualityProfile.aspx?id=58&amp;amp;type=uoa"&gt;the relevant RAE results web page&lt;/a&gt;, as soon as their server stops crashing (it was a bit over-excited just after midnight).  So it would be silly for me to let my natural innate modesty hold me back.  The truth is out there: LEL ranks absolute highest in the UK for the proportion of its work falling in the 4* "world-leading" category.  And not only that, but its numbers are so strong that if you compute a sort of absolute volume of world-leading-research by multiplying the number of Edinburgh linguists considered in the exercise (36) by the percentage of their work that was considered world-leading (30%), you get a number (&lt;b&gt;10.8&lt;/b&gt;) that cannot be matched even by adding together the figures for any two other departments of linguistics in the United Kingdom.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The closest approach would be by adding Lancaster's 6.34 to Newcastle's 4.27, to get &lt;b&gt;10.6&lt;/b&gt;.  For any two other departments you get less. Adding three or four departments together generally yields less: for example, adding together Cambridge (10 * 20% = 2) and Oxford (16.5 * 10% = 1.65) and University College London (14.5 * 20% = 2.9) and York (13 * 20% = 2.6) would yield only &lt;b&gt;9.15&lt;/b&gt; for the four programs combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the published figures, LEL at Edinburgh actually contributes about 22% of the entire output of 4*-quality research work done in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what my colleagues here have built here (for I am just a relatively recent arrival) is not just a program that is top of the league table, but one that is stunningly good.  Really, I'm a naturally shy and retiring guy (you know that), but facts must be faced.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way the RAE worked involved a national panel which put out a call to all UK universities to pick out for each department or subject area those of their academic staff who were judged to be productive in research, and to submit four publications by each of those, plus various other data.  In each subject a national panel worked for a year or so reading and grading everything submitted.  They mixed in a score for the research environment and a small percentage for esteem indicators like major prizes and awards, and then presented the results as a vector of five integers: first, a rounded percentage corresponding to work of a quality that leads the world in originality, significance, and rigour (4*); then another corresponding to quality of international excellence but not at the very highest level (3*); another corresponding to internationally recognized quality (2*); another corresponding to nationally but perhaps not internationally recognized quality (1*); and a fifth corresponding to work falling below nationally recognized standards for research work (Unclassified).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEL at Edinburgh entered &lt;b&gt;everyone&lt;/b&gt; on the permanent staff as research productive (departments were allowed to simply leave some people out of the accounting, lowering the number of people submitted but raising the average quality, but we didn't do that), and submitted four selected publications by each person.  And the result, after we had spent just over a year on tenterhooks, was this vector:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table border="" cellpadding="6"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;4*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;3*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;2*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;1*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;U&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;30%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;30%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;30%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEL at Edinburgh was the only linguistics program to reach 30 in the 4* category.  And, with its 36 productive linguists, it is also in absolute terms (by count of academic staff members entered on the return) the largest linguistics program in the country.  Perhaps the most amazing thing is that this is only part of the story about Edinburgh. Next door to us is the astonishing &lt;a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mfourman/blogs/news/2008/12/rae-2008-results-informatics-and.html"&gt;School of Informatics&lt;/a&gt;, where there are so many computational linguists and other language and speech researchers that they would be very highly ranked in their own right if they decided to call themselves a linguistics department.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should be the advice given to an ambitious student who is considering the possibility of studying linguistics in the United Kingdom, either at undergraduate or postgraduate level?  It is going to be hard for us to be humble.  We will try, of course: my colleagues here come from a variety of different countries around the world, but many are British, and thus very modest and self-effacing despite their brilliance. But with these figures out, even these shy people will have to admit, if pressed, that if you want to study in the biggest language sciences community in the U.K., and the best one as judged by volume of work judged to be of world-leading quality, it looks like you should make plans to head for Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

Southern Baptist Universities&lt;/em&gt; as well. This action by the &lt;em&gt;Convention&lt;/em&gt; is made even more infamous by the fact that one of my undergraduate schools, &lt;em&gt;Southern Wesleyan University&lt;/em&gt;, just placed a woman as dean over their departments of Bible and Christian studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is truly a sad time, especially here at Christmas, as I read in the November 12 edition of the New Letter the prayer request: &lt;strong&gt;The Living Christmas Tree Pray for all who will present the true meaning of Christmas and all who will hear the good news of God’s love.&lt;/strong&gt; That women, simply because of their gender, are eternally viewed as &lt;span&gt;un&lt;/span&gt;-forgiven in this respect and are made to pay for this in the &lt;em&gt;Southern Baptist Convention&lt;/em&gt; based on the Apostles Paul’s miss-understanding of the Genesis 3 account as he expresses it in I Corinthians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In closing, I sadly find it very hypocritical and counterproductive for the largest evangelical denomination in the U.S., the &lt;em&gt;Southern Baptist Convention&lt;/em&gt;, to proclaim God’s perfect love in His Son Jesus Christ open to all who will accept it only to attack and fire women under the same evangelical banner for no other reason other than their God given gender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for your time and may you enjoy find the true love and forgiveness that makes this time of the year so special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;Harry H. McCall&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pastor’s Reply:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harry,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Always good to hear from you. Thank you for your kind feedback on the Tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have a keen eye for hypocrisy and a strong desire to name it when you see it. I affirm you in that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First Baptist Church is not on a crusade against women. We voluntarily cooperate with the Southern Baptist Convention, not because it is perfect or that we agree with every policy or practice, but because we do support the opportunity to cooperate in work that no church can do alone. No family is perfect, but we find ways to love each other and work together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I teach at North &lt;span&gt;Greenville&lt;/span&gt; University and Anderson University from time to time. I know that women serve in very responsible positions at both schools, but I do find it interesting that none teach in the religion department. Since I'm not involved in hiring, I don't know if this is coincidence or merely a result of who has applied. I do know that my wife has been my guest lecturer in the class I teach in pastoral care. She has been well-received by the school and my students. My focus has been to make the most of the opportunities these schools have gracious offered me by teaching with integrity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish that I had seen you face to face at the Tree. Please pass on to your family my wishes for a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pastor First Baptist&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one truly needs a Biblical God (or any god for that matter) to be ethical and moral, then how was I (as an atheist) able to address this issue with this conservative Baptist church which believes the Bible, especially the New Testament, to be the Word of God while I don't?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secondly&lt;/em&gt;, as an employee of the state of South Carolina, how does the secular state create its internal employee policies based on an ever changing modern secular society and come up with conduct rules such as their &lt;em&gt;Workplace Violence Policy&lt;/em&gt; and their &lt;em&gt;Sexual Harassment Policy&lt;/em&gt; without God or the Bible?  In fact, both policies are not drawn form the Bible, but often run counter to the Biblical codes of morals and ethics? (An example is Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelation retuning to slaughter the evil forces; a &lt;span&gt;retaliation&lt;/span&gt; act which would get one fired with the state!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If what Dr. Craig &lt;span&gt;Blomberg&lt;/span&gt; claims as divine guiding principle for modern humanity’s morals and ethics is true, then just how did our secular society outlaw slavery and the subornation of women which are both God directed Biblical principles and which the Bible believing &lt;em&gt;Southern Baptist Convention &lt;/em&gt;still use to fire womenand deny their employment?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, I noticed under &lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;WikipediA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that Dr. &lt;span&gt;Blomberg&lt;/span&gt; “…&lt;em&gt;has often been critical of American evangelical scholarship, and he controversially fostered a dialogue with Mormon professor Stephen E. Robinson of &lt;span&gt;BYU&lt;/span&gt;, which resulted in the book How Wide the Divide? An Evangelical and a Mormon in Conversation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally have had dealings with Professor Stephen Robinson of the &lt;em&gt;Department of Ancient Scripture at Brigham Young University&lt;/em&gt;.  Although Robinson earned his PhD under James H. &lt;span&gt;Charlesworth&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Duke University&lt;/em&gt; (now of &lt;em&gt;Princeton&lt;/em&gt;), I found that, for a &lt;em&gt;Temple Mormon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Christian educator&lt;/em&gt;, Stephen Robinson was a knowingly deceitful liar when I called him to ask for an explanation to a Greek exegetical problem based on the United Bible Society Greek New Testament 4&lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; ed. dealing with the &lt;em&gt;Gospel of Matthew&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Book of Mormon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If what Dr. &lt;span&gt;Blomberg&lt;/span&gt; claims is true about the need for God, then, in my next post on the &lt;span&gt;LDS&lt;/span&gt; Mormon Church and Professor Stephen Robinson, I would like to hear how his Christian dialogue with this &lt;span&gt;BYU&lt;/span&gt; professor is justified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

None other than the &lt;a title="Warren To Deliver Invocation at Inaguration | Right Wing Watch" href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/warren-deliver-invocation-inaguration"&gt;smilin' face of right-wing fundamentalism, Rick Warren&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we've pointed out several times before, in 2004 Warren declared that marriage, reproductive choice, and stem cell research were "non-negotiable" issues for Christian voters and has admitted that the main difference between himself and James Dobson is a matter of tone. He criticized Obama's answers at the Faith Forum he hosted before the election and vowed to continue to pressure him to change his views on the issue of reproductive choice. He came out strongly in support of Prop 8, saying "there is no need to change the universal, historical defintion of marriage to appease 2 percent of our population ... This is not a political issue -- it is a moral issue that God has spoken clearly about." He's declared that those who do not believe in God should not be allowed to hold public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama had a chance to set a non-sectarian, progressive tone at this event, and he has chosen to kow-tow to the wretched evangelical movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/same_as_the_old_boss.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/487958906" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229545800716"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=922">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28b724db67e888d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Of shoes, waffles, pants, shorts, tanks, and voices</title><published>2008-12-17T20:15:36Z</published><updated>2008-12-17T20:15:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=922" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of Woody Allen's "Slang Origins" (chapter 18 of his 1975 collection &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Without-Feathers-Woody-Allen/dp/0394497430/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Without Feathers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), John Kenney has written a hilarious op-ed piece for &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; ("&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/opinion/17kenney.html"&gt;The Shoe Heard Around the World&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, published Dec. 16, 2008), which is of course — obliquely but not quite so — about &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uIj0YvDBKE"&gt;the shoes thrown at George W.

&lt;p&gt;I just read Dr. Pepperberg’s book, Alex &amp;amp; Me, and it’s an interesting read, from the POV of an animal lover, a scientist, and/or a skeptic.  But scrutiny of her methods and accomplishments aside, she brought up an interesting topic: the possibility that we may “know” certain things that can’t be proven with science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she was able to demonstrate with some level of scientific merit the ability of Alex to identify shapes, colors, materials, same vs. different, and the concept of “zero”, she also witnessed in him a higher level of consciousness, that was too spontaneous to replicate with trials.  For example, he refused to call an apple an apple, preferring instead to call it a “banerry”, which she interpreted to be a neologism of banana and cherry, due to the apple’s round red appearance, and soft yellow pulp.  She also witnessed in him the emotions of guilt, sadness, and intimacy toward her, and rivalry (almost bullying) between he and the baby parrot, Griffin.  Over-interpretation by Dr. Pepperberg, or valid conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-parrot-related examples of things we may just “know” might include…love, right &amp;amp; wrong (basic morality), good, evil, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

The dialog is hilariously stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/9y17pyVzHhM%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billo blows it early, claiming that Christmas marks &lt;span&gt;"the birth of Jesus Christ, which is what the holiday is based on"&lt;/span&gt;, which is simply not true. Midwinter festivals have a long history predating Christianity, and Christianity simply coopted this one, right down to the date and many of the pagan traditions that go with it. The &lt;i&gt;name&lt;/i&gt; is taken from Christianity, but so what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the two begin a duet of historical revisionism. Carlson is upset because public spaces contain a multitude of different displays, and she complains that her children won't be able to see &lt;span&gt;"the thing I was able to see growing up"&lt;/span&gt;, which seems to be a complete lack of diversity — the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; displays she remembers seeing as a child were entirely Christian, and to her this is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billo claims &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;there was no controversy over Christmas … everybody said Merry Christmas&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, again as if this were a good thing, and completely ignoring that this controversy is one he invented. Yes, people said &amp;quot;Merry Christmas&amp;quot;, and they also said &amp;quot;Happy Holidays&amp;quot;…and we still do. Even atheists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Carlson's next suggestion, made while completely oblivious to what she is saying: &lt;span&gt;"People can have their right to free speech, just don't pick December 25th to do it"&lt;/span&gt;. Right. You can speak freely, except on 25 December, and, ummm, the days around Christmas, which nowadays spans the period from shortly before Halloween to sometime around New Year&amp;#39;s Day. And Easter is off limits, too. And St Crispin&amp;#39;s Day. And Shrove Tuesday. And Pentecost Sunday. Oh, and the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, OK — you get 3 hours of free speech on the second Tuesday in July, at 2am, as long as you don&amp;#39;t say it anywhere outside of your house. And only if you have a house — no poor people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billo makes a prediction: &lt;span&gt;&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re going to try to revoke the federal holiday … you can&amp;#39;t have a federal holiday based on religion&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;. The first part is wrong, the second part is right. You can't have the state endorsing a religious holiday. However, atheists aren't at all interested in revoking our midwinter holiday, and I haven't heard of anyone lobbying to get the day off the calendar. We also have a clear-cut court decision from the federal judicial system, &lt;a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/decisions/holydays/bldec_GanulinUS.htm"&gt;Ganulin v. United States&lt;/a&gt;. O'Reilly is going to be pained to learn this, but legally, he isn't getting Christmas off because he's a Christian. It's a &lt;i&gt;secular&lt;/i&gt; holiday in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courts have repeatedly recognized that the Christmas holiday has become largely secularized. …By giving federal employees a paid vacation day on Christmas, the government is doing no more than recognizing the cultural significance of the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/jingo_bells.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/487813661" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229533753539"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3527">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4e823e078239cdf</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="restaurants"/><category term="travel"/><title type="html">From a London Bathroom Wall, A Lesson in Complementaries</title><published>2008-12-17T16:48:11Z</published><updated>2008-12-17T16:48:11Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/TBH83jSDBFY/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/from-a-london-bathroom-wall-a-lesson-in-complementaries/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Am on holiday with the family in London.

In parts of northern Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and other states, scientists have found no acorns whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the seemingly low acorn output has some people worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate McNamee, who runs a Washington-area, volunteer tree-planting project called “Growing Native,” says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year we collected 25,000 pounds of seeds, most from a bumper crop of acorns,” said McNamee. “This year we only collected 10,000 pounds, and 90 percent of that was walnuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scientists point to various natural phenomena to explain the lack of acorns found this year. But others point to the number of happy and enormously fat squirrels waddling around as the cause.&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sq4-276x300.jpg" alt="sq4" width="276" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the AMA, instances of obesity in squirrels has risen sharply in the last month, causing some to speculate that squirrels are really ramping up on acorn collection and consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, squirrels are remaining tight-lipped about their involvement. When asked if he knew anything about the acorn shortage, one obese squirrel simply put a finger to his lips and winked. He then belched, and rolled over on his side and fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, to combat the rise in overweight squirrels, doctors are urging habitrails and hamster exercise wheels all over the country to offer reduced rates to those squirrels that can barely climb their own trees anymore. And area church congregations are praying for a very long winter, which would allow the furry little guys time to burn off all the extra pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another odd turn of events, several squirrels in Central Park West were seen constructing elaborate security systems around their upscale squirrel holes, while many squirrels in West Virginia were seen sitting in lawn chairs in front of their double-wide squirrel holes with shotguns in their laps, leading many to speculate that the squirrels had a little something extra to protect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When interviewed, one Miami squirrel said cryptically, “First you get dee nuts. Den you get dee power. Den you get dee women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then disappeared into his squirrel hole. &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sg.jpg" alt="sg" width="183" height="183"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, groups of &lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; readers became giddy thinking about all the jokes they were going to make in the &lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt; about “squirrel holes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still unknown if any of the unusual squirrel behavior has anything to do with the acorn shortage. Some people speculate that squirrels are only part of the problem. They say the recent chestnut shipments seized by pirates in the Straits of Somalia has lead chestnut roasters to improvise and use other available nuts, thereby helping to deplete the acorn reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skepchick&lt;/em&gt; was unable to get a single chestnut roaster to comment on the allegations, so this charge has yet to be confirmed. But it’s probably a good idea to be cautious of your nuts this holiday season. It just makes good nut sense.&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chestnutroaster-175x300.jpg" alt="chestnutroaster" width="175" height="300"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, experts do indeed have theories to explain the acorn problem. Virginia extension agent Adam Downing says acorn production runs in cycles. And apparently last year was a bumper acorn crop. He says a lean year is not unusual following a banner year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It fits with the physiology of seed reproduction. The trees are exhausted, energy wise, from last year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we all know, tired trees are no fun at all. All they do is stand there. They don’t participate, and even a loyal arborphile is forced to seek companionship elsewhere. And often, it’s the little seedlings that end up suffering. It’s sad, but it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the serious part of this nuttiness is, scientists say squirrels could actually suffer from an acorn shortage, along with the oak tree population in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, there is no need to panic just yet. The shortage has not risen to crisis level. Scientists know, however, that it is important to watch the situation closely. If the shortage continues for several years, the issue will have to be addressed more fully.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229530161555"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_parade_goes_woo.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/44dd8034e04974a1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">When PARADE goes woo</title><published>2008-12-17T15:00:05Z</published><updated>2008-12-17T15:00:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/487704670/when_parade_goes_woo.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_parade_goes_woo.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having been sucked into the blogosphere for over four years now and having gotten the majority of my news online or from newsmagazines or the New York Times, I frequently forget that I'm not like the vast majority of people. Neither, I daresay, are my fellow ScienceBloggers or my readers. We don't get our information from the same sources, and we tend towards a lot more scientific sophistication than the average American. This is not to brag or to claim superiority; it is simply an observation that may help explain to some extent why those of us in the science blogosphere have a hard time understanding the great "unwashed masses" in "flyover country." We also tend to forget that, as seemingly important to us that many of the issues we discuss here are, the vast majority of people not only don't read science blogs but are only marginally aware, if at all, of these issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.parade.com"&gt;PARADE Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't normally read PARADE. It's a throwaway magazine that's included in a large number of newspapers every Sunday. Indeed, it's circulated in over 400 papers  and has a circulation of over 32 million, with a readership in excess of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)"&gt;70 million&lt;/a&gt;. Whenever I want an ego check, I consider such numbers and compare them to mine. Even though it continues to amaze me that between 3,000 and 4,000 unique visitors drop in here every weekday, when I see numbers like those of PARADE, I realize my true significance--pretty freakin' minimal. I also realize these days that PARADE appears to be a major promoter of "alternative" medicine. Witness last Sunday's issue, which featured an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.parade.com/health/2008/12/alternative-therapies-that-work.html"&gt;Alternative Therapies That Work&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Mark Liponis. It identifies "three commonly used mind-body therapies that have scientific backing and have passed the litmus test of rigorous medical inquiry."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_parade_goes_woo.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_parade_goes_woo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/487704670" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229526538574"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3519">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/02ad54338f01aba1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="finance"/><category term="financial crisis"/><category term="Ian Ayres"/><title type="html">Dubai, Shanghai, Mumbai, or the Highway</title><published>2008-12-17T16:30:42Z</published><updated>2008-12-17T16:30:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/IsM6C6udfRU/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/dubai-shanghai-mumbai-or-the-highway/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">In early December, I spoke at a Yale Law School breakfast on the current financial crisis - focusing on Robert Shiller's book, The Subprime Solution.

B. Van Helmont in association with another word, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that never caught on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious about a slang use of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Edith Nesbit's &lt;em&gt;The Magic City&lt;/em&gt;, to mean something like "boastful talk". So I looked it up in the OED, where I was waylaid by the etymology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;[A word invented by the Dutch chemist, J. B. Van Helmont (1577-1644), but avowedly based upon the Gr. χάος (‘halitum illum Gas vocavi, non longe a Chao veterum secretum.’ Ortus Medicinæ, ed. 1652, p. 59a); the Dutch pronunciation of g as a spirant accounts for its being employed to represent Gr. χ; perh. suggested by Paracelsus's use of &lt;em&gt;chaos&lt;/em&gt; for the proper element of spirits such as gnomes: see GNOME&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Van Helmont's statement having been overlooked, it has been very commonly supposed that he modelled his word on Du. &lt;em&gt;geest&lt;/em&gt; spirit, an idea found at least as early as 1775 (Priestley &lt;em&gt;On Air&lt;/em&gt; Introd. 3). Van H. also invented the term BLAS, which has not survived, while &lt;em&gt;gas&lt;/em&gt; has been adopted (usually in the same form) in most European languages; the spelling in F. and Pg. is &lt;em&gt;gaz&lt;/em&gt;, which was also employed by English writers for a time.] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Since OED senses are given in historical order, the first sense of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; An occult principle supposed by Van Helmont to be contained in all bodies, and regarded by him as an ultra-rarefied condition of water (see quot. 1662). &lt;em&gt;Obs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the earliest citation in English is not to Chandler's translation of Van Helmont, but rather to an even more curious book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1658&lt;/strong&gt; R. FRANCK &lt;em&gt;North. Mem.&lt;/em&gt; (1694) 202 Insomuch, that neither Gass nor Blass, nor any nauseating suffocating Fumes, nor hardly Death it self can snatch them from Scotland.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1662&lt;/strong&gt; J. CHANDLER &lt;em&gt;Van Helmont's Oriat.&lt;/em&gt; 69 Because the water which is brought into a vapour by cold, is of another condition, than a vapour raised by heat: therefore..for want of a name, I have called that vapour, Gas, being not far severed from the Chaos of the Auntients..Gas is a far more subtile or fine thing than a vapour, mist, or distilled Oylinesses, although as yet, it be many times thicker than Air. But Gas it self, materially taken, is water as yet masked with the Ferment of composed Bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1658 reference is to Richard Franck's  &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IzECAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=titlepage"&gt;Northern Memoirs, Calculated for the Meridian of Scotland; To Which is Added, The Contemplative and Practical Angler. Writ in the Year 1658.&lt;/a&gt; And the context of the cited passage is the following dialogue between Arnoldus and Theophilus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Arn. Does hunger make any distinction in dainties? if not, then why should Scotish kale blot out the character of English colliflowers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Theoph. I shan't dispute the point, but the very thoughts of England sweetens my apprehensions, that possibly e're long I may taste of a southern sallad: However, this I'll say in the honour of Scotland, that cold and hunger are inseparable companions, but their linens are fresh; and were not their beds so short, they would serve well enough for weary travellers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Arn. Then I fancy they will serve well enough for us, whilst we trace the fragrant levels of Fife. For now we relinquish the beautiful ports of Dundee, to transport in boats that are steer'd with a compass of straw, by reason of the embodied mists, to which Dundee is as incident as any part, because standing in a bottom that's besieged with mucky miry earth; from whence there insurrect such pernicious vapours, as nauseate the air ; whereby it becomes almost infectious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Theoph. Why so?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Arn. Because it debilitates both the native and inhabitant, and would certainly incapacitate them of health and long life, did not custom and a country-habit plead a prescription, both as to physick and diet : Insomuch, that neither gass nor blass, nor any nauseating suffocating fumes, nor hardly death it self can snatch them from Scotland ; where some natives have lived to a prodigious age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the OED gives this gloss and citation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Van Helmont's term for a supposed ‘flatus’ or influence of the stars, producing changes of weather.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the English language is poorer for the lack of expressions involving "gas and blas"; it's too bad that 18th-century chemists couldn't find any real substance to which the reference of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; could be transferred, as the reference of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was. Too bad that plasma wasn't discovered until 1879 (and wasn't named until 1928).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229518980969"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=441">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/618101b106794abc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">What’s the Harm?</title><published>2008-12-17T12:57:42Z</published><updated>2008-12-17T12:57:42Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=441" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a website I should have plugged before - it’s called &lt;a href="http://whatstheharm.net/"&gt;whatstheharm.net&lt;/a&gt;. As the name implies, it is an answer to those “&lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=238"&gt;shruggies&lt;/a&gt;” who do not see unscientific or fraudulent medicine as a problem. The site catalogues cases of people harmed by so-called alternative medicine treatments. Most of the cases are due to refusing standard treatment as a result of misplaced faith in unconventional treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Jacqueline Alderslade was told by a homeopath to give up her asthma medication. She subsequently died of an asthma attack. This was a completely avoidable death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this site by &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_faith_in_alternative_medicine_kills.php"&gt;a recent case &lt;/a&gt;of a man who was convicted and will spend 6 month in jail for injuring his daughter. He decided to treat her with bogus supplements rather than seek appropriate medical care, resulting in her suffering heart and brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also this recent case of a couple convicted of abuse after their daughter died of complications of severe excema. They decided to treat her with homeopathic remedies rather than the recommended treatment - long beyond reason should have motivated them to seek medical care for their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, these cases are anecdotal. Yes, there are plenty of stories of “medical misadventures” in standard medicine. These cases are not substitutes for scientific evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these treatments. But given that we can confidently conclude that homeopathy, for example, is worthless and without effect, these stories serve as legitimate cautionary tales. Eschewing proven standard of care medicine and placing unwarranted faith is dubious, implausible, and disproven therapies is not risk free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time someone asks “what’s the harm,” point them toward this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;____________&lt;/p&gt;

I can reply that so many of these modalities are no more than elaborate placebos reinforced with magical thinking. I can explain why science- and evidence-based medicine is superior. I can even point out that the blandishments of quacks all too frequently convince people to forego or delay effective medical therapy, allowing them to become sicker or even become so sick that conventional medicine can no longer save them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or I can &lt;a href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,24809536-421,00.html"&gt;show them&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;An alternative medicine devotee will spend six months behind bars for causing his sick daughter brain damage by refusing to take her to hospital.

&lt;p&gt;The Brisbane District Court was told today the 11-year-old had been suffering from a heart infection for two weeks before her 45-year-old father finally took her to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was gravely ill when she was admitted to Toowoomba Base Hospital in September 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her temperature was 42C, she had been hallucinating and was weak, pale and could no longer walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The court was told her mouth was peeling, black and clogged from the alternative medicine her father had been giving her in extremely high doses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor who finally examined the 11-year-old said in a report the girl was as "sick as the sickest person I've ever seen in 35 years''.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months behind bars for neglect that caused his daughter permanent brain damage? That seems incredibly inadequate to me. This father failed in his fundamental duty to his daughter, namely to provide her with medical care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_faith_in_alternative_medicine_kills.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/when_faith_in_alternative_medicine_kills.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/487306808" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229491366720"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/i_feel_sorry_for_this_kid.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a0e433009666cc6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">I feel sorry for this kid</title><published>2008-12-17T04:51:52Z</published><updated>2008-12-17T04:51:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/487282824/i_feel_sorry_for_this_kid.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/i_feel_sorry_for_this_kid.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This cute, innocent little 3-year-old just wants his name in frosting on his birthday cake, and the &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081217/ap_on_fe_st/odd_hitler_cake"&gt;bakery refused to do it&lt;/a&gt;.

The practitioner directs chi to blockage points corresponding to the patient&amp;#39;s condition, breaking down resistance at these points. As blood flow, neural transmission, and hormone reception are restored, the body is then able to heal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the distance between the patient and the therapist makes no difference. The patient and therapist connect when they are on the phone together, in the same room together, on the same planet together, or on different planets together. The togetherness is the constant, because we are all “connected” by an invisible energy field in our universe. We are all swimming in this energy field together. Quantum physics simply calls distance healing a “non-local event.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the second:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The principle of [example 2] healing is simple.  As &amp;#39;like affects like&amp;#39;, an appropriately manufactured and treated wax doll or cloth puppet may substitute for the patient, and manipulations performed on the doll substitute for those performed on the patient.  Techniques of visualisation and channelling of healing are easy to learn, and it is possible to combine [example 2] with &amp;#39;conventional&amp;#39; or allopathic medicine simply by administering the medicine to the doll rather than to the patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The image may be identified with its subject by the embedding of ousia - items connected with the subject such as a hair or nail clipping, or even a blood sample.  This greatly enhances the therapeutic effects of [example 2] procedures, and in particular allows the practice of [example 2] at considerable distances from the patient, even over the telephone or the Internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well?  Personally I find it hard to believe they aren’t both parodies.  In fact, example 2 is from the &lt;a href="http://www.vetpath.co.uk/voodoo/"&gt;The British Veterinary Voodoo Society&lt;/a&gt; – a spoof site started by some veterinarians in the UK who were incensed that the British Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) sanctions treatment of sick animals with homeopathy.  The joke is that if you think homeopathy works, you might as well try voodoo.  I wrote about &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/11/the_british_vet.html"&gt;The British Veterinary Voodoo Society&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, example1 is a therapy that its proponents seriously claim to be real – &lt;a href="http://tongrenworld.com/TRW_about.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tong Ren&lt;/a&gt;.  Click that link if you must but be warned – the stupid on that site will kill your brain cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t need to write any more on this because fortunately Orac already delved into this in much more detail that I would have had the patience for, and this morning posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/tong_ren_an_unholy_union_of_acupuncture.php"&gt;Tong Ren: An unholy union of acupuncture and voodoo&lt;/a&gt;.  I have to say, after reading the first part of Orac’s post, I got the feeling the Tong Ren site was a parody, and I clicked over there convinced that Orac had been fooled into debunking a spoof site.  After a while though, I decided it was genuine, incredible though that is.  I guess we do need a Poe’s Law for SCAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229487222717"><id gr:original-id="432 at http://www.layscience.net">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9c4849e200c789a6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Major BPSDB Update in Progress - RSS Feed Will be Glitchy</title><published>2008-12-17T02:01:02Z</published><updated>2008-12-17T02:01:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.layscience.net/node/432" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm currently in the middle of rewriting the BPSDB code from the ground up.

While he offers some fair criticisms of my book he also said some pretty great things about it like...&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[John's book addresses] almost every conceivable argument for Evangelical Christianity in extraordinary and sobering detail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[It contains] a treasure trove of sources...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[John] essentially turns the same leave-no-stone-unturned approach employed by the new apologetics movement (which he was trained in, by Craig no less) against that very movement. He has clearly read extensively and has a firm grasp of contemporary Christian apologetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every important aspect of intellectual Evangelical Christian belief comes in for critique, and often in more depth than you'll find in any other pro-atheism tome. Indeed, unlike, say, Sam Harris or Richard Dawkins, Loftus is a fully-informed insider who knows what he's talking about. He was fully immersed in making the very case for Christianity that he now tears down. He was trained by the best, is well-read in the field, and gets all the nuances that apologists accuse pop atheists (like Harris and Dawkins) of missing. In this regard, Loftus is even more in-the-know than I am, tackling issues I know very little about (like contemporary Evangelical doctrines of hell or the trinity--topics that simply don't interest me, but that certainly interest believers and whose intellectual coherence is essential if Evangelical faith is to have any chance at credibility).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a sense, &lt;em&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/em&gt; is something like an ex-Christian version of J.P. Moreland's &lt;em&gt;Scaling the Secular City&lt;/em&gt;. Where Moreland's aim was to tear down naturalism, Loftus' aim is to tear down Moreland's worldview. And yet, Loftus' work is denser and more erudite than Moreland's, by far. In fact, that may be its principal failing: it's so intellectual and thoroughgoing, I worry most Christians won't even be able to get through a fraction of it. On the other hand, for the more educated and intellectual, this is exactly what they need to read. Even though any Christian could pick at bits, the overall force of his case is, IMO, invincibly fatal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[O]ne of the best things that Loftus contributes to the field of atheist philosophy, which I think is required reading for everyone, on both sides of the debate, is his Outsider Test (here in chapter 4). Given that, and his thorough scope and erudition, I doubt any honest, rational, informed Evangelical can remain in the fold after reading this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[It's] a serious scholarly treatment of Christian apologetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks Richard, coming from you whom I hold in high regard means a lot to me! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To read Richard's criticisms go to the link provided.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This is a 'support-group' for vaccine-damaged children, or to put it cynically, people whose children have developed problems, which the parents put down to vaccines, irrespective of the evidence. JABS became synonymous with an anti-MMR stance (indeed anti-vaccine in general), and so no amount of evidence would ever convince them of its relative safety. Many &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2004/sep/08/familyandrelationships.lifeandhealth"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://jabsloonies.blogspot.com/2008/12/just-as-you-think-its-all-calming-down.html"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; have criticised JABS for its terrible 'science' or its &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/jabs-forum-vile-and-abusive/"&gt;abusive nature&lt;/a&gt; towards anyone who dares suggest that MMR and autism are not connected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/05/20/why-does-the-bbc-link-to-jabs/"&gt;The BBC&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/bbc-dont-link-to-jabs/"&gt;stopped linking to JABS&lt;/a&gt; after being made aware of the site's contents and there has even been a &lt;a href="http://www.jabz.org.uk/"&gt;piss-take set-up&lt;/a&gt;. I wrote about their odd ways and their connection with the truly out-of-this-planet-utterly-bananas site, Whale.to &lt;a href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/02/believe-what-you-like-just-dont-expect.html"&gt;earlier this year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With your monitor set to 'Weird Mode' have a look at a JABS conversation &lt;a href="http://www.jabs.org.uk/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3358"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/"&gt;The Science Museum&lt;/a&gt; is one of London's great free museums, holding over 300,00 artefacts of scientific and medical significance. The website also contains a section called 'Antenna' which is the Science News section, with a special section on &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/mmr/"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For three months you've been telling the Science Museum your concerns about MMR - the measles, mumps and rubella triple vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armed with your questions, fears and arguments a team from the Museum set off to interrogate the major players in the controversy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Controversy&lt;/span&gt;? Not for a long time. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Hoax&lt;/span&gt; would be a better choice of word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clicking on "What about single jabs?" and then "Where can I get them?", the Science Museum website happily suggests emailing JABS for some advice. The &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt; museum suggests contacting an anti-vaccine pressure group on advice for vaccines. Perhaps the Science Museum should be weighing up government advice and making a decision on the evidence rather sending parents, who are trying to do the best by their kids, to rather odd inhabitants of JABS-world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The JABS website itself states:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;JABS is not primarily a provider of vaccine information but a support group of parents who feel their children have suffered a reaction or have been severely damaged by a vaccine&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;... so what is the point of sending people there who are trying to find out about single vaccines? Despite this website claim, the Science Museum has &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/mmr/cip4/128.asp"&gt;page with a photo&lt;/a&gt; of Jackie Fletcher (JABS co-ordinator) stating:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Jackie Fletcher of vaccine-damage support group JABS also offers advice for parents regardless of whether they are opting for single jabs or the full MMR. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;How balanced an opinion do you think you will get from JABS on this issue? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's clear the Science Museum needs to completely update and revamp its MMR site, and do its part to relegate the MMR hoax to science history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;EDITED 17/12/2008: If you would like to let the Science Museum know about their backwards stance on this issue, the contact details are &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/contact_us.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Hat-tip to Duck &amp;amp; Tristan @ Bad Science.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-9073285321856483572?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229459315159"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4767">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fd8688caf7f1422a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 12.16</title><published>2008-12-16T20:03:27Z</published><updated>2008-12-16T20:03:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4767" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=1bf777bb9635655676b4221d9cca69d8&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet Darwin’s Beagle it’s been a busy week or two!  Even though lots of it was &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arealgirl/3100760642/"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arealgirl/3102470593/"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt;,  still loads going on for me.  So much that I’ve been prone to daydreaming myself into the coolest, most creative jobs ever.  For example, yesterday when I was prepping the class I’m teaching today, I was thinking how much cooler it would be to be gearing up to tour with &lt;a href="http://www.thedonnas.com/"&gt;The Donnas&lt;/a&gt;.  (Do they need a new bass player?)  What about you guys?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/Xl_MHGY1c-o%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want horrible, credulous, idiotic reporting, the above segment has it all. Indeed, it doesn't even include the usual obligatory brief sound bite from a skeptic! True, it does mention that the Massachusetts State Board of Medicine's Committee on Acupuncture had received complaints about Tom Tam for his claiming to be a "master" acupuncturist, but it in essence dismissed them as carping from critics, while holding up a dubious survey being taken by someone at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute as "evidence" for an efficacy due to Tong Ren sufficient to catch the interest of that august medical institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also note the breast cancer testimonial in the segment. Note how the woman giving the testimonial (who has now become a Tong Ren practitioner, by the way) did have a partial mastectomy but refused chemotherapy and radiation. Now read my &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/understanding_alternative_medi_1.php"&gt;post about breast cancer testimonials&lt;/a&gt; from nearly four years ago. Read Dr. Peter Moran's example of a &lt;a href="http://members.bordernet.com.au/~pmoran/cancer/BCtestimonial.htm"&gt;typical breast cancer testimonial&lt;/a&gt;. It's a typical testimonial from a breast cancer patient who doesn't understand that for surgically treatable breast cancer, surgery is the primary "cure." Radiation reduces the risk that the tumor will come back in the same breast, and chemotherapy reduces the risk that the tumor will come back elsewhere in the body as a metastasis, but surgical removal of the primary tumor is the primary therapy. Even removal of the lymph nodes or a sentinel lymph node biopsy is generally agreed not to be therapeutic, but rather diagnostic, a means of determining tumor stage and from that stage what further therapy is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know one reason why so many people believe that obvious quackery like Tong Ren "works," look no further than to awful reporting like the news segment above. But if you really want brain-melting stupid, look at the promo segment for the above report:&lt;br&gt;

Thus we are sure that you will soon read that 2008 was warmer than any year in the 20th Century (with the exception of 1998), that is was the coolest year this century (starting from 2001), and that 7 or 8 of the 9 warmest years have occurred since 2000. There will undoubtedly also be a number of claims made that aren't true; 2008 is not the coolest year this decade (that was 2000), global warming hasn't 'stopped', CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; continues to be a greenhouse gas, and such variability is indeed predicted by climate models. Today's post is therefore dedicated to cutting through the hype and looking at the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is usual, today marks the release of the 'meteorological year' averages for the surface temperature records (&lt;a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp"&gt;GISTEMP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/#datdow"&gt;HadCRU&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/anomalies/anomalies.html#anomalies"&gt;NCDC&lt;/a&gt;). This time period runs from December last year through to the end of November this year and is so-called because of the fact that it is easier to dice into seasons than the calendar year. That is, the met year consists of the average of the DJF (winter), MAM (spring), JJA (summer) and SON (autumn) periods (using the standard shorthand for the month names). This makes a little more sense than including the JF from one winter and the D from another as you do in the calendar year calculation. But since the correlation between the D-N and J-D averages is very high (r=0.997), it makes little practical difference. Annual numbers are a little more useful than monthly anomalies for determining long term trends, but are still quite noisy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: In the GISTEMP, HadCRU and NCDC analyses D-N 2008 were at 0.43, 0.42 and 0.47ºC above the 1951-1980 baseline (respectively). In GISTEMP both October and November came in quite warm (0.58ºC), the former edging up slightly on last month's estimate as more data came in. This puts 2008 at #9 (or #8) in the yearly rankings, but given the uncertainty in the estimates, the real ranking could be anywhere between #6 or #15. More robustly, the most recent 5-year averages are all significantly higher than any in the last century. The last decade is by far the warmest decade globally in the record. These big picture conclusions are the same if you look at any of the data sets, though the actual numbers are slightly different (relating principally to the data extrapolation - particularly &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/11/mind-the-gap/"&gt;in the Arctic&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to make of the latest year's data? First off, we &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; that there will be oscillations in the global mean temperature. No climate model has ever shown a year-on-year increase in temperatures because of the currently expected amount of global warming. A big factor in those oscillations is &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/07/global-trends-and-enso/"&gt;ENSO&lt;/a&gt; - whether there is a a warm El Niño event, or a cool La Niña event makes an appreciable difference in the global mean anomalies - about 0.1 to 0.2ºC for significant events. There &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a significant &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/people/klaus.wolter/MEI/"&gt;La Niña&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of this year (and that is fully included in the D-N annual mean), and that undoubtedly played a role in this year's relative coolness. It's worth pointing out that 2000 also had a similarly sized La Niña but was notably cooler than this last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ENSO is one factor in the annual variability, it is not the only one. There are both other sources of internal variability and external forcings. The other internal variations can be a little difficult to characterise (it isn't as simple as just a super-position of all the climate acronyms you ever heard of NAO+SAM+PDO+AMO+MJO etc.), but the external (natural) forcings are a little easier. The two main ones are volcanic variability and solar forcing. There have been no climatically significant volcanoes since 1991, and so that is not a factor. However, we are at a &lt;a href="http://www.pmodwrc.ch/tsi/composite/pics/org_comp2_d41_61_0810.png"&gt;solar minimum&lt;/a&gt;. The impacts of the solar cycle on the surface temperature record are somewhat disputed, but it might be as large as 0.1ºC from solar min to solar max, with a lag of a year or two. Thus for 2008, one might expect a deviation below trend (the difference between mean solar and solar min, and expecting the impact to not yet be fully felt) of up to 0.05ºC. Not a very big signal, and not one that would shift the rankings significantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of rather overheated &lt;a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Temperature+Monitors+Report+Worldwide+Global+Cooling/article10866.htm"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that 'all the global warming had been erased' by the La Niña-related anomaly. This was always ridiculous, and now that most of that anomaly has passed, we aren't holding our breath waiting for the 'global warming is now back' headlines from the same sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a longer perspective, the 30 year mean trends aren't greatly affected by a single year (GISTEMP: 1978-2007 0.17+/-0.04ºC/dec; 1979-2008 0.16+/-0.04 - OLS trends, annual data, 95% CI, no correction for auto-correlation; identical for HadCRU); they are still solidly upwards.  The match of the &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/05/hansens-1988-projections/"&gt;Hansen et al 1988&lt;/a&gt; scenario B projections are similarly little affected (GISTEMP 1984-2008 0.19+/-0.05 (LO-index) 0.22+/-0.07 (Met-station index); HansenB 1984-2008 0.25+/-0.05 ºC/dec) - the projections run slightly warmer as one would expect given the slightly greater (~10%) forcing in the  projection then occurred in reality. This year's data then don't really change our expectations much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as we've discussed &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/what-the-ipcc-models-really-say/"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, what climate models did or did not predict is available for all to &lt;a href="http://climexp.knmi.nl/"&gt;see&lt;/a&gt;. Despite many cautions about using short-term changes to imply something about the long-term trend, these comparisons will still be made. So just for fun, here is a comparison of the observations with the model projections from 1999 to 2008 using 1999 as a baseline. The answer might be surprising for some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.realclimate.org/images/2008_from1999.jpg" alt="1999-2008 model and data trends"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get slightly different pictures if you pick the start year differently, and so this isn't something profound. Picking &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; single year as a starting point is somewhat subjective and causes the visual aspect to vary - looking at the trends is more robust. However, this figure does show that in models, as in data, some years will be above trend, and some will be below trend. Anyone who expresses shock at this is either naive or … well, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the next few years, our expectations are not much changed. This coming winter is predicted to be ENSO neutral, so on that basis one would expect a warmer year next year than this year (though probably not quite record breaking). Barring any large volcanic eruption, I don't see any reason for the decadal trends to depart much from the anticipated ~0.2ºC/decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Just FYI, the same figure as above baselined to &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/2008_from1990.jpg"&gt;1990&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/images/2008_from1979.jpg"&gt;1979&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, frequent commenter and Official Friend of Skepchick Blake Stacey has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/2008/12/book_announcement_until_earths.php"&gt;published a book&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;We still don’t know. We’re pretty sure it exists; several independent observations indicate that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. We’ve known for almost a century that the Universe is getting bigger, but in 1998 it was discovered that the &lt;em&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; at which it expands is itself getting bigger every day. Whatever is behind this is acting almost like anti-gravity, or more accurately a pressure that is making the Universe inflate faster every second of every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3111287108/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3237/3111287108_c4f3102b0a_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The galaxy cluster Abell 85 (optical image on left) is infused with million degree gas that gives off X-rays (right). By measuring the amount of this gas, astronomers have determined that dark energy exists and that it’s a constant throughout the cosmos. Not bad from a pink blob. Credit: NASA/CXC/SAO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we don’t know what the heck this stuff is. We’ve hung the name &amp;quot;dark energy&amp;quot; on it, but we know very little about it. For example, is it a constant across space, with a strength that never changes with distance or time? Or is it a function of space itself? If it’s the latter, that means it gets stronger as space itself expands. That is, if there is some amount of dark energy in every cubic centimeter of space, and there are more cubic centimeters of space as the Universe expands, then dark energy will get stronger as time goes on. That means &lt;em&gt;the acceleration will accelerate&lt;/em&gt;, growing ever-more until the Universe tears itself apart!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re talking here about determining the eventual fate of the entire Universe. Obviously, there’s some interest in this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now astronomers have found a new way to measure dark energy that may be able to differentiate between the two contenders. When the Universe was young, matter started to coalesce by gravity, forming huge structures millions of light years across. These collapsed to form galaxies and clusters of galaxies, like cities composed of thousands of smaller towns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Universe were not expanding, forming clusters would be easy. As time went on, more matter could fall in to the cluster, forming more galaxies and making the cluster bigger. But since the Universe &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; expanding, there was a limit to how big the clusters could get; the outermost fringes would be moving away from the central regions, and that limited the amount of raw material available to make galaxies. It’s like going to the grocery store and trying to fill your cart with cans of spaghetti sauce, only to find workers removing the cans from the shelf at the same time. The number of cans you wind up with depends on how quickly the grocery store clerks are unshelving them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the sizes of clusters today depends on how quickly the Universe expands, and this cosmic expansion depends on the amount and flavor of dark energy infusing it. Aha! If we carefully study the sizes of clusters in the near and distant Universe, we can get a handle on dark energy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just what Alexey Vikhlinin of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and his team did. They examined the hot gas in more than a dozen clusters with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The gas is the raw building material of clusters, and can be used as a tracer for how the clusters formed and how big and massive they are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found is, to me, something of a relief. First, they confirmed that the growth of clusters is consistent with the presence of dark energy in the first place (some people still doubt that dark energy exists, but this is another nail in the coffin of any alternative hypotheses). Second, they found that their results indicate that dark energy is a constant throughout the Universe. That is, it is not growing in strength with time, and the Universe won’t rip itself to shreds in the dim future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m impressed with this work. One good thing about it is that it’s independent of any other measurements of dark energy that have gone on before. We’ve been using things like distant supernovae to measure how fast the Universe is expanding; that’s how dark energy was discovered in the first place. Other studies have looked at the pervasive microwave glow of the Universe, and other indicators have been used as well. This is the first to use the hot gas in clusters, and it doesn’t rely on these other methods. That makes scientists more confident the result is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that we really understand dark energy yet. We can measure its effects, but we don’t know what the heck it &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt;. The most recent work is also bothersome: it indicates that the amount of dark energy in the cosmos we measure is 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt; times smaller than it should be. That’s a bit off! Obviously, there is something we’re missing, and many people suspect that there are extra dimensions to the Universe that we cannot see, and this may be the problem (it may also explain why gravity is so much weaker than the other three fundamental forces, but that’s another story…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that this new work with clusters may shed some light on dark energy, and on the very nature of the Universe itself. But to me, there is more good news… What all of this is telling us is that the Universe is even more complex than we thought. That makes it more interesting, more cool, and more &lt;em&gt;fun!&lt;/em&gt; There’s so much more left to learn, and the path to that knowledge is where the adventure lies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229450383717"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/first_they_came_for_the_mad_sc.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c72b0e86a967d149</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">First they came for the mad scientists…oh, hey, that&amp;#39;s me!</title><published>2008-12-16T17:44:18Z</published><updated>2008-12-16T17:44:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/486812564/first_they_came_for_the_mad_sc.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/first_they_came_for_the_mad_sc.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Man, it's getting to the point where a fellow can't even build a death ray or an island fortress shaped like a skull without someone getting pissy about it. Take this account, for instance, of a few people just &lt;a title="The Hooping Humanist" href="http://thehoopinghumanist.blogspot.com/"&gt;playing around with skeletons and lab coats&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of students had their 'Mad Scientist' party brought to an abrupt end when police mistook them for terrorists.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The private party, held in Hackney, north London, was organised by a group of friends dressed in white laboratory coats and wigs, who put on a display of theatrical 'experiments' to entertain guests.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But when police entered the building for a routine check in the early hours of Sunday morning, they discovered scientific debris and plastic skeletons and mistook it for terrorist paraphernalia or drug-making equipment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Caretaker of the property, Richard Watson, 29, was arrested under The Anti-Terrorism Act and questioned while the entire area was evacuated and roads cordoned off with police tape.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He said: 'I was handcuffed and put in the back of the police van for over an hour while the bomb squad and drugs team came down.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
'There was a ridiculous amount of police there. Every time I looked out of the van I could see a new group of them swarming around.'
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Three fire engines and three ambulances were also called to the scene as Mr Watson was searched and interrogated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self: clean up debris in basement soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/first_they_came_for_the_mad_sc.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/486812564" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229449419655"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-5834240675268669407">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2814fb99d86da6fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Atheism" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Atheists Are Smarter than Agnostics</title><published>2008-12-16T17:31:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-16T17:32:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/atheists-are-smarter-than-agnostics.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/5834240675268669407/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=5834240675268669407" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Science proves it.</summary><author><name>Larry Moran</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Sandwalk</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229445394225"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3523">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f71c530938f72db1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="game theory"/><category term="games"/><category term="Ian Ayres"/><title type="html">An All-Pay Auction</title><published>2008-12-16T16:15:51Z</published><updated>2008-12-16T16:15:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/hXVnibRKJsI/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/an-all-pay-auction/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Martin Shubik invented a famous game-theory exercise, sometimes called "the dollar auction," where a teacher auctions off a $20 bill to the highest bidder.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Regular readers may remember Scott from &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/09/04/tales-of-dragoncon-soupbone-and-me/"&gt;The Night of Silliness at Dragon*Con&lt;/a&gt;, or you may know him as a famous writer and podcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know he’s a talented guy, so when I found out he had written a science-based horror novel called &lt;em&gt;Infected&lt;/em&gt;, I had to read it. I love scary stuff, and this did not disappoint. It’s fast-paced, well-developed, and many times gave me the heebie-jeebies. Turns out, chicken scissors can be used with great effect in the hands — so to speak — of a writer like Scott. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now he has written a sequel called &lt;em&gt;Contagious&lt;/em&gt;, and my copy has not yet arrived (it comes out December 30), but I’m thinking it’s going to be really good. &lt;a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/"&gt;He’s already started podcasting it on his site&lt;/a&gt;, so if you’re some kind of young kid who likes to listen to books instead of hold them in your hands like you’re supposed to, GET OFF MY LAWN and go to his site to download the episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help promote his book, he roped me into this actually pretty cool idea: he has created a dozen posters with plot hints on them, but you need to collect all 12 to figure it out. He set up one poster each for twelve of the bestest, well-writtenest, all-around-awesomest websites he could find, and whaddyaknow, I made the cut. So here’s the poster from Scott to me to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait! There’s more! Some creative soul &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQpM4apJNPQ"&gt;made a trailer for the book&lt;/a&gt;. This is maybe a little NSFW and probably NSF young ‘uns, too.&lt;/p&gt;

The pills have been pushed as cures for series diseases like cancer and Down’s Syndrome, with no studies backing them up. Despite the fact that this little girl was nearly killed by these supplements in 2006, and &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/apwire/78d4005420e48a2493a231a3e5c228b8.htm"&gt;despite the $11.25 million class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; the company lost earlier this year, the Mannatech web site is still alive and kicking, making no claims aside from squishy, safe references to helping your “total wellness,” and “promoting health” for adults and children. Their “Ambrotose® complex” is made from “plant sources” and helps your body’s cells “communicate” with one another. The complex contains “glyconutrients,” a made-up term for simple sugars that have not been proven through any properly controlled studies to help any disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s not much else to say except that I hope this is the most depressing thing I read today.&lt;/p&gt;

I think they're wrong, that it's a harmless expression of naked contempt, and that there &lt;i&gt;ought&lt;/i&gt; to be more contempt expressed towards this president, but let's compromise. No throwing shoes. How about politely &lt;i&gt;handing&lt;/i&gt; them to him?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2008/12/because-we-wont-have-him-to-kick-around_15.html"&gt;Rude Pundit had a brilliant and obvious idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, the Rude Pundit decided to honor the efforts of Muntader al-Zaidi, the Iraqi shoe-tosser, by taking out a raggedy old pair of sneakers, putting them in a Priority Mail shipping box, helpfully provided by the United States Post Office, and shipping them to President George W. Bush at the White House. He included a note that read, "This is a farewell kiss from the American people, you dog."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since throwing objects at the president is generally considered a crime, the Rude Pundit figures sending shoes to Bush is a small, good thing, a gesture of contempt that has context. Sweet Christ, at this point, there should be giant sacks of shoes heading to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC, 20500, like letters to Santa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of you can have any objections in principle to that, I should hope. Let us all make our own small protest and send George W Bush a little Christmas present, a polite version of an upraised middle finger, and box up some old shoes and send him a deluge of metaphorical and symbolic disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would also be nice if the shoes were at least serviceable, so maybe the White House could follow up with one last decent act by donating them to the needy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alternative suggestion&lt;/b&gt;! I really like the idea mentioned in the comments. Since the shoes won't actually be seen Bush and will probably be thrown out, cut out the middleman and do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donate a pair of shoes to the local charity of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send Bush a postcard, stating, "A pair of shoes has been donated to the needy in your name. This is a farewell kiss from the American people, you dog."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, cheap, and it gets the message across just as well, while also doing something good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/shoes_for_christmas.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/486667438" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229440093266"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=440">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/12442a93e7191cb5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><title type="html">Mind-Reading Software</title><published>2008-12-16T15:02:32Z</published><updated>2008-12-16T15:02:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=440" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Headlines declare, “&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16267-mindreading-software-could-record-your-dreams.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;amp;nsref=online-news"&gt;Mind-Reading software could record your dreams.&lt;/a&gt;” Of course, those in the business of writing headlines for news articles are notorious pathological liars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology being reported on is indeed very intriguing, but it actually has nothing directly to do with recording dreams. This is just one speculative future application when and if the technology significantly matures. But that’s what the headline writer pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the reporting of advances in so-called metamaterials that have a negative refractice index. These materials have many possible and plausible applications. Perhaps the least plausible and most highly speculative application would be the creation of an invisibility cloak. So of course, the headlines read that scientists make breakthrough in creating an invisibility cloak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology is potentially very cool, even without sensational exaggeration. Jack Gallant and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley have demonstrated that they can predict which image out of a set of candidates a subject is viewing just by looking at their fMRI scan - at the pattern of activity in their visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better, Yukiyasu Kamitani at ATR Computational Neuroscience Laboratories in Kyoto, Japan has demonstrated that he can predict what a subject is viewing even without having candidate images to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they are doing is this - they show subjects test patterns while recording their brain activity using fMRI. They then use software to correlate the brain patterns to the viewed images. Kamitani specifically used this technique to create a grid of black and white pixels representing visual cortical activity. They then show the subject a new image and the software interprets the fMRI to see which pixels are active, and it reconstructs what the subject is looking at. Kamitani was able to use this technique to read the word “neuron” that a subject was viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology is still very crude - in it’s infancy, if you will. The images produces are fuzzy and low-resolution. Subjects need to be “calibrated” before they can be read. And only black and white, static, crude images can be generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this is, however, is a proof of concept. It means that patterns of brain activity are reproducible enough to be interpreted by software using the current resolution of fMRI scanning. With higher resolution fMRI, better software, and more elaborate calibration it may be possible to view much more detailed images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to add color. It may be possible to add motion - create video. It remains to be seen if the technology can image what a person is thinking, as opposed to what they are currently viewing, but previous research suggests that the pattern of brain activity should be similar. And then other aspects of brain function, such as language, can be investigated. There is a great deal of work to be done before this kind of technology becomes more than a laboratory curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary question is what are the ultimate limitations of this kind of technology? Brain activity is pretty chaotic, even though there are stable patterns. Might that chaos of activity always blur the patterns, limiting resolution and fidelity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brains slowly evolve over time as we learn, experience, grow, and age. How quickly will the calibration become obsolete?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution of fMRI is inherently limited. It images blood flow and infers brain activity from that. Likely we will need a more direct imaging of neuronal firing to produce significantly higher resolution “mind reading.” What will that require? Can it be done remotely, or will an invasive “brain jack” be required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we’ll figure this out as we go along. It is an intriguing concept - and perhaps will be looked back upon as the first tentative steps into true computer-brain interfacing, along with parallel research looking into software control through brain electrodes (like the monkey’s who can control robotic arms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we’ll be recording dreams anytime soon, however. Even optimistically, that application will likely take decades.&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly, lately, I've been wondering lately if there was anything left that could surprise me or horrify me anymore, and jaded is not a good way to be as a blogger. Indeed, in retrospect, I wonder if jadedness was why I had to stop &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/skepticismcritical_thinking/friday_woo/"&gt;Your Friday Dose of Woo&lt;/a&gt; for a while, the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/07/three_uneaten_ears_of_corn.php"&gt;death of my dog&lt;/a&gt; notwithstanding, and why I'm happier now that I no longer feel obligated to do it every Friday. And, even now, every so often, there's something so bizarre, something I've never heard of before, something that takes me by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/woo_in_the_military_acupuncture.php"&gt;ragging on acupuncture&lt;/a&gt;--and justifiably so, I like to think. Having gone from sort of believer (or at least being somewhat open-minded about it) to realizing what that it is no more than an elaborate placebo and produces nonspecific effects that one would expect of an elaborate placebo, thanks to having actually taken the time over the last couple of years to read the clinical and scientific literature on acupuncture, I've yet to find compelling evidence that can convince me that I've made a mistake or that there is something to this woo. After all, what is acupuncture at its heart but another "energy healing" modality? Think about it. The entire basis of acupuncture is the scientifically risible claim that by sticking tiny needles into hundreds of small points along "meridians" through which &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt; ("life energy") flows, an acupuncturist can "unblock" or "redirect" the flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt;. But acupuncturists don't make the claim that they can unblock or redirect the flow of &lt;em&gt;qi&lt;/em&gt; but add to that claim another claim, namely that they can do this for therapeutic intent for all sorts of physiologically unrelated conditions. The only reason I used to give acupuncture a bit of a pass was because it actually involved a physical act, sticking needles in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I used to tend to give acupuncture a bit of a pass was that, like Dirty Harry Callahan, whose famous tagline from the second Dirty Harry movie &lt;em&gt;Magnum Force&lt;/em&gt; was, "A man's got to know his limitations." And so it was with most acupuncturists, who (mostly) treat chronic pain syndromes, headache, or other conditions with a large subjective component, almost as if they acknowledge that what they provide is a placebo and a little TLC for patients who might be fed up with many of the shortcomings of scientific medicine. I almost never heard of an acupuncturist claiming to be able to treat life-threatening conditions, such as cancer. Indeed, such claims were uncommon enough that I can't remember the last time I've heard of an acupuncturist claiming to cure fatal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behold Tom Tam, an acupuncturist in the Boston area who, based on dolls that map acupuncture meridians, has created a "healing modality" that he calls &lt;a href="http://tongrenworld.com/TRW_about.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tong Ren&lt;/a&gt;. Here he is on a poorly conceived and typically credulous local news report:&lt;/p&gt;

And Coonan, who seems to be The Independent's &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/search/index.jsp"&gt;regular China correspondent&lt;/a&gt;, must be quite well informed about Chinese culture, politics and language.  But given his broad experience in China, and his status as an experienced writer for a major newpaper, I found some things in his article surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Let's start with this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Chinese is a tonal language, which means words sounding the same can often have very different meanings depending on how they are spoken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is true, if you add an appropriate qualification: "Chinese is a tonal language, which means words sounding the same (to people who don't pay attention to tone) can often have very different meanings depending on how they are spoken".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, for a randomly-selected pair of languages X and Y, there's a reasonably high probability that "words (in X) sounding the same (to speakers of Y) often have very different meanings depending on how they are spoken". For example, the English vowel distinction that differentiates "bit" from "beat" is hard or impossible for native speakers of many other languages to learn to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s really puzzling about this sentence is not its misleading way of describing lexical tone, but rather the implication that Chinese tone is somehow relevant to MPI&amp;#39;s unfortunate choice of cover art. Remember that the editors of the Max Planck Forshung apparently couldn&amp;#39;t read Chinese, and their expert advisor, asked to find a typical bit of Chinese text to put on the cover, apparently subverted their intent by choosing a strip club ad. However, the fact that Chinese is a tone language is completely irrelevant to all this — exactly the same thing could have happened with material in Japanese, or Korean, or Hindi, or Arabic. For that matter, it could have happened with Hungarian or Swahili or another language written with the Latin alphabet — all that&amp;#39;s required is some written material that the editors can&amp;#39;t read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after the remark about Chinese tone, Coonan's story continues with some examples of foreigners not being able to read Chinese characters, as if this were somehow connected to the fact that Chinese is tonal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;There are tales of drunken teenagers walking out of tattoo parlours with characters reading, "This is one ugly foreigner" or "A fool and his money are easily parted".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These "tales" were apparently found on &lt;a href="http://www.anti-cnn.com/"&gt;anti-cnn.com&lt;/a&gt;, which Coonan describes as "a foreigner-baiting website set up after a commentator on the US broadcaster made anti-Chinese comments following the crackdown in Tibet in March". However, he doesn't cite any specific examples, and I strongly suspect that the tales are jokes or urban legends. Reading &lt;a href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/"&gt;Hanzi Smatter&lt;/a&gt; certainly convinces me that tattoo artists are very unreliable guides to Hanzi characters and Hanzi texts. But all the examples that I've seen are cases where both the tattooers and the tattooees are clueless, not cases where the tattooers actually know Chinese and use that knowledge to mock customers who lack it.  (Please give us links to specific counter-examples, if I'm wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the relationship between these mythical drunken teenage tattoo victims and their mythical victimizers would be analogous to the relationship between MPI's editors and their expert. But given the fact that the teenagers probably don't exist, juxtaposed with the confused and confusing statement about Chinese tone, a better analogy might be the relationship between the Independent's readers and Clifford Coonan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coonan's other example of a bamboozled foreigner at least has the virtue of being based on a partly-true story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Another web-user wrote: "I recently met a German girl with a Chinese tattoo on her neck which in Chinese means 'prostitute'. I laughed so loud, I could hardly breathe."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether the "web-user" in question actually met such a girl. A "prostitute" tattoo is documented &lt;a href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/2008/11/prostitute.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.checkoutmyink.com/tattoos/grampagravity/bitch-2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but the tattooer and tattooee in this case seem to be American, not German. Since the tattoo in question was prominently featured on the Hanzi Smatter front page for some time before the MPI story broke, I strongly suspect that Coonan&amp;#39;s source &amp;quot;improved&amp;quot; the story, in the usual sort of way of urban legends, by turning it into a personal experience (&amp;quot;I recently met …&amp;quot;) and inventing relevant circumstantial detail (&amp;quot;… a German girl …&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the &lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8531656&amp;amp;postID=4658327917816298705"&gt;commenters at Hanzi Smatter explain&lt;/a&gt;, this was almost surely an attempt to translate into Chinese a genre of inverted-prestige tattoo that is also common in English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I've seen plenty of tattoos on BMEzine.com saying things like "Slut for life" in English.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, although 妓 (jì) &lt;a href="http://www.mandarintools.com/cgi-bin/wordlook.pl?word=%E5%A6%93+&amp;amp;searchtype=chinese&amp;amp;where=whole"&gt;does mean "prostitute"&lt;/a&gt; in Chinese, one of the commenters at Hanzi Smatter &lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8531656&amp;amp;postID=4658327917816298705"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In Japanese and Korean (and apparently in its original Chinese usage as well), it has a sense of a "woman of the arts" (i.e. geisha, etc.), and, according to Kojien, it's even possible to use it in kabuki, which is normally 歌舞伎, but can also be 歌舞妓.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests an alternative explanation — though I think that the &amp;quot;Slut for life&amp;quot; model is more plausible, since the person posting the &lt;a href="http://www.checkoutmyink.com/tattoos/grampagravity/bitch-2"&gt;picture at checkoutmyink.com&lt;/a&gt; described it as  "My girl's 'Bitch' tattoo. So fitting", with &lt;a href="http://www.checkoutmyink.com/assets/photos/0014/8753/101_1640_large.JPG"&gt;this additional picture as evidence&lt;/a&gt; — but in neither case is there any indication that the tattooee was culpably ignorant of the meaning of the tattoo, or was being fooled in this respect by the tattooer.&lt;/p&gt;

Given that sleep deprivation has been shown to impair various aspects of human performance, it certainly seems reasonable to limit the level of "resident impairment".  But we have surprisingly little data to work from.  And, for better or worse, physicians post-residency don't have much of a choice when it comes to work hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife often remarks on how I'm able to answer a page out of a deep sleep, give orders, and go back to sleep.  Upon morning review, these orders do, in fact, make sense.  It was my training that allowed me to be able to function this way, and it's a damned good thing.  I'm not arguing that residents should be worked into the ground like in the good old days.  We must take into account the impairment that lack of sleep may cause,  but we must also recognize that learning to think and act under a variety of conditions is important.  Also, patient continuity of care is important, and the more that a patient is "handed off" from team to team, the less likely any one doctor is to take responsibility for that patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that's not really what I meant to write about.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;My comments were deleted twice here. Apparently, someone is offended by me saying 'this incident shows how ignorant the West (and its academics) are of the non-Western world'. What pettiness!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deleted this comment, just as I had deleted the same individual's first attempt, which consisted only of a one-sentence indictment of Western academics, and the second attempt, which added the accusation of censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?page_id=72"&gt;maintain a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio in the comments section&lt;/a&gt;, I'll continue to be skeptical of  comments that lack specific and relevant content. To put this skepticism into context, though, you need to understand something about how comments work in a standard WordPress blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time that a comment is registered from a given email address, it&amp;#39;s held up for moderation — it won&amp;#39;t appear until and unless one of the blog contributors approves it. After that, any comments from the same email address will appear immediately, without moderation, though contributors can delete them after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own policy as a moderator of first comments is to reject those that seem to me to lack content, whether I agree with them or not. Therefore I reject &amp;quot;Me too&amp;quot; comments, unless the context is a poll of opinions; and likewise &amp;quot;This is disgusting&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I disagree&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Bravo!&amp;quot;.  Similarly, I tend to reject first comments that simply restate some aspect of the post, or a previous comment, without adding any content. This is partly because such comments are often spam or near-spam, but mostly because, well, they&amp;#39;re intellectually empty. Other LL contributors have more — or mostly less — tolerance for vacuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rarely delete comments that have not been held up for moderation, unless they're gratuitously off topic, offensively contentless, or contentlessly offensive. If someone has shown that they have interesting things to say, an occasional "me too" or "oh come on" is fine, especially because I don't want to spend time editing our comments section, since this would cut intolerably into the hour a day or so that I can devote to blogging. Again, other contributors have somewhat different standards, mostly in the direction of preferring not to deal with comments at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case under discussion, Victor's post explained in detail one instance of ignorance of  written Chinese.  In my opinion, Baishui's comment added nothing except for an unsupported generalization about "the West". And Victor himself is one of the millions of Westerners, and tens of thousands of Western academics, who are not ignorant in any of the relevant ways, so that the comment seemed especially unhelpful in that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Baishui had (for example) written something like "Western academic journals display a shocking ignorance of China, as shown by X, Y, and Z", I would happily have allowed the comment, even if I disagreed with the analysis or the conclusion. If he'd linked to his (as far I know non-existent) blog posts on the subject, and invited us to read them, I'd have been even happier. If he proposed to start a discussion of whether Western academics are more ignorant of China than Chinese academics are of the West, that would be fine with me as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is, his contribution struck me as below the threshold. If he'd like to explain his ideas on the subject in a more contentful way, comments are open.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229422028145"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=917">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7d5dd7a0ab685744</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Phonetics and phonology"/><title type="html">Blagojevich: my bleeping phonological error</title><published>2008-12-16T09:58:37Z</published><updated>2008-12-16T09:58:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=917" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At one point toward the end of my post (&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=914"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) on the Blagojevich affair, I made a bad linguistic mistake.  And on a cute and moderately interesting point.  In brief (I have little time this morning), for unknown reasons but in a fairly well studied way, expletive insertion inside words in English works prosodically only when there is a weak stress somewhere before the insertion point and a strong stress immediately after it: &lt;i&gt;I'm not going to KALama-fuckin'-&lt;b&gt;ZOO&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/i&gt;.  It doesn't work when there is only an unstressed syllable before (so &lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;I'm not going to Chi-fuckin'-&lt;b&gt;CA&lt;/b&gt;go&lt;/i&gt; is nowhere near as good, because &lt;i&gt;Chi-&lt;/i&gt; is too light), and it is hopeless when the stress (say, because it is on the first syllable) has to precede the insertion (*&lt;i&gt;I'm not going to &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;i-fuckin'-lene&lt;/i&gt;).  The remaining details will quite probably be explained here by one of the Language Log phonologists (you could even read quite a bit about the details in a paper by Arnold Zwicky and me, &lt;a href="http://ling.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/pubs.html#1987"&gt;item no. 124 here&lt;/a&gt;).  Here's my mistake: I don't know Serbian, and I get my news mainly from print.  And at the point when I wrote, I thought the name was &lt;i&gt;Blago-JE-vich&lt;/i&gt;.  It isn't.  It's &lt;i&gt;Bla-GO-jevich&lt;/i&gt;.  The readers who have objected in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=916#comments"&gt;comments on Ben's latest post&lt;/a&gt; are correct: I put the insultingly inserted expletive into his name &lt;b&gt;in the wrong place&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;i&gt;Bla&lt;b&gt;GO&lt;/b&gt;fuckinjevich&lt;/i&gt; is completely impossible, for me as well as the commenters who objected.  As properly pronounced, this name has the wrong prosodic shape to work well with an inserted expletive (there isn't enough stress on the syllable before &lt;i&gt;-go&lt;/i&gt;: the &lt;i&gt;Bla-&lt;/i&gt; is basically stressless).  I knew that what I wrote was not great; but given the correct stress position, I made a clear error, by my own judgment, and I would have abandoned the attempt to insert if I had realized where the correct stress went.  I didn&amp;#39;t find out how the name was correctly pronounced before I posted.  This was careless.  I would probably be excoriated by judgmental readers if I opened comments, so I hope my mouse doesn&amp;#39;t slip and hit the &amp;quot;Allow Comments&amp;quot; button by mistake…  Oops!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

To my own dismay I'm partially agreeing with the extremely obnoxious and childish J.P. Holding that Jesus was a historical person who founded the Jesus cult (my view can be found below his on the left side). But, I'm also agreeing with Dr. Frank Zindler of &lt;em&gt;American Atheists&lt;/em&gt;, that the Jesus figure was made up of many mythical elements. My position is a middle one between theirs that fits the data better.  &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I find completely unjustifiable is that Holding accepts all of the elements in the Gospels as historically reliable. And what I find somewhat odd is that Zindler thinks I have the burden of proof (since textual evidence is usually considered good evidence until shown otherwise), and he doesn't present a theory of how such a cultic movement began in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a link just to my arguments &lt;a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/who-is-the-best-candidate-for-starting-the-jesus-movement"&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;, (then click to the right for the next argument, and so forth).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a link just to Dr. Zindler's arguments &lt;a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/evidence-for-a-would-be-messiah-is-shaky"&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;, and do likewise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a link just to Holding's arguments &lt;a href="http://www.opposingviews.com/arguments/tacitus-a-reliable-reference-to-jesus"&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt;, and do likewise. On this site they won't let Holding speak with his usual &lt;em&gt;ad hominems&lt;/em&gt; against people who disagree, or so I was told. That eliminates most of his arguments! ;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

He dreamed, as he later recalled, of &amp;quot;a table where all the elements fell into place as required.&amp;quot; His intuition that when the elements were listed in order of weight, their properties repeated in regular intervals, gave rise to the Periodic Table of the Elements which, though much revised since, underlies modern chemistry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Dmitri Mendeleyev were an astrologer instead of a chemist trying to figure out the meaning of heavenly movements and had a dream about the meanings of the zodiac and the planets along with their meanings could you accept that, like you accept his dream about the periodic table of elements?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e2010536771477970c-pi"&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="234px-Medeleeff_by_repin" border="0" height="172" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105366fa273970b-pi" style="border:0px none;display:inline;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px" title="234px-Medeleeff_by_repin" width="145"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; My emailer was likening the discovery of the periodic table to the discovery of the rules of astrology.  If Mendeleyev could literally dream up the periodic table, then why couldn’t ancient man have dreamed up astrology?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a couple of fundamental problems with this interpretation.  Firstly, the emailer’s (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mendeleyevs-Dream-Elements-Paul-Strathern/dp/0312262043"&gt;copy and pasted&lt;/a&gt;) paragraph actually debunks the argument he is trying to make.  The important wording, that he didn’t notice, is that Dmitri Mendeleyev went to bed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…frustrated by a puzzle he had been playing with for years…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He didn’t just dream up the periodic table out of whole cloth.  There was &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; a problem he was trying to solve, namely to classify the elements according to their chemical properties.  And he finally solved the problem.  Most likely after a good night&amp;#39;s sleep, rather than in a dream.  But whether he literally dreamed it, or whether he just had the answer in the morning, is immaterial.  He had been puzzling over a problem, and eventually found a solution.  Where is the original problem the inventors of astrology were trying to solve?  And where can I read about it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, Mendeleyev’s periodic table made several predictions that later proved to be true.  &lt;a href="http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/periodictable/pre16/develop/mendeleev.htm"&gt;For example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;…not only did he leave spaces for elements that were not yet discovered but he predicted properties of five of these elements and their compounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The missing elements were later proven to exist, exactly as Mendeleyev had predicted.  Contrast that with astrology where not only was there was no problem to be solved, but the &lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/02/what_do_you_mea.html"&gt;predictions of astrology proved false when tested&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s great to “dream up” wild ideas, but unless they can be confirmed by testing, they &lt;strike&gt;will&lt;/strike&gt; should remain just dreams.  Where can I read of how the early astrologers’ predictions came true?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One more thing - the “dream” story is probably a myth anyway.  From the &lt;a href="http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/periodictable/pre16/develop/mendeleev.htm"&gt;same source&lt;/a&gt; I cited above:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were two main problems about establishing a pattern for the elements. First only 60 elements had been discovered (we now know of over 100) and second some of the information about the 60 was wrong. It was if Mendeleev was doing a jigsaw with one third of the pieces missing, and other pieces bent! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mendeleev had written the properties of elements on pieces of card and &lt;strong&gt;tradition has it&lt;/strong&gt; that after organising the cards while playing patience &lt;strong&gt;he suddenly realised&lt;/strong&gt; that by arranging the element cards in order of increasing atomic weight &lt;strong&gt;that certain types of element regularly occurred&lt;/strong&gt;. For example a reactive non-metal was directly followed by a very reactive light metal, then a less reactive light metal. The image of a stamp collectors’ miniature sheet shows a stamp commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the Periodic Table superimposed on some of Mendeleev’s original jottings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(My bold.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right there, we have an example of the sort of thing I’m looking for with astrology.  It turns out my emailer’s attempt to answer my question (strictly speaking, to render it moot), actually proved to be yet another example of how real scientific discoveries are derived.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So again, I’ll ask the proponents of astrology, show me how the detailed rules were derived.  And I mean show me, with evidence, with the data they used, how they calculated it, how they validated it.  Don’t just say (as this emailer also said), that astrology was first conceived when highly intuitive individuals saw a correlation between heavenly movements in the cosmos to their relations here on earth… (etc etc).  Tell me where can I read &lt;em&gt;the details&lt;/em&gt; of how they did this?  The &lt;em&gt;details&lt;/em&gt; of the testing.  Where are they?  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105367714ef970c-pi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105366fa7e2970b-pi"&gt;&lt;img alt="800px-Periodic_table.svg" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105366fa7e2970b-800wi" title="800px-Periodic_table.svg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Dreading what I’ll see, I open it. Sure enough, incredible new images from Cassini, just when I’ve finalized my Top Ten list! Arg! I peruse them anyway, and then find this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3111113577/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/3111113577_229e1005f3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click it. I dare you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5310/A_Tectonic_Feast"&gt;That’s Enceladus&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny water-ice moon orbiting Saturn. The ridges and cracks are ice floes, not too different from what you see on the Earth’s north pole. Note that there’s no solid land under our terrestrial arctic region, and for the same reason we think that Enceladus is actually a global ocean covered with floating ice. The lack of craters is because there are few old features on the moon. The shifting floes erase anything that isn’t young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image is spectacular (and &lt;a href="http://ciclops.org/view/5310/A_Tectonic_Feast"&gt;a much higher-res version is at the Cassini CICLOPS site&lt;/a&gt;). It was taken as Cassini flew past Enceladus, creating a mosaic of incredible resolution. It’s composed of 28 separate images using seven different camera positions on the surface (called footprints), with four different filters used at each footprint. Cassini ranged from 30,000 - 48,000 km (19,000 - 30,000 miles) from the moon’s surface while the images were taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the bottom you can see the Tiger Stripes, cracks in the surface (called sulci) which are the sources of water geysers detected previously by Cassini. The cause of the geysers is still under debate, but it’s known that the geysers are noticeably warmer than the rest of the Enceladan surface. The material spewed out &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/03/26/lifes-cauldron-may-be-bubbling-underneath-enceladus/"&gt;contains organic materials&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, water and organic materials, and a known mechanism (tidal heating) to keep the water liquid, and to help mix it. Provocative, isn’t it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, we’ll have to plumb the depths of this little moon. Until then, though, we have the Cassini mission still making its rounds of Saturn, and still patrolling its army of moons, returning gorgeous images and even more surprising science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as far as my Top Ten list goes… I will &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; reluctantly leave this one off, because I don’t want you to wait to see it. Think of this as &amp;quot;Number -1&amp;quot;, a taste of what’s to come. &lt;/p&gt;

There is some metered street parking in the area. If you are patient and diligent, you can find it.  There is also a parking garage for Childrens Memorial Hospital  just north of the bar. I believe weekend parking is $12. It’s also easy to get to via CTA.&lt;/p&gt;

Blogchild Mark Chu-Carroll takes on our favorite creationist neurosurgeon, Dr. Egnor. This time he deals directly with something I've &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/facepalm_thy_name_is_dr_egnor.php"&gt;touched upon&lt;/a&gt; recently: Egnor's false labeling of the theory of evolution as a tautology.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wait, I mean me!

&lt;p&gt;Randi makes an appearance later as well. If you don’t listen to SGU, well, you should.

&lt;p&gt;No, not really, but this is still a cool result: investigators have used an MRI to read images off the visual cortex. They presented subjects with some simple symbols and letters, scanned their brains, and read off the image from the data — and it was even legible! Here are some examples of, first, the images presented to the subjects, then a set of individual patterns from the cortex read in single measurements, and then, finally, the average of the single scans. I think you can all read the word &amp;quot;neuron&amp;quot; in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="mri_signals.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/15/mri_signals.jpeg" width="425" height="326"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reconstructed visual images. The reconstruction results of all trials for two subjects are shown with the presented images from the ﬁgure image session. The 
reconstructed images are sorted in ascending order of the mean square error. For the purpose of illustration, each patch is depicted by a homogeneous square, 
whose intensity represents the contrast of the checkerboard pattern. Each reconstructed image was produced from the data of a single trial, and no postprocessing was applied. The mean images of the reconstructed images are presented at the bottom row. The same images of the alphabet letter ''n'' are displayed in 
the rightmost and leftmost columns.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you get all panicky and worry that now the CIA will be able to extract all of those sexy librarian fantasies out of your brain by aiming a gadet at your head, relax. This is an interesting piece of work, but it has some serious limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This only works because they are scanning the part of the visual cortex that exhibits retinotopy — a direct mapping of the spatial arrangement of the retina (and thus, of any images falling on it) onto a patch of the brain at the back of your head. This won&amp;#39;t work for just about any other modality, except probably touch, and I doubt it will work for visualization/cognition/memory, which are all much more derived and much more complexly stored. Although I&amp;#39;d really like to know if someone closes their eyes and merely &lt;i&gt;imagines&lt;/i&gt; a letter "E", for instance, whether there isn't some activation of the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process was time consuming. Subjects were first recorded while staring at random noise for 6 seconds in 22 trials. This was necessary to get an image of the background noise of the brain, wwhich was subtracted from subsequent image measurements. The brain is a noisy place, and the letter pattern is superimposed on a lot of background variation. Then, finally, the subject has to fixate on the test image for 12 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a fair amount of math has to be flung at the scan to extract the contrast information. This is probably the least of the obstacles, since computational power seems to increase fairly rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give this research some more time, though, and I can imagine some uses for being able to record specific aspects of brain states. I&amp;#39;d be more interested in a device that can read pre-motor cortex though — I&amp;#39;d like to get rid of this clumsy keyboard someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behold, &lt;a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=hr110-847"&gt;House Resolution 847&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. Res. 847&lt;br&gt;
In the House of Representatives, U. S.,&lt;br&gt;
December 11, 2007.&lt;br&gt;
Whereas Christmas, a holiday of great significance to Americans and many other cultures and nationalities, is celebrated annually by Christians throughout the United States and the world;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas there are approximately 225,000,000 Christians in the United States, making Christianity the religion of over three-fourths of the American population;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas there are approximately 2,000,000,000 Christians throughout the world, making Christianity the largest religion in the world and the religion of about one-third of the world population;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas Christians and Christianity have contributed greatly to the development of western civilization;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas the United States, being founded as a constitutional republic in the traditions of western civilization, finds much in its history that points observers back to its Judeo-Christian roots;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas on December 25 of each calendar year, American Christians observe Christmas, the holiday celebrating the birth of their savior, Jesus Christ;&lt;br&gt;
Whereas for Christians, Christmas is celebrated as a recognition of God's redemption, mercy, and Grace; and&lt;br&gt;
Whereas many Christians and non-Christians throughout the United States and the rest of the world, celebrate Christmas as a time to serve others: Now, therefore, be it&lt;br&gt;
Resolved, That the House of Representatives--&lt;br&gt;
(1) recognizes the Christian faith as one of the great religions of the world;&lt;br&gt;
(2) expresses continued support for Christians in the United States and worldwide;&lt;br&gt;
(3) acknowledges the international religious and historical importance of Christmas and the Christian faith;&lt;br&gt;
(4) acknowledges and supports the role played by Christians and Christianity in the founding of the United States and in the formation of the western civilization;&lt;br&gt;
(5) rejects bigotry and persecution directed against Christians, both in the United States and worldwide; and&lt;br&gt;
(6) expresses its deepest respect to American Christians and Christians throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robbing a house, or &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/13/burglar-i-was-held-captiv_n_150807.html"&gt;getting caught because a ghost wouldn’t let you leave&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing it’s that second part. Even dumber, when they found him he was suffering dehydration. Or maybe he was already on the brink of it when he robbed the house, which is why he thought it was haunted. Beats me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we hear ghost stories all the time. As I (and lots of others, of course) have long been saying, there is no credible evidence of ghosts. None. Zip. Like with UFOs, if you want to convince me of this, I want &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; evidence. Not a blurry photo, or video of a spider crawling on a surveillance camera. &lt;em&gt;Evidence&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would also help &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oe-klinghoffer8-2008dec08,0,6410009.story"&gt;if people like David Klinghoffer didn’t apologize for belief in the supernatural&lt;/a&gt;.  His opinion piece in the L.A. Times has some good points, but is way too credulous of the possibility of the paranormal. He dismissed brain-related effects explaining the belief in paranormal as too much like &amp;quot;just-so stories&amp;quot;, and being unfalsifiable. Mr Klinghoffer, if you read this: there have been tests that show this effect to occur. Magnetic effects to the temporal lobe can induce all sorts of paranormal-like feelings. While this is not a sufficient explanation, it certainly is far more than a just-so story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I know stories like the one about the goofball burglar will continue on forever. As a rational person, I know that we will never be an &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; rational species. My hope is that we can &lt;em&gt;minimize&lt;/em&gt; our irrationality… especially when it comes to our voters, our politicians, our editors, our writers, and anyone else in positions of power or the ability to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;

"When people are shaken to the core, it can open doors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, you might wonder, could possibly be driving more people into the shoutin' and yellin' and hellfire churches? Why, it's the economic downturn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I found it very exciting, and I called up that fellow to tell him so," said the Rev. Don MacKintosh, a Seventh Day Adventist televangelist in California who contacted Dr. Beckworth a few weeks ago after hearing word of his paper from another preacher. "We need to leverage this moment, because &lt;b&gt;every Christian revival in this country's history has come off a period of rampant greed and fear&lt;/b&gt;. That's what we're in today -- the time of fear and greed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, fervent Christians overjoyed at the poverty and hardship their congregations are suffering … I&amp;#39;m not surprised. Not surprised at all. And the worse the economy gets, the more these parasites will prosper.&lt;/p&gt;

Quite true. On the other hand, Americans have gotten so used to reading between the bleeps that it's still possible to appreciate (and satirize) Blago's coarseness in censored mode. Nightly satirists like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have already taken their shots, and now Saturday Night Live plays on his bleepability.  [We had a link to the video here, but it has been killed off by an NBC copyright claim.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In other news on the bleeping front, the New York Times &lt;a href="http://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/the-bleepin-ascendancy/"&gt;Ideas blog&lt;/a&gt; notes that "bleep" itself is now on the ascendancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like “bleep” is now its own bleeping punch line thanks to those expletive-laced wiretaps of the Blagojeviches released this week. John McCain joking on “Letterman” Thursday: “I don’t want to talk about the bleeping campaign. Understand? If you think I’m going to go back to that bleeping situation, then bleep you.” The columnist Jonah Goldberg: “There are so many bleeping things to love about this bleeping-bleep Blagojevich scandal it’s hard to know where to begin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-talk-languagedec14,0,7604868.story"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt; riffs on David Letterman's joke that the Illinois governor was charged with "one count of bribery, one count of fraud and one count of Blagojeviching." They suggest the following "working definition" for the new eponym:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blagojevich &lt;/strong&gt;(bluh-GOY-uh-vich) &lt;strong&gt;noun&lt;/strong&gt;. a scandalous person —&lt;strong&gt;verb 1&lt;/strong&gt; to damage or cheapen &lt;strong&gt;2 &lt;/strong&gt;to complain —&lt;strong&gt;adj., adv.&lt;/strong&gt; [Vulgar Slang] &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; bleeping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm quoted in the Tribune piece as saying that it's unlikely that a verbing of Blagojevich would catch on (unlike, say, &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002594.html"&gt;Borking&lt;/a&gt;) because it's just too hard to say. But I like the idea of "Blagojevich" becoming a stand-in for the usual bleep of taboo avoidance. The Trib quotes one Chicago blogger: "I'm so blagojeviching blagojevich about Blagojevich." Hmm, shades of this classic cinematic moment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About four years ago, I discussed an article in the NYT that dealt (in a confused and confusing way) with issues of endangered language preservation, mother-tongue literacy, and computer access in Africa ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001640.html"&gt;African language computer farrago&lt;/a&gt;", 11/13/2004). The featured project was &lt;a href="http://www.elearning-africa.com/newsportal/english/news56_print.php"&gt;Tunde Adegbola&lt;/a&gt;'s work with the &lt;a href="http://www.alt-i.org/index.htm"&gt;African Languages Technology Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (ALT-i).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post on the &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/yorubaaffairs/browse_thread/thread/7093a6a65c107e26"&gt;Yoruba Affairs newsgroup&lt;/a&gt;, which I subscribe to, recently announced that (a draft of?) the &lt;a href="http://www.pinigeria.org/microsoft/yorubaglossary.pdf"&gt;Yoruba Glossary for Microsoft's Language Interface Pack&lt;/a&gt; has just been released, as a partnership between ALT-i and &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/About/CorporateCitizenship/US/CommunityInvestment/CommunityTechSkills.mspx"&gt;Microsoft Unlimited Potential&lt;/a&gt; (whose acronym is, of course, "UP", not "MUP"). At 196 pages and 2000-3000 terms, this is a substantial document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to my 2004 post about the confused NYT article, Bill Poser &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001641.html"&gt;added some background&lt;/a&gt; about localization efforts in general, and registered a complaint about Microsoft "not localizing their software when they didn't see enough profit in it". But in fairness to Microsoft, they've had a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/vista/Whats_New_Vista.mspx"&gt;large and effective localization effort&lt;/a&gt; for many years. They've certainly done much more than other computer companies have done, and in this case, perhaps more than the free software community has done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://wazobialinux.com/"&gt;Wazobia Linux&lt;/a&gt; is a distribution with (some programs?) localized in Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo. But it is apparently not actually free — only a demo version can be downloaded from the company&amp;#39;s site, and those interested in the full version are invited to contact the company by email to discuss prices. The &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://wazobialinux.com/wheretobuy.html"&gt;where to buy&lt;/a&gt;" link is "currently under construction", and the &lt;a href="http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=wazobia"&gt;Wazobia page&lt;/a&gt; at DistroWatch.com characterized this distribution as &amp;quot;dormant&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t know of any other Linux distributions with a significant amount of localization in Yoruba — for example, the Yoruba pages for &lt;a href="http://l10n.kde.org/team-infos.php?teamcode=yo"&gt;KDE localization&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href="http://mdk.jack.kiev.ua/stats/gui/trunk/team/yo/"&gt;Mandriva Tools localization&lt;/a&gt; don't show very much progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe Wilcox at eWeek &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/why_is_microsofts_unlimited_potential.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; why Microsoft might want to get out ahead of the OSS movement in serving less developed regions, quoting Roger Kay of Endpoint Technologies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth noting that selling software at $3 a pop to the next billion is pretty good business …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, not all software sold in the developing world will be (or is) so inexpensive. On this analysis, Microsoft Unlimited Potential is a response to the possibility that the open-source software movement and initiatives like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_laptop_per_child"&gt;OLPC&lt;/a&gt; might otherwise succeed in locking up large potential markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own opinion is that this competition is very much to the benefit of the people whose future software and hardware use is in play — though this opinion depends on the judgment that none of the competitors is likely to succeed in driving all the others out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[And while we&amp;#39;re discussing software support for the world&amp;#39;s languages, let me note that the latest Firefox on the latest Ubuntu Linux — which I&amp;#39;m using at the moment to enter this post — &lt;strong&gt;still does the Wrong Thing&lt;/strong&gt; in rendering Unicode 0323 "COMBINING DOT BELOW", as I discussed long ago ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000616.html"&gt;Them old diacritical blues again&lt;/a&gt;", 3/21/2004).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the tiniest of the many problems in text rendered caused by the Unicode Consortium's policy of "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000669.html"&gt;Convenience for the Wealthy, Virtue for the Poor&lt;/a&gt;". Microsoft solved this simple problem years ago, and has since dealt with most of the long tail of more difficult issues in &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000220.html"&gt;complex rendering&lt;/a&gt;. It's nothing short of a scandal that software providers can't get their act together to deal with the relatively simple problem of rendering diacritics on latin-alphabet characters. (Yes, I know that some software packages do the right thing. But it's discouraging that so many software/OS/font combinations don't.) ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Stephen Norris has written to me to point out that the wrong treatment of Unicode 02323 &amp;quot;COMBINING DOT BELOW&amp;quot; by some browser/font combinations, in my post &amp;quot;Them old diacritical blues again&amp;quot;, 3/21/2004, is in fact mostly the fault of the fonts — some fonts insist on putting the dot in the wrong place in ways that the rendering program is pretty much powerless to fix, probably as a result of years of accommodating rendering programs that do nothing at all. But this just confirms my opinion that we are still seeing the trail of damage from the Unicode consortium&amp;#39;s hypocritical  policies about combining diacritics on Latin characters — to provide precomposed versions for sufficiently powerful constituencies, while insisting that others must be virtuous and wait for rendering engines to get around to doing the combinations on the fly, in the Right Way. Since the powerful constituencies don&amp;#39;t need such rendering, software and font developers have little incentive to get around to doing things the Right Way.  For a user&amp;#39;s perspective on this situation, see the section  under the heading &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.e-ternals.com/nanos/data.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why Nanos uses precomposite Greek characters in preference over composite ones&lt;/a&gt;" in the documentation for the Greek text editor Nanos (towards the bottom of the cited page).]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229359237434"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/once_again_egnor_and_tautologi.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/f48ec519c70bb5be</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Egnorance"/><title type="html">Once again, Egnor and Tautologies</title><published>2008-12-15T16:07:54Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T16:07:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/485692359/once_again_egnor_and_tautologi.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/once_again_egnor_and_tautologi.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;p&gt; As you've probably heard from other ScienceBlogger's, that paragon of
arrogant ignorance, Dr. Michael Egnor, is back at it again - and he's abusing
the language of logic in a way that really frustrates me. I've written
about this before, but the general topic recently came up in comments, so
I thought I'd bump it up to the top, along with another slap aimed at Egnor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; For those who don't know, Dr. Egnor is a brain surgeon at SUNY Stonybrook - an excellent school, and Dr. Egnor is, from all information I've heard, an outstanding surgeon. In his free time, he blogs for the Discovery Institute, using his
status as an accomplished brain-surgeon to try to boost the bullshit spewing out of DI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of Dr. Egnor's favorite attacks in his anti-evolution screeds always makes me think of a line from one of my favorite movies: "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die".  Oops, no, not that one. (Sorry, couldn't resist.) The real line is "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; You see, what Egnor keeps doing, over and over again, is arguing that 
evolution is just a tautology, and that therefore it's meaningless. He
defines evolution as the statement "that which survives, survives". He almost never gets through one of his posts without that accusation in one form or another: evolution is a tautology, and that implies that it's meaningless and worthless as an explanation of anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Leave aside for the moment the fact that he &lt;em&gt;mis-states&lt;/em&gt; the key premise of evolution. That's a huge, obvious, and &lt;em&gt;deliberate&lt;/em&gt; mistake, but let's just ignore it for now. Instead, I'd like to just look at the problem with his statement about tautologies. What exactly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a tautology? And does
criticizing something as "just a tautology" actually make any sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is too cool! Beagle Rupes is a fault scarp, a cliff created by a fault line. It cuts right across the crater &lt;a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/gallery/sciencePhotos/image.php?page=2&amp;amp;gallery_id=2&amp;amp;image_id=191"&gt;Sveinsdóttir&lt;/a&gt;, an elongated impact probably due to a very low-angle collision by an asteroid or comet on the planet’s surface. The crater is 600 km long, which is incredible. The fault obviously happened later, splitting the crater in two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren’t too many Mercury anaglyphs (unlike Mars), but just you wait until 2011, when MESSENGER settles into orbit around the solar system’s smallest planet. Then we’ll get a ton of pictures like this one, and the amount we’ll learn about Mercury will be phenomenal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229358403609"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4739">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a4528bb49ee25c3f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion &amp; Spirituality"/><category term="Skepchick-ism"/><title type="html">And Soon the Whole World is Blind</title><published>2008-12-15T16:06:34Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T16:06:34Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4739" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, Skepchick commenter QuestioningAuthority sent us &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/12/14/iran.acid.justice/index.html"&gt;this article from CNN&lt;/a&gt;, reporting that an Iranian man who blinded a woman with acid has been sentenced to a similar fate as his victim: he’ll be blinded, and his eyes removed. In his note to us, QA asked, “Appropriate or not? Justice or not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to here what you all think. In the meantime, here’s what I think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For far too long, marring and disabling women with acid has been a gut-churning trend in south Asia and the Middle East, particularly in fundamentalist communities with a long history of hatred against women. Women who dare to show more than a strip of skin, &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13760338"&gt;who think for themselves&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;amp;art=13751"&gt;who desire to educate themselves&lt;/a&gt;, are all punished, usually by rogue vigilantes committed to protecting their backwards, ignorant way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often, the men who abuse women in these societies go unpunished, so a story like this may be seen as a step forward – a man receiving exactly what he deserves, at last. The victim in this case clearly feels as though this is the correct punishment – she says that she didn’t ask that her assailant be physically scarred with acid as she was, because that would be barbaric. She only wants his eyes removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rarely is it so clear to me how relative traits like “barbarism” can be. To me, the attacker was barbaric, and the courts will be barbaric as well when they exact their revenge. To a lesser extent, the victim’s mother was barbaric, for pushing the victim and her attacker toward an arranged marriage without the victim’s consent. And what of those among the man’s family, and friends, and teachers, who raised him to believe that a woman is a piece of property to request or to take? What of the Iranian government officials, &lt;a href="http://www.lastsuperpower.net/docs/woman-iran1"&gt;whose constitution&lt;/a&gt; states a murdered woman is literally worth half a murdered man when charging the murderer? Whose constitution demands a woman leaving the house without a hejab be lashed? Whose constitution bans women from higher office? Will any of that change with this decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will blinding one man who is the product of this society benefit anyone at all?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229357924696"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33265747.post-2301098358069797896">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/136da4e24329ed5e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Paranormalists Are Running Out of Ideas" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Bullshit" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Fisking" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Paranormalists Are Running Out of Ideas: Crossover Edition</title><published>2008-12-15T09:35:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T09:35:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/11/paranormalists-are-running-out-of-ideas.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="html">When I was a kid, I loved "Ripley's Believe It or Not!" The libraries of every school I went to were chock full of musty old collections of his famous one-panel comics stuffed into the extreme low end of the Dewey Decimal System. The smell of the yellowed pages always gave me a headache, but the hundreds of supposed "facts" crammed into every weatherbeaten volume gave me a rush.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Robert Ripley was pretty full of it. His stories were a combination of stuff that was actually true, stuff he had heard (or thought he'd heard) somewhere second- or thirdhand, and stuff he just made up. He didn't exactly go out on a limb to verify the stuff he published as reality, but for an eleven-year-old, that craziness (and all of it &lt;i&gt;true!&lt;/i&gt;) was &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does this have to do with paranormalists and their silly, worst-of-the-worst ideas? Well, a couple of weeks ago, I was browsing paranormal websites looking for something new and ridiculous to post about, but nothing was leaping out at me. Then I remembered something I had read in an old Ripley's collection as a kid. It was the claim that bigfoot had been seen in the vicinity of UFOs a couple of times, and some people believed the two &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2008/05/phenomenon-thing.html"&gt;phenomena&lt;/a&gt; were related.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spin of the Googlemeter later, and I knew I had my post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ripley made some (okay, maybe &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; of) stuff up, but apparently he wasn't bullshitting us when he said that some people think that bigfoot and alien spacecraft are somehow linked. Don't believe me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://backyardphenomena.wordpress.com/2008/04/12/the-synchronicity-of-bigfoot-and-ufos/"&gt;You&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://backyardphenomena.wordpress.com/2008/04/13/the-synchronicity-of-bigfoot-and-ufos-part-2/"&gt;should&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first link is titled "The Synchronicity of Bigfoot and UFOs" and the second is a Part 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The writer of these pieces has, first and foremost, fallen into the Jungian trap of terming any random coincidence in which she perceives a subjective meaning "&lt;a href="http://www.skepdic.com/jung.html"&gt;synchronicity&lt;/a&gt;," and thus imparting upon it a sort of metaphysical significance that is completely at odds with what really happened (i.e. a coincidence).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This really doesn't affect the writing, however, because she appears to be using "synchronicity" improperly. It's kind of like drawing the ninja turtles and accidentally giving Michelangelo kunai instead of nunchaku, but it's wrong nonetheless. What she's talking about is repeated sightings of bigfoot and UFOs at the same time; either bigfoot around UFOs, bigfoot exiting a UFO, or even bigfoot riding around inside a UFO. She then asks "At what point does coincidence become absurdity?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not an argument about synchronicity. Synchronicity would be seeing bigfoot while on a road trip from Ohio to California and remembering that in the classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West," the Monkey King and his friends faced many tribulations while they made their way to India, and that your own road trip fits the archetype of the heroic quest they undertook, so you should maintain your composure and keep an eye out for problems on the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synchronicity is, on some level, like doing literary analysis of real life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seeing bigfoot with or around UFOs over and over again and asking if there is a connection is not synchronicity. It is looking for a reason the two events would be so often correlated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SUYihJH-RwI/AAAAAAAAAgc/m0EeTkusNMo/s1600-h/Bigfoot_UFO.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:320px;height:240px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SUYihJH-RwI/AAAAAAAAAgc/m0EeTkusNMo/s320/Bigfoot_UFO.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I ask, of course, what reason we have to believe that bigfoot and UFOs are being sighted together. Her evidence?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;More and more witnesses report encounters with both Bigfoot and UFOs—though the encounters occur separately.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So...I just take her word for it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really, that's it. That's the only thing she says about people actually seeing bigfoot and UFOs together. The rest is pointless justification for ignoring "rational explanations" and misuse of the word "synchronicity." Like the following gem:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Now imagine I’ve just set an egg on the counter when a glowing orb flies through the kitchen. I watch the orb flit out the window, out of sight, then I look down to discover the egg has broken. Nothing touched the egg, it hasn’t moved, and nothing fell on it. But the egg broke precisely when the orb flew through the kitchen. The events seem related; however, I cannot prove the orb caused the egg to break. I could formulate a dozen explanations for what happened to the egg, explanations which deny the orb affected the egg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The explanations might sound reasonable. But I’m left with one big problem: no egg before or since has ever broken when lying undisturbed on the counter. In situations like this, rational explanations begin to strain the boundaries of the definition for rational.&lt;/blockquote&gt;"Now imagine a situation in which something totally anomalous happens, and my claims might be justified. My claims are therefore justified."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bigfoot and UFOs? Seriously? How deep do you have to dig to connect the two? Why would you want to?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't help but think of lameass pop-culture crossovers, from the Marvel vs. DC comics of the 90s to the "Spider-Man/Red Sonja" miniseries that was released earlier this year. There's a novel out there where the USS Enterprise from TNG gets sucked back in time and meets up with the X-Men. I shit you not. What about 2005's animated "Batman vs. Dracula?" The old horror films that would pit Frankenstein against the wolfman, or the mummy against the creature from the black lagoon? These are all incredibly lame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crossover stories, along with clones and time travel, are the last bastion of the creatively bankrupt. When someone publishes a "Superman vs. Darth Vader" story, you know they've run out of good ideas. Crossovers are contrived and worthless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is why I can't help but laugh ironically at the desperateness it takes to link two phenomena for which there is no good evidence and seriously claim they are related. It's like a conversation between Beavis and Butthead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Butthead: Hey, Beavis, you know bigfoot?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beavis: Uhh...The monster truck?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Butthead: No, dude, the bigfoot. Like, the giant hairy thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beavis: Umm...Oh yeah. Heh heh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Butthead: What if, like, he was an alien who, like, came out of those UFO things?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beavis: Mmm...Oh yeah! That would &lt;i&gt;rock&lt;/i&gt;, Butthead. Heh heh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Butthead: It would be like, he's all hairy and stuff, but he's, like, from space. Like ALF.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beavis: Yeah, heh heh, he's all like "I come from space! I come to...Uh...I come to...Umm..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Butthead: Shut up, Beavis. Uh huh huh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the level of intellect it takes to say "Bigfoot + UFOs = REAL."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But our intrepid crosser-over is &lt;a href="http://backyardphenomena.wordpress.com/2008/04/24/the-synchronicity-of-bigfoot-and-glowing-orbs/"&gt;not done yet&lt;/a&gt;. That one begins:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I’ve discussed this idea before, concerning Bigfoot and UFOs. The two phenomena will occur in the same small geographic area at different times. Often, the same witnesses will see both phenomena. A connection exists—but one which traditional science cannot explain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;How in the fuck is "traditional science" unable to explain this proposed "connection?" &lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; bigfoot existed and &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; UFOs were some sort of alien craft or supernatural being and &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; they were consistently spotted together, then it would be trivial for &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; to theorize a connection. Science doesn't even have to enter into it. You don't need to appeal to metaphysics and other ways of knowing to find an explanation for "A and B are always hanging out together."&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If we delve into a particular type of UFO phenomenon, we can find even more synchronicities. What phenomenon?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glowing orbs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Orbs! Orbs! This is immense. It is taking &lt;a href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/2007/06/paranormalists-are-running-out-of-ideas.html"&gt;one piece of evidence that paranormalists are running out of ideas&lt;/a&gt; and using it to fuel another. It's like compound megawoo; by their powers combined, it is Captain Lame. Let's continue:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While some witnesses have seen glowing orbs with Bigfoot, the two phenomena also clearly share a synchronicity. They occur in the same small area at different times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Again, &lt;i&gt;this is not even synchronicity&lt;/i&gt;. Synchronicity requires a coincidence that a person reads as meaningful and thus believes has &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; meaning. This is just dot-connecting with no "deeper level" of meaning, something that is part of the definition of synchronicity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What it really is, though, is finding questionable connections between events of questionable veracity. This author seems to believe that human perception is infallible, that people never lie, and that something is whatever someone thinks it is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, the BPI sightings collection includes a report of two brothers who saw three Bigfoot (possibly an adult with two juveniles) near Paulding, Michigan. Where’s the synchronicity? Paulding also hosts a mystery light—an orb-type occurrence which happens every night along an old logging road.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The number of unfounded assumptions is staggering. Off the top of my head I have the following: (1)Bigfoot exists. (2)"Orbs" are something supernatural. (2)The people that reported the bigfoot sighting were not lying. (4)The people who reported the bigfoot sighting actually saw bigfoot and were not mistaken. (5)The "mystery light" exists. (6)The "mystery light" has no natural explanation. (6)People who see the "mystery light" are not just lying or mistaken. (6)There is a connection between bigfoot and orbs in Paulding, MI, because someone once saw bigfoot and people think they've seen a "mystery light."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you can think of any more, feel free to point them out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The point I'm getting at is that, in addition to being irrational, this is just &lt;i&gt;retarded&lt;/i&gt;. It's someone who desperately wants the supernatural to be real finding whatever thread-thin connections can possibly be perceived to link the disparate, unrelated parts of the nonsense into a connected whole. It's like bigfoot/alien/ghost fanfiction, except written in all earnestness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you fucking kidding me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, as incredibly stupid as this all is, I'm not done yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pinewindspress.com/bigfoot.htm"&gt;This person has something else to say about bigfoot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Specifically, that&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They are real, but something other than flesh and blood, spirits similar to angels, but with a lot more hair.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Bigfoot is a magical spirit! He's like the Green Man of the forest! He is neither hominid nor hoax, but an angelic creature that only &lt;i&gt;looks&lt;/i&gt; like a man in an ape costume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We tend to favor [that explanation] because we don't think every one of the thousands of people who have seen a Bigfoot are mistaken or lying and because the physical evidence has not been found.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah, cuz it's &lt;i&gt;mean&lt;/i&gt; to call people liars, you meanies!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is like bigfoot apologetics! "Of course there's no &lt;i&gt;physical&lt;/i&gt; evidence, because bigfoot is like a woods spirit, man, and he manifests to people with the right vibes, but since he's all spiritual like an angel, he doesn't leave a trace."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SUYjCUT1K5I/AAAAAAAAAgk/rp10HqZGdVU/s1600-h/bigfoot2+comprezssed+tnail.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block;margin:0px auto 10px;text-align:center;width:240px;height:230px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_9waYmU99QAA/SUYjCUT1K5I/AAAAAAAAAgk/rp10HqZGdVU/s400/bigfoot2+comprezssed+tnail.jpg" border="0" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But it isn't even &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; bigfoot apologetics, because it ignores the evidence claimed by &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; bigfoot devotees, like the ever-present giant footprints that gave rise to the name in the first damn place. These bigfoot hippies need to call &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; bigfoot believers frauds because of their particular metaphysical model of bigfoot!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So they don't want to call people who &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; bigfoot liars, but they're bound by their belief to the claim that all bigfoot hunters with plaster casts of footprints are liars. Methinks they did not think this one through too much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their evidence is a story where a woman hears a noise on her porch and grabs her shotgun, only to find a bigfoot outside the door. She shoots it and it disappears ni a flash of light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No attribution is given to the story. It might as well be made up out of whole cloth. What is it about people like this who, when faced with some unbelievable story, come up with ways, no matter how ridiculous, to &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Bigfoot is interesting because we think it is another intelligent and self-directed manifestation of the life force with its own rules of existence. When we study the life force, we need to make our theories large enough for even Bigfoot to fit in.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Why? Why not just say he's a yet-undiscovered hominid? Why mix your woo? Why feel the need to bring together all of your erroneous beliefs into one extra-retarded whole?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know people are pattern-seeking apes who just love making connections even when there are none. This crap, however, is a whole new level. It's making faulty connections &lt;i&gt;about faulty connections&lt;/i&gt;. Finding false patterns &lt;i&gt;made out of other false patterns&lt;/i&gt;. These people are so pathetically hooked on paranormal nonsense that they connect it all regardless of how much sense it makes, and throw around words like "synchronicity" as if that makes it okay. "Bigfoot is fringe pseudoscience. Alien abductions are fringe pseudoscience. Ghosts and spirits are fringe pseudoscience. There must be an important connection!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately they fail to see that the only connection that matters is that none of these ideas are backed up by any reliable scientific evidence. They aren't fringe pseudoscience because they're connected somehow; they're connected &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; they are all fringe pseudoscience. Is it that hard for these people to understand?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, further perusal of the synchronicity blog shows that the author also believes in fairies. Fucking &lt;i&gt;fairies&lt;/i&gt;. A few minutes on that website is enough to reveal that she is an arrogant, know-nothing imbecile who simply believes whatever the hell she wants to believe and has far too high an opinion of her own intellect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's sad sacks like this that show, once again, that paranormalists are running out of ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://res1.blogblog.com/tracker/33265747-2301098358069797896?l=actionskeptics.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229357372961"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3374680600148695118">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5aed922f4b272f82</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Response to Dr. Blomberg</title><published>2008-12-16T04:58:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T17:13:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/485470566/response-to-dr-blomberg.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/3374680600148695118/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=3374680600148695118" title="15 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/response-to-dr-blomberg.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">Dr. Blomberg’s view of altruism is flawed in light of recent primatological research&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thank Dr. Blomberg for posting his commentary on Debunking Christianity.  Here, I would like to respond to his argument for theism based on altruism. In addition to being a trained biblical scholar, I am also formally trained as an anthropologist (B.A., University of Arizona, 1982 + 1 year of graduate work). I have had a longstanding interest in the evolution of morality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Dr. Blomberg’s post seems uninformed about crucial advances taking place in primatology as well as in neurobiology, which can explain altruistic behavior. I begin with this remark from Dr. Blomberg:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;"What about the sheer altruism, utterly unmotivated by self-interest, which leads firefighters to sacrifice their lives by running back into towering infernos? Only the concept of humans made in the image of God can account for that in my estimation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In one of the responses he adds:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;"The most advanced of apes has never disclosed any awareness of systems of morality, which is why we never arrest and imprison them, even if they kill humans."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; His example about human beings not imprisoning apes is not only factually incorrect (we do "imprison," kill, or separate apes who hurt human beings), but also overlooks that the human beings he describes may not be informed about recent primatological research. Otherwise, these are the problems with Dr. Blomberg’s argument:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;1. It relies on a God-of-the-Gaps argument. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Blomberg suggests that since we don’t have a naturalistic explanation for altruism, then this should be relegated to the actions of God.  Historically, such arguments have been overturned repeatedly.  We can name literally hundreds of phenomena once thought to be supernatural, but which were subsequently overturned by completely naturalistic explanations.  Everything from lightning to earthquakes were once thought to have supernatural origins before we discovered naturalistic explanations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The reverse has never been the case to my knowledge. That is to say, I don’t know of any case where a naturalistic explanation has been replaced by an indisputably supernaturalistic one. The replacement of natural explanations by indisputably supernatural explanations has batted a zero in history. Given such a track record, therefore, it is reasonable to posit that altruism is no less naturalistic than any other phenomenon observed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;2. We do have observations of animals who act to save other individuals even when it imperils their lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;One recent dramatic case was in Santiago, Chile, where a dog rushed into traffic and dragged to safety another dog lying on the road.  See video here: &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/03/dog-saves-other-injured-d_n_148238.html?show_comment_id=18618323"&gt;Dog saves Dog in Traffic &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;Can Dr. Blomberg explain why a dog would do such a thing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;3. Recent and very rigorous primatological research shows that greater apes do have  a sense of what we might call “morality.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;Crucial here is the research of Frans de Waal, Professor of Primate Behavior in the Department of Psychology at Emory University.  Frans de Waal has brought a methodological and experimental rigor to primate behavioral research that provides good controls.  Overall, de Waal’s research shows  a continuity between higher ape “moral” behavior and that of human beings (as opposed to previous theorists who think human moral behavior is completely unique and/or an innovation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In some cases (e.g., food sharing behavior), his data sets have involved upwards of 7,000 interactions (see de Waal. “Food Sharing and Reciprocal Obligations Among Chimpanzees.” &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/span&gt; 18 [1989]:433-459).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In addition, to his important books (&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Good Natured: The Origin of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals&lt;/span&gt; [1996] and &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved&lt;/span&gt; [2006]), I would suggest his following technical articles:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S. F. Brosnan and F. B. M. de Waal. Monkeys Reject Unequal Pay.&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt; 425 (2003):297-299.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;F. B. M. de Waal and A. van Roosmalen. Reconciliation and Consolation&lt;br&gt; among Chimpanzees. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; 5 (1979):55-66.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let me just briefly summarize the results of some of these experiments. In the article in &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt;, Dr. de Waal devised elegant experiments showing that capuchin monkeys do have a sense of fairness.  For example, capuchin monkeys might reject a food reward of less value if they observe other monkeys receiving food of higher value for performing the same task.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Just as compelling are the earlier experiments showing that Rhesus monkeys refuse to pull a chain that delivered food to themselves if pulling the chain shocked other monkeys.  Some monkeys were willing to starve if getting food for themselves meant hurting other monkeys.  See: J. Masserman. M. S. Wechkin and W. Terris. Altruistic Behavior in Rhesus Monkeys. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/span&gt; 121 [1964]: 584-585.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;How would Dr. Blomberg explain that behavior?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In his research on consolation, de Waal found that chimpanzees who observe a fight between two other chimpanzees will offer consolation behavior at much higher rates to the recipient of the aggression than to the aggressor. This also involved hundreds of rigorously quantified conflictive interactions, and not just a few anecdotes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Further research by de Waal shows that chimpanzees do make inferences about the mental and emotional states of other chimpanzees, and then tailor their own behavior accordingly. In other words, we see incipient theories of mind among greater apes. Combined with research about the development of morality in infants, primatology can greatly elucidate what we observe in human beings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Neurobiology is also helping us to make great strides in explaining the origin of human morality. For example, consider recent experiments elucidating the role of Oxytocin, a neuropeptide, in explaining nurturing and “trust” behavior in animals. See, for example,  Duo Jin et al., CD28 is Critical for Social Behaviour by Regulating Oxytocin Secretion. &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt; 446, (1 March 2007): 41-45. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In any case, the conjoining of primatology, neurobiology, and human developmental psychology will probably yield much better explanations for “altruism” than the old “God-does-it” theories, which have not a single piece of verifiable scientific evidence to support them. Dr. Blomberg must interact fully with this scientific and anthropological literature before he can convince us that a theistic argument is a better alternative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If he wishes to respond, I hope Dr. Blomberg can at least address these questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Are you familiar with the the primatological and neurobiological literature I have cited above? If so, could you tell us where you have cited or critiqued it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. How do you explain the motivations of the dog who saved the other dog in traffic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. Why do Rhesus monkeys prefer to starve rather than receive food if that means hurting other monkeys?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. How do you explain that Oxytocin pathway malfunctions will result in a loss of nurturing behavior in some animals?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Otherwise, thanks again for your time and for posting on our website.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In this post I also include a brief thought about John's "Outsider Test" applied to the position of atheism (or any brand of nontheism, if you'd like). &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before I begin addressing Dr. Blomberg's post, I would first like to comment on John's outsider test for faith, which expresses to a believer to test his or her worldview from the point of skepticism (not atheism). As such, John has defined clearly that his proposed method should be attempted by the religious, but since the test presumes agnosticism, it would seem logical for the atheist to satisfy that particular worldview from skepticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three good categories of questions for atheists from the skeptical point of view should be: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) If atheism is true, can the atheist justify this? Can he prove the nonexistence of God? If the atheist claims he is not burdened with such proof, is this properly justified? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) Since God is not the source of morals, where do morals come from, if they in fact exist with any ties to reality whatsoever? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Has the atheist properly analyzed and rejected all definition of God (or gods) offered by the various faiths? What is the atheist's reasons for rejecting these Gods and the faith claims of the major religions? Should the atheist consider the possibility of a God or Gods of a definition that is either not yet known or not yet in wide acceptance? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John and I discussed these questions (and many more) on our trip to the conference of the Evangelical Society last month. Even at the ETS, the two of us spoke and listened to William Lane Craig, Paul Copan, Gary Habermas, and many other well-known Christians, and were challenged by the tough questions they posed. There's no better way to take the "outsider test" for "no faith" than to discuss our position with the greatest scholars outside of our own views and test our positions against theirs. I would invite all skeptics reading this blog to not only continue to challenge the tenants of faith, but also to listen and seriously consider the critiques offered by the best of those outside us who are willing to hold civil discourse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who knows? Some of you may join us in the future in jumping into the "lion's den" of the brightest outside your points of view at welcoming conferences such as the ETS! You may even make a friend or ten, as we did, and nothing can be better than to have a friend with whom you can constantly share important challenges but maintain the kindness that comes with an honest analysis of truth beyond the character and particular beliefs of the person with whom you disagree. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of these important figures outside of our worldview, Dr. Craig Blomberg, offered a testimony in response to John's call for critique. In the spirit of analyzing truth, I will offer my own thoughts to what Dr. Blomberg has written. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find it interesting that Dr. Blomberg regards theistic evolution and Old-Earth Creationism as valid positions. I would, however, wonder what his view of man is - particularly of Adam and Eve - and whether it is consistent with this position. Did God create humans separately, and if so, why all the extra hullabaloo with the slow, painful evolution of the "lower" animals? And if man is God's pinnacle of this mode of creation, in what way did God breathe life into Adam and Eve, who are described in Genesis as beings who are created and life-breathed from the dust as both male and female, separated by Adam's rib, and from whom all humanity has descended? I have never seen a consistent perspective; since I am not interested in creation vs. evolution, I have not read many perspectives (especially Theistic Evolution), so I would be interested in hearing how his view is consistent with his belief in Scripture. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I find it interesting that, as a Lutheran, Dr. Blomberg quotes C.S. Lewis: 'First, there will be three surprises in heaven: who’s there, who’s not there, and there I’m there! Second, there are only two kinds of people in the world—those who say to God, “Thy will be done,” and those to whom God says, “thy will be done.”' For Dr. Lewis' first point, I've always wondered - even while I read him as a Christian - why there should be any surprise at all that one is in Heaven. As a Lutheran, I'm certain Dr. Blomberg would agree that the grace of God is an undeserved gift sent free from consideration of the depravity of the believer, but Lewis does not look at this from a worldly point of view - he looks at it from the point of view of being in Heaven. If one is to hold to the eternal security of the salvation of believers through the effect of God's sovereign will and grace, one should not at all be surprised in a heavenly position. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, Lewis' second point holds some troubling theological concepts. Ultimately, I do realize that it is the Reformed position (such as Luther's) to maintain that the bondage of the will to sin is what damns the sinner, but ultimately, the sovereign choice of God, according to e.g. Romans 9, is what decides the fate of the damned. Ultimately, the pots made for common use destined for wrath that Romans 9 describes do not make themselves; God is the potter, man is the clay, and Paul is explicit and clear about this when he illustrates with the example of Pharaoh: "for this reason I have raised you up." So, ultimately, Christ would say to those on both his left and right hand side: "My will be done." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the Bible's solution to the problem of evil that troubles Dr. Blomberg, and I would wonder how he would respond to this Reformed interpretation that Luther shared. Ultimately, evil action was decreed by God for the purposes of demonstrating His wrath and justice, as the potter/clay analogy demonstrates. Although the Reformers make clear that man is the autonomous source of this evil (so as to save God from directly working it), it is ultimately God's decree of man's bondage to sin through the fall of Adam that causes evil, and man by no power of his own choice - due to his totally depraved nature, of which Dr. Blomberg agrees - can free himself from this predicament. This even blocks the free choice of Christ, made clear by Luther in "Bondage of the Will," and in John 6, in which the throng of 5000 witnessing the miracles of Christ are whittled to twelve somewhat befuddled disciples through Christ's declaration that none may come to Him unless it is first granted by the Father. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evil itself is even created by God, as Isaiah 45:7 declares (and before anyone harps on the "calamity" translation, the Hebrew in question is used elsewhere to describe every sin in the Ten Commandments, and fits the contrast between "peace"- which translates "peace with God" and is contrasted with the sense of "evil" implied, since calamity does not contrast properly in the context of the verse). I would be interested in seeing how this is reconciled with a good God and a God of love as described elsewhere Biblically; even resorting to the necessity of God's desire to demonstrate His justice, as Paul does in Romans, can't work, because it seems quite inconsistent logically with another part of God's identity as described in the Bible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On his question of atheistic evolution and morality, doesn't the point Dr. Blomberg raises commit the (logical) genetic fallacy? Why can't evolution produce moral beings from nonmoral beings, just as it produced beings that lived (even partially) on land versus beings that lived in water? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am interested in the Christian response to what I have written - and even the Skeptic response, since I know that John challenges (even as a fellow nonbeliever) my Reformed view of the Bible versus an Arminian view. I appreciate the civility shown in my earlier posts, and am looking forward to a like lively and respectful discussion following this post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

One thing is certain: it is perhaps the biggest single confidence scam ever perpetrated by one man. You have probably never heard of him before, but as of last Thursday, the world knows him all too well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is &lt;a href="http://www.madoff.com/"&gt;Bernard Madoff&lt;/a&gt;. (This link was active on Sunday, but as of Monday morning it is now just this one-page statement.) And like the vast majority of you, I had never heard of him prior to this past Thursday. That is when reports came out that Mr. Madoff was arrested by US Federal agents for what the &lt;a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-293.htm"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; is describing as “fraud for a multi-billion dollar Ponzi scheme that he perpetrated on advisory clients of his firm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a Ponzi scheme? Thanks to our friends over at &lt;a href="http://www.pyramidschemealert.org/PSAMain/news/PSACallforRegulation.html"&gt;PyramidSchemeAlert.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ponzi schemes, named for 1920s American Charles Ponzi, enrich early investors at the expense of latecomers. Payments to original investors are typically made using money generated by finding new people to buy in to the business. Later investors eventually run out of fresh recruits to the scheme — and with no other source of revenue, the “pyramid” finally collapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what was the total bill for this fraud? It depends on who you talk to, and the dust is still settling, but the reports are that fifty billion dollars ($50,000,000,000.00 US) has been lost at the hands of Madoff. Some estimates say it could go higher, and some think it might be lower. But it is definitely in the billions, and if it is, say, fifty billion dollars or higher, then I can’t think of another way to describe it other than it being the greatest financial con job in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous articles to be found online that are following the story. Here is &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/bernard-madoff.html"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; page - a whole page devoted just to this case. Geographically speaking, this crime hit somewhat close to home for us at The New England Skeptical Society. Several companies based here in Connecticut are in for some very large sums of money with Madoff. One company in particular, Maxam Capital Management in Darien, CT, reportedly lost two hundred eighty million dollars. The company is finished. Several individuals, all Connecticut residents, all ultra-wealthy, and some of notoriety and name recognition, are also some of the victims of this massive fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and get a better grasp of what actually happened in this case, I spoke yesterday with Gene Qualman, financial advisor for Able &amp;amp; Company based in Darien, CT. Gene was able to sum up the case for me better than I could research and report to you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: Is it correct to describe the Madoff case as a Ponzi scheme?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: His wasn’t really a true Ponzi scheme. A true Ponzi scheme is where a crook cons investors out of money by promising returns on a short term basis, but pays the so-called “returns” using other people’s money. For example, if you give me a thousand dollars, I’ll tell you that I will give you back twelve-hundred dollars in a month. Tell that to a bunch of people, so the first ones coming in get paid by using moneys coming in form the next investors. The first investors do get paid, but they are not really making a yield on their investment. They are using the next group of investor’s principal to pay a phony return. By definition, this will eventually fail and collapse. What happens is that as more and more people get in on the deal, thinking they’ve got a good thing going, the base of people that you are obligated to pay grows, you run out of money to pay out, and it collapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: What made Madoff’s scheme different?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: What Madoff did was a little different. He didn’t promise short term big gains. He said that he’ll do the best he can. It was a brilliant scheme. He turned people away, making him a more believable character. What he said was that I’ll invest your money and do my best with it. He did not promise a return. His so-called funds and investments, as time went on year after year, consistently averaged 12% to 16% returns. Even in years when most of the competing funds made little or no money, his still reported high returns. His fund gave consistent, well above average returns. Madoff encouraged certain investors, incredibly well off people, who didn’t immediately need the money, so he was not as vulnerable to people saying “give me all of my money back.” This gave him a wider base to pull from. By comparison, in a classic Ponzi scheme, people are looking to get their investment back in a much shorter period of time. His technique is more accurately called “Robbing Peter to pay Paul.” It is a modified Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What got him caught is that the current problems with the economy have been so devastating that he had to ultimately confess. My understanding is that many hedge funds are getting calls for redemptions – meaning investors looking to make very large or complete withdrawals form the funds. Madoff got calls for seven billion dollars in redemptions, and he had almost nothing left to give them. I’m not sure it will end up being fifty billion dollars because I think that number is an estimate which includes all the estimated accumulated rates of return he made over a period of time. Supposedly, an investor’s account earned money and then they would reinvest those profits, accumulating year after year. Some people would get checks or payouts once a year and very few people asked for all their money back. He had enough to get by, but lately, the demand for redemptions have been so huge that it caught up to him at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: How was Madoff able to pull it off for so long without getting caught or having it collapse sooner than it did?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: What Madoff did was to insist that when people give him the money, they give him what is known as “custody” of the funds. He was also allowed to do “internal reporting”, and he insisted on “clearing his own trades.” These are all dangerous signs. If you are going to give your money to anyone who insists on these three conditions, don’t do it. “Clearing his own trades” means that there is no outside way to double check him. “Custody” means he can co-mingle funds. I always tell my clients to make sure they make them their own account. You get a monthly statement held by an outside authority, so you can see what is really going on. But when you get into these issues of what Madoff was doing, such as co-mingling money, you are ripe for the picking. Money comes in, you have no clue what happens to it. He’ll give you a report, but where is the authority to double check it to make sure it is correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: Who was supposed to be watching and checking on Madoff?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: The other thing that is going to be interesting to follow is that the firm he used to audit his work, that was supposed to be a last-gap clearance to check his work, was not there. He supposedly had this outside auditor that supposedly gave a statement each year saying things were ok. But obviously, things were not ok. So the question is why did he get the clearance? I believe there will be other people implicated in this. Based on the scale and magnitude of this, it is almost impossible that one person could have done all this alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of smart people in the industry that did not get involved in this person. Now that they are being polled, they did not think he was doing some kind of Ponzi scheme, but rather they thought he was doing something called “front running.” Front running is an illegal technique as well, but it happens. If you are doing trades for people, and suddenly, one day at 9am, you get many of your clients saying “sell XYZ company”, you know then that lots of orders are about to come in for sales. So what you would do is to short sell XYZ Company, and THEN place their orders, and it brings the price down even lower. That’s front running, and it is totally illegal. Ironically, the folks that did not want to get involved with him thought this was how he was making his yields. In reality, he was not making a yield of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony here is that he managed to get away with it for so long, at the magnitude he did, against the pool of incredibly intelligent, wealthy, and established investors who trusted him. There did not seem to be any checks and balances along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: How much did his personality have to do with his success?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: His personality, and his reputation, had quite a lot to do with his scam. He used to run NASDAQ, so he has a reputation of trustworthiness. The way he did it was very smart. He did not pressure people. Many well known people were pushing for him (vouching for him) and he turned several people away for a variety of reasons, not the least of which to help create an air of legitimacy. When they asked him how he was consistently able to make this well above average rate of return, he made up a term that people didn’t understand. They assumed it was just his own secret formula. No one questioned him any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: We’re not far from the epicenter of Madoff’s crimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: The loss in pension funds for those based in Fairfield County (CT) is out about forty two million dollars. Reportedly, there is a hedge fund here in Darien, CT that lost two hundred eighty million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: What needs to happen to better protect people from these con artists?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: Madoff either wasn’t policed enough, or he had such a clever way of recording his dealings that it got by the authorities. The SEC and other local agencies similar to them, such as the Connecticut Banking Commission, are just too short handed. Their case load is huge. They typically have only three days to do three weeks work of work. It is no that they are lax or careless. They just don’t have the manpower. These agencies need much more funding for auditing. This is a real good way to protect people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evan: Now that this one has become exposed, what can we expect in the future?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene: If authorities had the time to look at certain hedge funds, they will find out that variations on these scams have occurred. Probably not as skilled or involved as this one, but this could be the next leg of the financial industry that gets rocked to the core. &lt;em&gt;(end interview)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures, and then some, are echoed more abruptly and loudly by Robert Fitzpatrick at Pyramid Scheme Alert. Robert has made it his life long mission to do everything he can to alert everyone to the dangers of the Bernard Madoff’s of the world. The bottom line is that schemes can effect anyone, of any intelligence, any social status, from all walks of life. By using some of the tools in our skeptical toolkit, we might be able to better protect ourselves, our families, and our businesses when making big economic decisions – especially nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Evan Bernstein</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229351201207"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4737">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a55f621f7c61648b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies, 12.15</title><published>2008-12-15T14:00:31Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T14:00:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4737" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Robert Niemtzow. In the post, I started with an admittedly exaggerated vignette--a story, if you will--of a soldier whose leg was shredded by a mortar in battle. When the medic came to treat his wounds and get him ready for transport, this soldier was in for a surprise, because after applying a tourniquet to his leg, this medic offered him not morphine for his pain but acupuncture. At the time, the military acupuncture program spearheaded by Col. Niemtzow was not proposing anything like the incident I fictionalized. Indeed, I was intentionally exaggerating to make a point. It was nothing more than creative license. (I know, I know, calling anything "creative" on this blog is a bit of a stretch, but stay with me for the moment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I'm not so sure if what I was writing was creative license or uncanny prediction. In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if maybe I should take James' Randi's $1,000,000 challenge before he folds it, because my prediction is starting to sound almost prescient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/woo_in_the_military_acupuncture.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/woo_in_the_military_acupuncture.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/485543654" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229348648757"><id gr:original-id="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/?p=1013">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e2ae9e93fcd6ab17</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">World?s oldest computer resurrected after 2,000 years</title><published>2008-12-15T10:37:41Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T10:37:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.sciencepunk.com/v5/2008/12/worlds-oldest-computer-resurrected-after-2000-years/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">It has no hard drive, no peripherals, and won’t run Windows Vista.  But that doesn’t mean that the Antikythera Mechanism is anything less than incredible.  The 2,000-year-old computer was discovered on an Ancient Greek shipwreck 100 years ago, and thanks to miracles of modern science (including X-ray and gamma radiographs used to probe its hidden [...]</summary><author><name>Frank the SciencePunk</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229348648756"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1723">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c0ece336d0af7480</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Parental age is a ‘risk factor’ for autism</title><published>2008-12-15T09:50:51Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T09:50:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/485403365/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Kev</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229346498935"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/there_are_still_people_like_th.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f05a68cd4504880</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evil"/><title type="html">There are still people like this roaming about</title><published>2008-12-15T12:45:45Z</published><updated>2008-12-15T12:45:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/485517757/there_are_still_people_like_th.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/there_are_still_people_like_th.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;America is kind of a land of thugs, isn't it?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Alternative Medicine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the biggest victory scored by the promoters of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) was the name itself. Fifty years ago what passes today as CAM was snake oil, fraud, folk medicine, and quackery. The promoters of dubious health claims were charlatans, quacks, and con artists. Somehow they managed to pull off the greatest con of all - a culture change in which fraud became a legitimate alternative to scientific medicine, the line between science and pseudoscience was deliberate blurred, regulations designed to protect the public from quackery were weakened or eliminated, and it became politically incorrect to defend scientific standards in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of CAM proponents is nothing less than the elimination of the standard of care in medicine in exchange for an anything goes approach. Key to their strategy was the language game - getting people to talk about fraud and pseudoscience in medicine as if it were a legitimate “alternative”, that pseudoscience can “complement” science or be “integrated” with it. Scientific medicine was rebranded with derogatory labels such as “Western” and “allopathic.” Anyone defending the scientific standard of medicine was attacked as closed-minded, and accused of protectionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very fact that there is a category of medicine such as CAM, whatever you call it, is a significant defeat for scientific medicine. CAM as a category includes an extremely diverse collection of claims and modalities that do not share a common theme or philosophy, including some that are mutually exclusive. The only thing they have in common is that they do not meet the scientific standards of mainstream medicine. The only purpose of the CAM category is to create a space in which substandard or unscientific modalities can exist. It exists to create a double standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Perfect Storm of Anti-Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace Sampson, writing for &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=150"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, gives an excellent overview of the last forty years of medicine and what went wrong. He points to several cultural trends that conspired together to allow the anti-scientific revolution to occur. These include political correctness - which has had the effect of rendering appropriate scientific criticism as impolite. The post-modernist influence in academia also played a major role, one aspect of which is the portrayal of science as just another narrative without any special relationship to the truth. In fact science, according to some post-modernists, is just a way for one group (in this case Western white males) to impose their power over minorities and the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add to this a general anti-establishment movement beginning in the 1960s. CAM proponents were successful in portraying scientific medicine as the Establishment - something that needed to be taken down. This evolved into the “health care freedom” movement, the ostensible purpose of which was to earn freedom for the public to access whatever health care they wanted. In reality the health care freedom movement is about earning freedom for practitioners to do whatever they want, free from any regulation meant to protect the public. I find it one of the greatest ironies of the CAM phenomenon that they have been able to pass laws that are overtly anti-consumer, in that they remove protection from fraud or incompetence, in the name of consumer freedom. Why hasn’t Ralph Nader noticed this? What if the auto industry promoted “automobile freedom” laws so that consumers could buy any vehicles they wanted, free from any government quality or safety regulation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up the political dimension of CAM. Proponents have been successful at working both sides of the aisle, appealing to anti-regulation sentiment on the right and anti-corporate/anti-establishment sentiment on the left. Unfortunately, science has no political party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course all of this is happening in a generally scientifically illiterate society.  In my experience most of the public does not understand why homeopathy cannot possibly work (it’s just water), why scientists are confident that there is no mysterious life force at work in the body, why chiropractic subluxations make no sense, and why megadosing vitamins or the latest fad tropical fruit juice cannot cure everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, of course, there are legitimate criticisms of mainstream medicine. The system is under great financial strain. Technology, while extremely effective, is very expensive and may render some medical encounters very unpleasant and frightening.  The ethical model in medicine has also shifted from a paternalistic model, where doctors just did what they thought was best, to a cooperative model that focuses on informed consent.  This is a good thing, but it means that physicians are ethically obliged to tell patients the whole and unpleasant truth. We do not have the luxury of lying to patients to make them feel better. Charlatans have no such constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Defeats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific tactical defeats of scientific medicine include, first and foremost, the cultural non-judgmental acceptance of an “alternative” category of medicine. But in addition to this, there is the NCCAM (National Center for CAM), which was created specifically to fund CAM research. These funds, however, are generally spent doing studies designed to promote CAM, not answer the only question that really matters - does it safely work. More than a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars later, there has not been a single CAM modality that has been proven by research to the point that is has gained general acceptance, nor has any modality been rejected as disproven. Sorting what works from what does not work is the primary purpose of medical research, so in that regard the NCCAM is an unmitigated failure. But, it has lent incredible legitimacy to CAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care freedom laws have been passed in almost 20 states - eliminating the ability of states to act against practitioners simply because what they are doing is substandard (as long as they self-label what they do “alternative”). That’s right - eliminating the standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 removed “supplements” from the control of the FDA, and redefined supplements to include herbs used as drugs, and pretty much anything else that is not already a drug. It also created a separate category of health claims, so-called structure function claims, that are beyond regulation. This led to an explosion of the supplement industry.  This allows snake oil peddlers to decry the excesses of the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry, while making billions in the largely unregulated supplement industry. To further increase the irony, in many cases the two industries are one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reasonable person might think that medical academia would be the last line of defense for scientific medicine. Surely trained medical scientists can see anti-scientific propaganda for what it is and will defend the scientific integrity of their profession. Unfortunately, this is largely not the case. Academics have been cowed by calls for “freedom” and political correctness. Promoters have learned to speak the language of academics to further subdue their skepticism - using pleasant terms like “holistic”, and “patient-centered” practice. Like most deceptions, there is always a kernel of truth to such ideas. But in the end it all amounts to a sweet-sounding justification for outright pseudoscientific quackery in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens, however, because the academics who should know better are largely asleep at the switch. They have mostly put CAM into the hands of proponents, because they are the ones who are interested. Most physicians and scientists are “shruggies” when it comes to CAM - they just don’t think about it and don’t want to think about it. So proponents have been able to become the gatekeepers of their own claims. CAM proponents are appointed to committees on CAM, are able to make CAM curricula for students, and decide what CAM journals should be registered with the International Library of Medicine (which means they can keep out critics). The foxes are in charge of the hen house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this also means is that those few of us who are trying to point out that the Emperor has no clothes (to use a tired metaphor), and defend science-based medicine are made to seem like ideological, closed-minded fanatics.  Defending science in medicine is no longer politically correct - at least not within the alternate reality of CAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More irony. Over the last couple of decades there has been a growing movement within mainstream medicine called evidence-based medicine (EBM). One might think that EBM would have worked to retard the advance of CAM but the opposite was true. It is an unfortunate happenstance of history that the minds behind EBM inadvertently played into the hands of CAM proponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept behind EBM is that  medical modalities should be judged primarily by the empirical evidence, not by their plausibility. The reason for this was the perception that too many practices were being widely used because they made sense - they were plausible - despite a lack of evidence that they actually worked. Therefore EBM was constructed to eliminate the advantage of plausibility. Medical claims require evidence no matter how plausible they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by eliminating plausibility (or prior probability) from consideration EBM also leveled the field for highly implausible claims, even though this was never the intent. EBM is not unreasonable in a world where it is assumed that treatments and claims make basic scientific sense, but it is not equipped to deal with a world in which highly implausible claims are being promoted. This had the effect of almost eliminating basic science from consideration. Under EBM claims that are highly implausible are treated the same as claims that are highly plausible. This approach exists no where else in science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, CAM proponents just adopted the language of EBM. It did not take long for CAM modalities to have the EBM label slapped on them, whether or not they earned it even by the flawed methods of EBM. I see “evidence-based homeopathy” or “evidence-based acupuncture” promoted all the time, even though these terms are oxymorons.  Even without consideration of prior plausibility CAM modalities do not fair well under EBM examination, so proponents simply lie. They claim their methods are EBM even when no formal EBM evaluation has validated them. They behave as if their personal assessment of the evidence is sufficient to support a claim of EBM, when in fact there are formal methods of systematic review that are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the EBM infrastructure is vulnerable. They already fail to put CAM modalities in their proper scientific perspective by considering prior probability. And now they too are putting the foxes in charge of the hen house - allowing CAM proponents to perform and publish biased EBM reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Ray of Hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote about the &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=437"&gt;National Health Statistics&lt;/a&gt;  on use of CAM by Americans. The stats have been misrepresented by proponents to argue that CAM is increasingly popular, followed by the argument ad populi that therefore they should be supported. A closer look at the data, however, shows that the hard-core CAM modalities are still marginal, and not significantly increasing. In the last year only 1.4% of Americans used acupuncture, 1.7% homeopathy, and 0.5% energy healing (by self report). These numbers are not significantly different than 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of these modalities remains marginal. I am not sure exactly how to interpret this. The best-case interpretation is that most of the public still regards the magical claims of homeopathy and acupuncture with skepticism. The most pessimistic interpretation is that the public accepts these modalities in greater numbers, but the infrastructure has not yet expanded to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also find some comfort in the fact that most of my colleagues have not drunk the Koolaid of CAM. They regard it as quackery - and yet frustratingly think it’s not their responsibility to do anything about it.  But perhaps there is a growing backlash against the nonsense. I think as CAM’s profile increases, the sham at its core is more apparent. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is grim. A generation of health care providers is being indoctrinated into unscientific acceptance of dubious claims and methods. The public has largely bought the framework of CAM. Even among skeptics I find that CAM is a frequent blind spot. The propaganda has simply been extremely effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most disheartening is that academia has largely failed to recognize and confront this attack on science. They now understand well the threat of creationism/intelligent design. They get it. They do not understand how CAM erodes the scientific basis of medicine and the standard of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of us who are opposing the infiltration of pseudoscience into medicine have an uphill battle, and no apparent allies. We have been marginalized. We are also a couple of steps behind the CAM proponents in understanding how the language and the laws are being manipulated. We’re catching on, but we are already far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is not hopeless, but it is desperate. I think in the long run science always has the advantage that it actually works. But history has shown us that cultural inertia can be immense. As CAM becomes infused in the culture and in the institutions of health care it is becoming entrenched and will be difficult to remove. It will likely continue to be a drain 0n the effectiveness and efficiency of health care for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#CC0000"&gt; &amp;quot;Fire those fuckers,&amp;quot; he said of those who wrote critical editorials about him at the Chicago Tribune, and threatened to hurt the paper financially if it did not oblige. &amp;quot;If they don&amp;#39;t perform, fuck &amp;#39;em&amp;quot;, he said of an effort to squeeze contributions from a state contractor.  But the most stunning charge is that Mr Blagojevich, who can appoint a nominee to hold Mr Obama&amp;#39;s seat in the Senate until the scheduled election is held in 2010, wanted to sell the seat to the highest bidder. (The governor called the seat &amp;quot;a fucking valuable thing, you don&amp;#39;t just give it away for nothing&amp;quot; and is alleged to have sought to get a big job in return for it.) . . . The complaint also alleges that Mr Blagojevich knew whom Mr Obama wanted to see in the seat, apparently his close adviser, Valerie Jarrett, and was less than happy (&amp;quot;fuck them&amp;quot;) that all he would get in return for giving her the seat would be &amp;quot;appreciation&amp;quot;. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Americans don't think well of people who talk like this when they have important roles in public life.  That means that a small additional offense by such individuals may go unnoticed: their hypocrisy in being elected on fair words and clean talk and then relaxing into a very different foul-mouthed persona once in the job.  By censoring even mentions of the taboo vocabulary of such hypocrites, the mainstream press helps to protect them.  Less of the evidence of what they're like gets out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I agree that trying to sell a Senate seat is much worse than swearing on the phone. But somehow you don't get the measure of Rod Blagofuckinjevich's coarseness and contempt for the public by merely learning that he regarded his gubernatorial privilege as valuable; "a fuckin' valuable thing" gets across more of the flavor of the man.  And his "fuck them" about the advisory team of our recently elected president is revealing too.  So that's what he thinks of their preferences, and ultimately ours too.  It's not just that we're supposed to put up with having whichever Senator pays him the most; it's pretty clear that if we told him who we thought should be named to the seat, he would later talk about us behind our back to his trusted confidants, and what he'd be saying into his cell phone about us would be "fuck them".  The linguistic extra shoe flung at us should not be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

No disrespectful skeptical response to such a respected scholar will be published.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I Am Still a Christian&lt;/strong&gt;, by Dr. Craig Blomberg:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I was raised in what I later learned to identify as a very liberal parish of the old Lutheran Church in America.  I was confirmed in 1968, the year American society seemed to be falling apart.  I took it as seriously as anyone in my confirmation class, which isn’t saying all that much.  We spent more time discussing Simon and Garfunkel lyrics and Jesus Christ Superstar than we did Luther’s Catechism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In my public high school my best friend brought me to our Campus Life club.  There for the first time I met kids my own age who spoke about having a personal relationship with Jesus and it was clearly making a difference in their lives.  In a culture in which “eggheads” like me who were neither athletic nor very good looking, and as a result had very few friends, they genuinely befriended me (and many others).  I wanted what they had and prayed one February night in 1970 to receive Jesus as my Savior and to make him my Lord.  But it wasn’t so much a revolutionary new idea as my sense that this was what the Lutherans had once been about but had given it up, at least in my church, for newer, trendier things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I was valedictorian of my high school class of 750.  I set out to be a mathematician.  (I did teach high school math for one year.)  In college, I encountered religious studies taught from a perspective that publicly acknowledged it was trying to destroy historic Christian faith.  A delightful church history professor (and an ordained Lutheran) once told us with a big grin but very seriously that it was impossible to be an evangelical Christian and maintain one’s intellectual integrity.  I was enough of an intellectual I determined to see if I thought he was right.  Fortunately we had a good library and a couple good local bookstores where I found resources in abundance, not in any religion professor’s bibliographies, that convinced me he was wrong.  A disproportionate number of those books in the mid-1970s were written by British scholars or by Americans who taught at a school near Chicago called Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, so I decided to go to seminary at TEDS and, later, to doctoral study in Aberdeen, Scotland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Most seminarians complain of periodic spiritual dry times.  I didn’t have that experience.  I had spent the previous eight years trying tactfully to share my faith with any who would listen.  I’m not sure there were any of the major challenges to Christianity that I didn’t encounter in those volatile years.  I had found what I thought were some good answers to some of the questions, but seminary enabled me to find a whole lot more and, of course, to discover how much I didn’t know in other areas of theology.  So I proceeded to doctoral study.  I felt called to teach New Testament studies and have done so ever since, first at the undergraduate and then at the graduate level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Why am I still a Christian all these years later?  First, I have to stress what I don’t mean by the word “Christian”.  I don’t mean someone who has to be politically conservative.  On many issues, I am not; I voted for Obama.  I don’t mean someone who has to be a creationist; I believe in an old earth and theistic evolution.  (One of my daughters, when she was too young to know her hilarious double-entendre, once summed up my views as succinctly as anything I’ve ever heard:  if there was a big bang, there had to be a big banger!)  By Christian I don’t mean someone who knows God’s will for those who haven’t been given a credible chance to respond to the gospel.  As I’ve studied Christian history, I’ve learned there are about six major approaches to the question.  I have some hunches, but I ultimately retreat to my convictions about God’s justice and grace.  I can trust him to work it out.  As for judgment more generally, I like two excerpts from C. S. Lewis in particular.  First, there will be three surprises in heaven:  who’s there, who’s not there, and there I’m there!  Second, there are only two kinds of people in the world—those who say to God, “Thy will be done,” and those to whom God says, “thy will be done.”  Finally, by a Christian, I don’t mean someone who pretends to have the problem of suffering and evil solved.  But again, an easy-to-remember tripartite answer goes a long way for me.  Why doesn’t God do something (or do more than he has)?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) He has done something.  He sent Jesus to die for human sin, which is a major contributing factor to suffering and evil, and to begin a process of transformation in them for the better.  (2) He is doing something, not least in the ways throughout church history in which Christians have helped make the world a substantially better place.  (If all you’ve ever studied are the ways people have done bad things in the name of Jesus, check out a book like New Zealander and Oxfordian Nathan Hill’s What Has Christianity Ever Done for Us: How It Shaped the Modern World [2005] and discover the disproportionately large role it has played over the centuries in the disciplines of literature and law, medicine and science, art and education.  Note, too, who comes forward to help the most in response to contemporary disasters and who most keeps long term relief and development programs afloat.)  (3) He will do much, much more, eventually righting all the wrongs of the world.  But the only way that can happen will be for him to intervene so as to abolish human freedom to rebel against him, which will mean the end of the world as we know it and the end of any opportunity for people to freely choose for him as well.  He delays the end because of his mercy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As you can tell, I’ve already begun to answer my own question.  The short summary answer to why I am still a Christian is because I haven’t found any other world view, ideology, religion, or –ism that makes nearly as much sense of all of the pieces of the world as I have studied and experienced it.  After tragedies like 9/11 or, locally, Columbine, I marvel at those people who can say all humans are basically good.  It was G. K. Chesterton who once wrote that the depravity of humanity is the most empirically verifiable doctrine of the Christian faith!  But I also marvel at those who can say that atheistic evolution can account for all of human behavior.  What about the sheer altruism, utterly unmotivated by self-interest, which leads firefighters to sacrifice their lives by running back into towering infernos?  Only the concept of humans made in the image of God can account for that in my estimation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In fact, if Christians have to wrestle with the problem of evil, so must everyone else.  Indeed, we must all wrestle as well with the problem of good.  Where do these concepts come from?  What makes the most hardened atheist (usually) insist that there is something just plain wrong, perhaps even immoral, with torturing prisoners, abusing children, raping women, and with someone else gratuitously murdering them.  The most advanced of apes has never disclosed any awareness of systems of morality, which is why we never arrest and imprison them, even if they kill humans.  (We might euthanize them once in awhile, but not as retributive punishment, merely to protect the rest of humanity.)  And we certainly don’t condemn multiple-partner animals of being unfaithful to their mates.  Mark Twain (no evangelical he!) put it well:  “Man is the only animal that blushes, or needs to.”  Near the end of his life, Darwin admitted he had no satisfying explanation for human moral consciousness and reasoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Most (not all) atheists I meet are not interested in talking about religion or ideologies that function like religion.  No matter how tactful I try to be, they respond to my questions either by changing the subject or by ridiculing or getting angry with me.  I do not see them having an overarching purpose that gives their life meaning and fills them with deep joy and confidence in the future despite all the trauma of the present.  I do see this, though, in countless theists, especially Christians (which is not to deny that we still sin, sometimes in big ways, and that there are even a few perennial “jerks” in our midst!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Watching people die is an experience everyone should have at not too old an age in life, but many today don’t because we have hidden death by institutionalizing it.  I’ve watched a number of people dying in my 53 years of life and it’s then when you find out someone’s true colors.  If there is no afterlife and this life is all there is, I still can’t think of any better way to die than with the peace and quiet confidence I’ve observed in and discussed with several Christians who’ve told me they can’t explain it, it wasn’t anything they conjured up in their own strength, it was simply given to them for their last days.  If there is an afterlife and the possibility of being part of the new heavens and earth as Revelation 21-22 describes, however metaphorically, why would anyone not want to be a part of it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; That, in a nutshell is why I am still a Christian.  Thanks for reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

When you’re on the &lt;strong&gt;Atkins ‘Diet’&lt;/strong&gt;, of course! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="tenets-of-the-atkins-diet" src="http://skepbitch.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/tenets-of-the-atkins-diet.jpg?w=118&amp;amp;h=96" alt="tenets-of-the-atkins-diet" width="118" height="96"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.skepticreport.com/medicalquackery/atkins.htm"&gt;Atkins Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; advocates a diet high in protein…not tofu and lentils, we’re talkin’ lard, baby! You must cast aside carbohydrates; the demons of cereals, potatoes, pasta, rice, and most of all…bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But feel free to gorge on bacon, burgers and butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…And all the supplement vitamins your liver can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Robert Atkins&lt;/strong&gt; knew how to turn a diet into a fucking cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘Nutritionist’ diet guru was a bit of a fatty too. Moreover, his &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/11/1076388432133.html"&gt;medical records&lt;/a&gt; revealed that he’d suffered from heart disease and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone named &lt;strong&gt;Burke&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.ediets.com/news/NewsArticle.jsp?id=4300034"&gt;ediets.com&lt;/a&gt; claims, “One of the benefits of the Atkins plan is that it gets you away from eating too much sugar and processed foods.” Burke neglects to mention that it gets you onto eating too much saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aniboom.com/video/291768/Bang-Bang-You-are-Bread/"&gt;Bang, Bang, You’re Bread!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an animated short movie by my friend, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;Mitch Wade&lt;/strong&gt;. The film is about a loaf of bread that desperately wants to be consumed, but is shunned by consumers because of the Atkins Diet fad. The bread then seeks its revenge on Dr Atkins. The movie is skeptical, and surprisingly sexy. I never thought I’d be turned on by a cannibalistic rash of bacon, a sultry, smoking lolly pop, and a loaf of bread begging to be eaten…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And what of the &lt;strong&gt;Atkins Diet&lt;/strong&gt;? It’s all about intake restriction. A diet that advised the sole intake of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.arnotts.com.au/products/TimTam.aspx"&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tam"&gt;Tams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; would be as effective (for ahwile), and much more enjoyable…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/news/expertline/details.php?contact_id=460"&gt;Professor Mark Wahlqvist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sums up the facts rather neatly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key to understanding the Atkins Diet is that it’s about weight loss and not necessarily fat loss – at least in the short term, because the Atkins Diet maximises the loss of body water, especially from liver, which is a large organ in the body, and also from muscle, which is a very large organ in the body. What we know is if you don’t have a regular wide variety of plant foods in your diet, relatively intact, or if you like, whole, that is to say, wholegrains and seeds and nuts and fruits and vegetables, then you will increase your risk of the major burden of disease of Western society – cancers, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and probably even mental illness, the more we know about nutrition and the brain. The Atkins Diet is not a diet geared to long-term health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/dimensions/dimensions_health/Transcripts/s853516.htm"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is definitely worth perusing over breakfast…perhaps over a nice slice of raisin toast…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Auckland, New Zealand recently a warehouse was set ablaze. It was quite the inferno, needing a huge effort to quell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knows what started it… &lt;a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;amp;objectid=10547987"&gt;but rumors are spreading&lt;/a&gt; that it was a meteorite that did the damage. Several people saw a fireball in the sky, and it happened around 10:00, around the time the fire started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case closed, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/meteor_aucklandfire.jpg" alt="Photoshop of a meteor over Auckland fire"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bzzzzt. Nope. I will almost guarantee a meteorite did not start this fire! Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteors are chunks of rock or debris that enter the Earth’s atmosphere. They violently compress the air, heating it up — it’s not friction that does the heating, contrary to common belief. But common wisdom also says that meteorites would hit the ground still burning hot, and cause fires wherever they land. And after all, we’ve seen it in countless movies! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a piece of info you should remember here: &lt;em&gt;that’s in the movies&lt;/em&gt;. In real life, meteorites don’t work that way. A small meteoroid (the solid part of the glowing meteor) will burn up rapidly, leaving nothing to hit the ground. If it’s somewhat bigger, like the size of a car, it’ll explode high in the atmosphere, and then pieces of it will rain down. However, those smaller pieces fall relatively slowly, and have plenty of time to cool down before they hit. &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/28/breaking-canadian-fireball-fragments-found/"&gt;The recent fireball over Canada shows that&lt;/a&gt;, as did &lt;a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050724.html"&gt;a rain of meteorites that hit Chicago a few years ago did too&lt;/a&gt;. No fires were caused by those rains of rocks from space, because they were cold when they hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A piece of rock or metal large enough to retain its heat when it impacts the ground would be pretty big, like over 100 meters across. Those tend to be a bit more obvious when they impact, since they explode with a yield equal to that of a 15 megaton blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might do a bit more damage than start a warehouse fire. Had something like that been the cause of the Auckland warehouse fire, there wouldn’t be anyone left in the city to report it. There would be &lt;em&gt;a smoking hole a mile across.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard reports like this one many times. They always — always — &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/news/salisburymeteor.html"&gt;turn out to be&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/tv/skyfire.html"&gt;non-extraterrestrial in origin&lt;/a&gt;. Just because a bright meteor was seen does not mean it caused the fire! That’s a logical fallacy: &lt;em&gt;post hoc ergo propter hoc&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;after this therefore because of this.&amp;quot; There’s a reason that’s called a fallacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s why I think a meteorite didn’t cause this fire, and I’m pretty sure there’s a more down-to-Earth explanation here… at least one that started off down-to-Earth and didn’t just end up that way. &lt;/p&gt;

The subject concerns the polar ozone hole in Antarctica and a possible role for cosmic rays in its variability on solar cycle timescales. The proponents of this link are a small research group at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada, who find themselves up against the mainstream stratospheric chemistry community and whose ideas are twisted out of all recognition by the more foolish of the usual suspects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story hit the 'tubes earlier this year when researcher Q.B. Lu &lt;a href="http://newsrelease.uwaterloo.ca/news.php?id=4997"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that this years Antarctic ozone hole would be the biggest ever due to the actions of increased galactic cosmic rays (GCR) (because we are at solar minimum and GCR are inversely correlated to solar activity). This years peak ozone hole has now come and gone, and the prediction can therefore be evaluated. Unfortunately for Dr. Lu, this year's hole was merely about &lt;a href="http://www.theozonehole.com/ozonehole2008.htm"&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; for the decade - a result that wasn't too supportive for his theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story made me a little curious about this though. Firstly, I didn't initially understand why cosmic rays should be playing a role in ozone depletion - most of the cosmic ray effects that are usually discussed revolve around cloud-aerosol connections, but there are not many clouds in the stratosphere where the ozone holes form, and the ones there are (Polar Stratospheric Clouds - PSCs) are much more sensitive to temperature and water vapour than they are likely to be to background aerosols. On further investigation, it turns out that this idea has been out there for a few years (and was &lt;a href="http://focus.aps.org/story/v8/st8"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on then) and has subsequently been discussed in the ozone literature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's start with the background theory. Standard (Nobel-prize winning) stratospheric chemistry has tied ozone depletion to the increasing chlorine (Cl) load in the stratosphere which catalytically destroys ozone and comes from the photolytic dissolution of human-sourced chloro-fluoro-carbons (CFCs) high in the stratosphere. In the polar night, the presence of PSCs allows for a specific class of heterogeneous Cl reactions to occur on the surface of the cloud particles which turn out to be very efficient at destroying ozone. Hence the presence of an ozone hole in the very cold Antarctic polar vortex. Since PSCs are very sensitive to temperature, cold winter vortex conditions often presage a large ozone depletion the following spring (note that polar ozone depletion only occurs in sunlight and so is a spring time phenomena in both hemispheres). This is pretty much undisputed at this point (well, at least by serious scientists). We here at RealClimate even used this relationship to &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/03/will-spring-2005-be-a-bad-one-for-arctic-ozone/"&gt;predict&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/05/2005-arctic-ozone-loss/"&gt;successfully&lt;/a&gt;) a particularly large Arctic ozone depletion event in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lu's theory though &lt;a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v87/i7/e078501"&gt;posits&lt;/a&gt; an additional mechanism to release the Cl from the CFCs - and that is through GCR effects. Specifically, Lu suggests that the action of the GCR on CFCs attached to PSCs causes more Cl to be released, thus potentially delivering more Cl exactly where it could enhance polar depletion most effectively. The evidence for this comes from correlations of ozone loss with GCR (over a couple of solar cycles) and some suggestive lab experiments. Note that this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; call into question the anthropogenic source of the Cl which is still from CFCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://scitation.aip.org/journals/doc/JCPSA6-ft/vol_129/iss_2/027101_1-F1.jpg" align="right" width="50%"&gt;However, Lu and colleagues' theory has been strongly challenged in the literature. For instance, &lt;a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v89/i21/e219803"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v89/i21/e219801"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v91/i5/e058502"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The comments focus on two main aspects, the weakness of the correlations (see figure), and the ancillary evidence that there isn't any obvious evidence for CFC destruction in the polar vortex itself. In fact, correlations of CFCs with air mass tracers from the upper stratosphere are very stable, indicating that the photolytic conversion of the CFCs is by far the dominant source of Cl. These rebuttals seem quite compelling, and there doesn't seem to be much continued support for Dr. Lu's GCR idea. However, Lu is still pushing it (hence the press release this year just weeks before the prediction would be put to the test). One might think Dr. Lu's ideas wrong, but one can't fault his bravery in putting them to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we stated above, the un-exceptional ozone loss this year pretty much undermines the correlations that were at the heart of Lu's idea. Thus I predict that this is unlikely to be discussed very much more in the literature except as an example of how interesting ideas are generated, discussed, tested and (in this case) found wanting. This indeed is how scientific progress is made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as has often been noted, the contrarian-sphere is a world on its own. It was inevitable that the headline link between GCR and ozone holes would entice the old-school ozone depletion skeptics and 'everything-is-solar" proponents out of their burrows.  Tim Ball led the &lt;a href="http://www.friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/FoS_Ozone&amp;amp;CarbonDioxide.pdf"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt;. Now Dr. Ball is a long time skeptic on the human influence on ozone depletion as well as climate change, and so he couldn't resist the occasion to opine on all theories anthropogenic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nurtured by environmental hysteria and the determination to show all changes in the natural world are due to human activity, the claim CFCs were destroying ozone jumped directly from an unproven hypothesis to a scientific fact.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also includes standard statements implying that scientists implicated CFCs in ozone depletion to deprive the developing world of refrigeration (oh my!), how there hasn't been a change in ozone depletion in any case (despite showing a series of figures obviously demonstrating this - see &lt;a href="http://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/monthly/climatology_10.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well) and so on….  He did however note that Dr. Lu&amp;#39;s theories don&amp;#39;t actually change any of the mainstream prescriptions for dealing with ozone depletion (though he does get confused about the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impact on stratospheric temperatures - it makes them colder, not warmer). But the real prize goes to Dennis &lt;a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/11/avery-and-singer-unstoppable-hot-air/"&gt;"unstoppable"&lt;/a&gt; Avery who &lt;a href="http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/5296"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that Dr. Lu's theories will confirm a link of GCR to climate change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If the South Pole gets an ozone-hole maximum in the coming weeks, it will strengthen the case for cosmic rays, and endorse a Modern Warming driven by solar variations rather than human-emitted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same logic as assuming that because salt makes food taste better, throwing it behind your shoulder must bring luck. That is, they are just not connected. And I'm pretty sure he won't accept the logical corollary. Needless to say this is a very feeble grasping at straws. But to quote a recent &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/dec/09/climate-change-science-environment"&gt;Monbiot article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is no pool so shallow that a thousand bloggers won't drown in it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor an ozone hole it seems either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it's that time of year again.  Last year, I gave you weekly flu updates from the CDC and from my position on the front line.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, it's still quiet.  I haven't personally seen any cases yet, but I'm sure to soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not too late to get vaccinated.  Wash your hands frequently.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember what the flu is and is not.  Influenza is characterized by the sudden onset of high fevers (usually greater than 102), muscle pain, and sometimes runny nose and cough.  If you can get to your doctor within the first 48 hours, there are medications that may help you get better a little bit faster.  Best, though is prevention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/its_back_get_ready_for_the_flu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/484970814" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229294272268"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/rightful_actions.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5f433d6b319b4bfd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Rightful actions</title><published>2008-12-14T22:10:36Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T22:10:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/484942896/rightful_actions.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/rightful_actions.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our president, the wretched villain who threw away our economy and our people's lives in a wasteful, failed war, skulked into Iraq and tried to pretend he was a hero. Nobody was fooled, and &lt;a title="Iraqi Throws Shoes At Bush During Press Conference (VIDEO)" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/14/bush-visits-iraq-for-fina_n_150832.html"&gt;he got a rude surprise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bush had just finished his prepared remarks in which he said the security agreement was made possible by the U.S. surge of troops earlier this year, when the journalist, Muthathar al Zaidi pulled his shoes off and hurled them at the president. "&lt;b&gt;This is a goodbye kiss, you dog&lt;/b&gt;," Zaidi shouted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Bush dodged the shoes and was not struck. Bodyguards quickly wrestled Zaidi to the floor and hauled him, kicking and screaming, from the room. Two other Iraqi journalists were briefly detained after one of them called Zaidi's actions "courageous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catch that last line: journalists were detained for &lt;i&gt;commenting&lt;/i&gt; on this action. I&amp;#39;ll comment, too: I think Zaidi was brave and right. I wish a few American journalists had the guts to throw shoes at the president — they should have started in 2001.

Is it &lt;i&gt;scrumped&lt;/i&gt;? Liz Lemon, I think you just got scrumped!" See it at the end of this clip here (or better yet, &lt;a href="http://www.nbc.com/30_Rock/video/episodes/?vid=873662"&gt;watch the whole episode&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/1rwxprFSrvk%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=480&amp;amp;height=295" width="480" height="295"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intended joke here is that &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scrump"&gt;&lt;i&gt;scrump&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=skrump"&gt;&lt;i&gt;skrump&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; the alternative spelling is irrelevant) is a slang term for sex, with more precise popular definitions ranging from the relatively benign &amp;quot;to have convenient sex; usually brief and decidedly unromantic&amp;quot; to the more disturbing &amp;quot;[t]o physically violate&amp;quot;. (Some believe the word to be a blend of &amp;quot;screw&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hump&amp;quot;; others assume a biblical link to the story of Adam &amp;amp; Eve, euphemistically speaking of &lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrump"&gt;stealing fruit/apples&lt;/a&gt;.) So, Tracy Jordan is informing Liz Lemon that she just got fucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of more-than-casual linguistic interest here is the long-standing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#Connectionism_vs._computationalism_debate"&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt; in the linguistics literature concerning the representation of (certain types of) linguistic knowledge; as it happens, much of this literature focuses on the relation between English verbs and their past tenses. &lt;a href="http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html"&gt;Steven Pinker&lt;/a&gt; developed a synthesis of both sides of this debate and popularized his proposal (in the popular science sense) in his 1999 book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Words-Rules-Ingredients-Language-Science/dp/0465072690"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Words and Rules: The Ingredients of Language&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (This &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_and_Rules"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; provides for a brief summary, a link to &lt;a href="http://www.psichi.org/pdf/pinker.pdf"&gt;a précis&lt;/a&gt; of the book based on a lecture by Pinker, and a &lt;a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n16/yang01_.html"&gt;critical review&lt;/a&gt; of the book by &lt;a href="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/"&gt;Charles Yang&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinker has also relatively recently written a retrospective essay on the debate, "&lt;a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/lrc/prince/11/"&gt;Whatever Happened to the Past Tense Debate?&lt;/a&gt;", which appeared in &lt;a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/lrc/prince/"&gt;a 2006 collection of essays&lt;/a&gt; (edited by me, &lt;a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~ito/"&gt;Junko Ito&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://people.umass.edu/jjmccart/"&gt;John McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;) written in honor of &lt;a href="http://equinox.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/prince.html"&gt;Alan Prince&lt;/a&gt; on the occasion of his 60th birthday. The entire collection is available free from the &lt;a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/"&gt;University of California eScholarship Repository&lt;/a&gt; (if you prefer to pay for bound books, you can buy one &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wondering-Natural/dp/1419646796/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). We (the editors) chose to make the collection available in this way to recognize Prince's early efforts, beginning in 1993, to circulate work in his specific area of interest (Optimality Theory) over the Internet. The &lt;a href="http://roa.rutgers.edu/"&gt;Rutgers Optimality Archive&lt;/a&gt; recently saw its 1000th posting; here is &lt;a href="http://equinox.rutgers.edu/snarl/interface/issues/4-4-N.html"&gt;an interview with Prince&lt;/a&gt; marking this occasion, in which he reflects on the history and impact of the Archive over the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eric Baković</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229284790307"><id gr:original-id="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/?p=233">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b893a2f4ab50d75</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Kathy Sinnott, MEP, and alternative health eurosceptics still associating with Matthias Rath</title><published>2008-12-14T17:29:36Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T17:29:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2008/12/14/kathy-sinnott-mep-and-alternative-health-eurosceptics-still-associating-with-matthias-rath/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">Last month I blogged about the relationship between alternative health eurosceptics, the MEP Kathy Sinnott and the murderous quack Matthias Rath.  During the leadup to that blog post I had corresponded with the MEP Kathy Sinnott and informed her about the reputation and practices of Matthias Rath, while I found it difficult to get Ms [...]</summary><author><name>gimpy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229284790306"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-96088503557170302.post-318764788993163579">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/576d15711cf59f57</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Meditation vs Medication</title><published>2008-12-14T13:05:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T13:05:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/2008/12/meditation-vs-medication.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229283011622"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=912">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b0dd1ca296f34f0a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Errors"/><title type="html">withe</title><published>2008-12-14T19:23:12Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T19:23:12Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=912" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kathryn Burlingham wrote a few days ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'm thinking "withe" should be a recognized contraction [of "with the"]. Happens to me all the time.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;adding, in mail yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can tell you it isn't just a typing phenomenon. I find it in my handwritten things all the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a type of error in writing/typing known as &lt;em&gt;telescoping&lt;/em&gt;: a sequence of two words with some common material at their juncture (TH in this case) is produced as a single word with only one instance of the shared material. (There are more complex cases of telescoping, but this type is especially easy to understand.) And the error is indeed frequent. Searching on "withe" gets over a million raw hits, but most of them are irrelevant. Still, there are plenty of telescoped examples in there.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the irrelevancies, there's the noun &lt;em&gt;withe&lt;/em&gt; 'withy, twig used for binding things together' and the related verb &lt;em&gt;withe&lt;/em&gt; 'to bind with a withe'. Then there's &lt;em&gt;Withe&lt;/em&gt; in names: the English footballer Peter Withe, the Tennessee town Hickory Withe. Plus a surprising number of occurrences of &lt;em&gt;withe&lt;/em&gt; as a typo for &lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt; (as in "black and withe"). And an even larger number that are probably just spellings of &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps in recognition of voicing on the final fricative).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not always clear whether we're looking at telescoped &lt;em&gt;withe&lt;/em&gt; or at &lt;em&gt;withe&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;, especially since the definite article is often omitted in "headline style". Examples like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Re: networking problems withe Linksys router&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2002/03/msg01576.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;could go either way. Some examples, however, are clearly &lt;em&gt;withe&lt;/em&gt; for plain &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leslie Roberts withe George Smitherman&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.cfrb.com/media/728636/Leslie+Roberts+withe+George+Smitherman"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bug #12084, Update temporary tables withe respect to foreign keys. (&lt;a href="http://bugs.mysql.com/12084"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little while I was stumped as to how to hack through this jungle of irrelevancies, but eventually it occurred to me to search on {"with the"} for expressions in which the definite article is required, then search on these expressions with "withe" instead of "with the". Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;yet what can one do but to go withe flow of things… (&lt;a href="http://www.redbubble.com/people/blythart/art/306582-8-197-constables-dedham-coloured-pencils"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first blizzard of the season is hitting us right now: snow is pouring down, the wind is howling, temperatures are in the single digits °F and dropping, and we&amp;#39;re nearing white-out conditions. We&amp;#39;re staying indoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't think our snowflakes look anything like the picture above (from this &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/gallery/dn16170-snowflakes/10"&gt;gallery of snowflake photomicrographs&lt;/a&gt;).

The only bad parts were not getting a chance to hang out with my friends &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/2822957495/in/set-72157607041453990/"&gt;Evo and Sheila&lt;/a&gt; (wrapping the shoot at 8:30 p.m. and having a 6:40 a.m. call time for the next morning puts a damper on the carousing), and the horrendous turbulence on the way home. I have been in bad turbulence before, but this was the first time I was seriously wondering if this Might Be It. We dive bombed a half dozen times, and got seriously tossed around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I made it. I’m home, there’s a beautiful coating of delicate snow on the ground, the Sun is struggling to break through, and I have a bazillion things to get done today. So I’ll leave you for now with the podcast of the interview I did with Little Atoms. &lt;a href="http://www.littleatoms.com/philplait.htm"&gt;Here’s the web page&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.littleatoms.com/sounds/philplait.mp3"&gt;here’s the direct link to the MP3 download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229275009096"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/santa_claus_will_take_you_to_hellthe_vid.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c05bde57a481004e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Politics"/><title type="html">Santa Claus will take you to hell...the video</title><published>2008-12-14T16:07:54Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T16:07:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/484689468/santa_claus_will_take_you_to_hellthe_vid.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/santa_claus_will_take_you_to_hellthe_vid.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/i_cant_believe_it_the_westboro_baptist_c.php"&gt;mentioned how&lt;/a&gt; the ever-warped and evil Westboro Baptist Church wanted in on the Washington State melee in which every religious and antireligion group out there is trying to get a display at the capitol after the state allowed a Christian Nativity scene. Included were the lyrics to a lovely jingle these twisted idiots came up with called &lt;em&gt;Santa Claus Will Take You To Hell&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/12/fred_phelps_wants_in_on_atheis.php"&gt;Ed Brayton&lt;/a&gt; may have posted an image of the actual poster that the WBC wanted to display and reported that the State of Washington, deluged with requests for displays, has &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2008/12/moratorium_on_new_displays_in.php"&gt;declared a moratorium&lt;/a&gt; on new displays until the government can figure out what to do, but I've gone one better. Here's the &lt;a href="http://www.signmovies.net/videos/music/2007/20081211_scwtyth.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of Fred Phelps' cult of hateful loonies actually singing the song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/2YoSkBQkc5E%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have a good beat, and you can't dance to it, as evidenced near the end of the video by the clumsy attempt at a chorus line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. I realize the WBC is an easy target, but it's an easy target because it's about as good an example as there exists for just how badly radical fundamentalist religion can warp people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/santa_claus_will_take_you_to_hellthe_vid.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/484689468" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229274162030"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/there_is_no_pinnacle.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/cf49545f86bd440a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">There is no pinnacle</title><published>2008-12-14T16:27:24Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T16:27:24Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/484693882/there_is_no_pinnacle.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/there_is_no_pinnacle.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/nonsequitur/2008/12/14/"&gt;&lt;img alt="pinnacle.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/14/pinnacle.jpeg" width="300" height="1212"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/there_is_no_pinnacle.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/484693882" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229273468831"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=910">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba8b1a48e9322bfb</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Snowclones"/><title type="html">More virgins</title><published>2008-12-14T16:37:56Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T16:37:56Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=910" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I posted about (among other things) the snowclonelet "X virgin", conveying (roughly) 'someone who hasn't experienced X'. I reported there on two instances with sexual content: "oral virgin" and "anal virgin". There are others, including the fuller versions "oral sex virgin" and "anal sex virgin", the variants "blowjob virgin" and "butt-sex virgin", the pair "gay-sex virgin" and "straight sex virgin", the electronic "phone sex virgin", "cyber-sex virgin", and "Skype sex virgin", plus "pornography virgin" and "porn virgin". No doubt there are more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then W Shore wrote to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope it won't be long before, just as the "electric guitar" created the "acoustic guitar", we begin to hear about "sex virgins." Much like, "I'm a chocoholic, but for alcohol".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestion is that the widespread use of "X virgin" will incline people to create the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retronym"&gt;retronym&lt;/a&gt; "sex virgin" (similar to "acoustic guitar" and "analog watch"). And it's happened; here's a clear example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 15 years old and i am a sex virgin. i get vaginal flatulance … (&lt;a href="http://www.steadyhealth.com/vaginal_flatulence___im_15_and_a_virgin__t108332.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more to be found, but they're very hard to search for; "sex virgin" pulls up vast amounts of irrelevant stuff (plus some of the "X virgin" examples above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addendum: Michael Kleber thought to search on {"a sex virgin"} and found "a crop of examples". Kleber reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;One from 2005 uses it for contrast with another "X virgin" construction:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to you for an hour. I'm just going to go comment crazy here cause youre a myspace virgin.&lt;br&gt;
…and a sex virgin. (&lt;a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;amp;friendID=34228760"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt; And from 2006 there's a lovely bit of parallelism that demanded the "sex virgin" construction: &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would someone do this? I would really like to know. Is it that difficult for a relatively fit and attractive woman to find someone to have sex with?&lt;br&gt;
She may be a sex virgin, but she's an attention whore.

&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing:  all this talk about &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/health/02rage.html"&gt;arrogance in medicine&lt;/a&gt; is a red herring.  It's distracting us from the real question that we should all be asking: how do we improve quality medical care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personality of individual physicians is important, but not very, just as the medical mistakes of individuals have limited significance.  As medicine has become more science-based, we have learned some important lessons about how to prevent and treat disease, and while the physician-patient relationship will always be important, as will the relationship between physicians and other professionals (&lt;a href="http://physioprof.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/korean-airline-pilots-arrogant-physicians-and-life-or-death-decisionmaking/"&gt;see this discussion&lt;/a&gt;), implementing what we know about how to improve health care (and have known for years), will render much of it irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href="http://whitecoatunderground.com/?p=380"&gt;the Keystone program&lt;/a&gt;.  This simple program, &lt;a href="http://www.mhakeystonecenter.org/mediacoverage/Dec%202007%20New%20Yorker%20Article%20The%20Checklist.pdf"&gt;developed at Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mhakeystonecenter.org/"&gt;piloted in Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a few other places,  uses mandatory checklists for certain hospital procedures, and has been shown to reduce complication rates of these procedures.  Unfortunately, bureaucracy threatened to strangle this program in the cradle, but that particular storm has apparently passed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/arrogance_is_a_distractor.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/arrogance_is_a_distractor.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/484655268" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229268549169"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8362667486351515990">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fbf5361f26206430</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Carnival" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Gene Genie #40</title><published>2008-12-14T15:13:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T15:25:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/gene-genie-40.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8362667486351515990/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8362667486351515990" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The 41th edition of Gene Genie has been posted at ScienceRoll [Gene Genie #41: Carnivalome]. &lt;br&gt;Gene Genie is the blog carnival of clinical genetics and personalized medicine.

&lt;p&gt;Yes, on Thursday, December 18, Bing McGhandi over at &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com"&gt;Happy Jihad's House of Pancakes&lt;/a&gt; will be closing out 2008 by &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/12/101st-skeptics-circle-is-up.html"&gt;hosting the 102nd Meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com"&gt;Skeptics' Circle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bing has informed me that he only has three entries as of last night. With only four days to go, that's not good. Come on, skeptics! Do you want to finish out 2008 with a bang or with a whimper? This is not only going to be the last Skeptics' Circle for a year, but it's going to be four weeks between the 102nd and 103rd Meetings of the Skeptics' Circle. The reason is that the next usual date for a Skeptics' Circle installment falls on New Years Day and I didn't want to impose on anyone to be spending their New Years Eve writing a Skeptics' Circle or to be saddled with hosting on a day when blog traffic is virtually guaranteed to be very low. (In my experience, Christmas and New Years Day are reliably the two lowest traffic days of the year, and I like to think that the Skeptics' Circle is a way that bloggers can boost their traffic and incoming links. That's less likely to happen on a major holiday.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, come on! Send your best skeptical blogging to Bing! The contact information is &lt;a href="http://hjhop.blogspot.com/2008/12/101st-skeptics-circle-is-up.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The guidelines are &lt;a href="http://skepticscircle.blogspot.com/2005/10/skeptics-circle-archive-and-schedule.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Let's finish out 2008 with a flurry of great skeptical blogging!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/the_last_skeptics_circle_of_2008.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/484600568" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229267377731"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4732">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c4353251b1bcd6ed</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Boston Skeptics in the Museum Recap</title><published>2008-12-14T15:01:22Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T15:01:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4732" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m cross-posting this event recap from &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=75"&gt;Boston Skeptics&lt;/a&gt;, since this has been such a great week for Skepchick get-togethers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday’s field trip to the Museum of Science was a big success! We had about 40 people show, which I thought would be a logistical nightmare but which turned out to be completely awesome. The Mythical Creatures exhibit was well done with appropriately skeptical and sciencey explanations, and lots of unicorns. The Science of Fear exhibit was, okay, not particularly scary to most of the group but still fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Boston Skeptics at the Museum of Science by Skepchick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3105239899/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3025/3105239899_bdc2222e87_m.jpg" alt="Boston Skeptics at the Museum of Science" width="240" height="180"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We saw two really entertaining shows: one was the indoor lightning demo with the Van Der Graff generator, which included the presenter telling everyone to not just take his word for it, but to explore and experiment and understand for ourselves (but maybe not with a Van Der Graff generator). We also saw a great optical illusions show with a presenter who we all immediately tried to convince to come to Skeptics in the Pub (he might!). A sample of his talk: “You think you can taste chocolate? YOU DON’T TASTE CHOCOLATE, YOU SMELL IT!” He was wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also saw one really, really lame show, but that didn’t really count because technically it was just a tree talking at us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the museum, we hit Porters Bar &amp;amp; Grill for boozy fun. The one big disappointment was that our speaker, Barb Mervine, was literally trapped in New Hampshire with no power or phone thanks to an ill-timed ice storm. So, instead of hearing about UFOs, we were forced to talk to each other. Oh, the humanity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More photos and favorite moments after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a title="Jared with a Unicorn Head by Skepchick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3106074380/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3191/3106074380_c473d45878.jpg" alt="Jared with a Unicorn Head" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Photos weren’t allowed in the Mythical Creatures exhibit, so I took this photo of a Jaredcorn out in the gift shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a title="My Shirt Disappeared! by Skepchick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3106076664/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3015/3106076664_75c21641a6.jpg" alt="My Shirt Disappeared!" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Before entering the exhibit, they took our photo in front of a green screen that happened to match my shirt perfectly. I found this more amusing than I should have, but not amusing enough to pay $20 for the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a title="Josh Fixes 21st Century Computing by Skepchick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3105257161/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/3105257161_64d463ec2e.jpg" alt="Josh Fixes 21st Century Computing" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 21st Century Computing exhibit was borked. As Blake Stacey proclaimed, “Look, a Windows Vista display!” Luckily, we had our own IT guy there to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a title="Guess the Hobo Code! by Skepchick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3105293607/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3091/3105293607_d3ddcdfd80.jpg" alt="Guess the Hobo Code!" width="375" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps my favorite was this Hobo Exhibit. Can you guess the hobo code? &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3105286539/"&gt;Here’s the answer&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, we found &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3105774135/"&gt;ancient hobo codes&lt;/a&gt; as well. Why have I only just noticed that the hobo looks like Josh (above, IT guy)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a title="Twins! by Skepchick, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skepchick/3105770277/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/3105770277_5dfe4401e2.jpg" alt="Twins!" width="375" height="500"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
John came appropriately dressed as his favorite exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

Read the original study and you are pretty much guaranteed to find that the study found almost the complete reverse of what was reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Daily Mail recently reported that &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1090754/Meditation-effective-medication-treating-depression.html"&gt;"Meditation 'as effective as medication' in treating depression&lt;/a&gt;" and the BBC followed with &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7754632.stm"&gt;"Group Therapy 'beats depression'"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As effective? Beats depression?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this one they might have redeemed themselves though, as they’re both only half wrong. What they are talking about is something called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness-based_cognitive_therapy"&gt;Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy&lt;/a&gt; or MBCT. Sounds really sciencey if we just use letters. It’s a form of CBT (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behaviour_therapy"&gt;cognitive behaviour therapy&lt;/a&gt;) which is a therapeutic technique that aims to correct behaviours, emotions and thoughts through a goal-orientated approach. It’s actually an umbrella term for a group of cognitive and behavioural approaches, of which MBCT is one. The paper that prompted both the headlines is &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19045965?ordinalpos=1&amp;amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum"&gt;Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to prevent relapse in recurrent depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Kuyken &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;et al&lt;/span&gt; from the University of Exeter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 'meditation' bit comes about because the therapy uses some meditation techniques. But do not be fooled - MBCT isn’t meditation, it’s a therapy. We’ll deal with the Daily Mail headline a bit later. Never mind whose meditation techniques it uses, does it actually work? For now let’s look at the results:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Daily Mail and the BBC don’t quite agree on how effective it is. The Daily mail says&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;47% of people with long-term depression who underwent the therapy suffered a relapse, compared to 60% of those taking anti-depressant drugs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And the BBC says&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The trial of 123 people found similar relapse rates in those having group therapy and those taking drugs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;So what’s going on? The Daily Mail seems to imply that MBCT is better, while the BBC says they are similar. Is 47% really similar to 60%?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The abstract says&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;MBCT were 47%, compared with 60% in the m-ADM group (hazard ratio = 0.63; 95% confidence interval: 0.39 to 1.04)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Daily Mail got the numbers right. What about the stuff in brackets? The hazard ratio is similar to, but not the same as relative risk. In this study the hazard ratio is a measure of the effect of MBCT on relapse rates. The 95% confidence interval is an estimate of the hazard ratio you would get if you repeated the experiment. But there is something missing…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why haven’t they quoted the statistical significance usually denoted as &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;? Did they forget? Or not think it was very important? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Statistical significance is used to test the null hypothesis – i.e. the hypothesis that there is no effect. I worked out &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; using &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution"&gt;chi-squared&lt;/a&gt; test of significance. I got &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;=0.12. Normally in biomedical sciences p&amp;lt;0.05 is considered to be significant, and so by that standard we have a null result. In other words, for this experiment, 47% is not significantly smaller than 60%. So the BBC would appear to have got it right. Hurrah for the BBC!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NHS website, Behind The Headlines, also &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2008/12December/Pages/Meditationanddepression.aspx"&gt;discusses this paper&lt;/a&gt;. It rightly points out the flaws in the BBC’s and Daily Mail’s reporting. It then goes on to give a few more details about the study. The subjects had received MBCT treatment for the previous six months and were now in either full or partial remission and taking antidepressant medication. There were then randomised to receive a further 8 week course of MBCT or treatment as usual, which meant continuing with anti-depressants. The treatment arm were also offered support to withdraw or lower medication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what exactly is this a study of? The rather innocent sounding (though wordy) title of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy to prevent relapse in recurrent depression&lt;/span&gt;, doesn’t really do it justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So which one is the control group? Which event do you think might have the biggest impact amongst people with depression? Being told that you were going to get another course of MBCT? Or being told that you weren’t going to get one? Participants would have to be willing to participate in another course of MBCT before they could be enrolled in the study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the field of mental health, the placebo effect is very pronounced. It is typically &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;damned&lt;/span&gt; hard for pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate that their latest mood enhancing wonder drug works any better than the placebo. Tell someone that they are going to receive “therapy” to make them better, and lo and behold they start to get better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the literature and you will find that CBT is described as a useful addition to normal drug treatments. So bearing in mind that the placebo effect is very pronounced, what are all these treatments tested against in the control group? Sham therapy? Self help groups? Going to the pub with some friends? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are all compared to &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;treatment as usual&lt;/span&gt;, which usually means treatment with anti-depressants. So the effect could simply be down to the “therapeutic relationship” and nothing to do with the actual therapy. It’s not the therapy that’s making you better, it’s the hour a week you have with your “specialist” telling you that his therapy will make you better, that is making you better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patients getting CBT do better than patients who don’t get CBT, but is it the CBT itself, or the therapeutic relationship that is making them better? It's impossible to tell, until someone devises a placebo based control group. I haven’t found one, but then I don’t have the resources to run systematic searches and analyse the results. If you have a spare afternoon, I guess you could have a some fun searching PubMed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now back to that Daily Mail headline…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Meditation 'as effective as medication' in treating depression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really? Is meditation as effective as medication? Well, probably not according to the &lt;a href="http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD007142/frame.html"&gt;Cochrane Library&lt;/a&gt;. They did conclude that meditation was better than no or minimal treatment on self-related depressive symptoms, but not as good as psychological treatments. So it would appear that patients believe that psychological treatments work better than meditation, which works better than nothing. However doctors weren’t quite so sure - the doctors only noticed a non-significant trend that meditation was better than nothing, and they couldn’t tell the difference between psychological treatments and meditation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Newspapers and the media like to sell us simple stories. If they resonate with a strongly held social belief, then all the better. Usually the real picture is more complicated, and whether we like it or not the “experts” often do not know the answers. What is lost sometimes in the story is the fact that science is not neutral or unemotional or unbiased. It is after all perpetrated by humans. So let’s just ask a couple questions…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why would the researchers of the paper behind the headlines, neglect to mention whether the result was significant or not in the abstract? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wonder if they would have mentioned &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; if the result had been significant? It’s normal practice to state whether the result was significant or not. Try finding a paper without &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; being mentioned. I do find the paper confusing, because I can’t work out what hypothesis they are testing. Maybe they don’t mention &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; because the study appears to be designed to produce a null result anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why is CBT always tested against &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Treatment as Usual&lt;/span&gt; (TAU)? Sure it may be hard to devise and agree on what would constitute a proper placebo, but how else are you going to know whether CBT is not simply itself a placebo? I guess though you’d have to be brave to design a study knowing it could end up disproving years of training and research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, that's no reason not to do it.&lt;br&gt;------------&lt;br&gt;Redlan&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:78%"&gt;&lt;a href="http://layscience.net/bpsdb"&gt;BPSDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/96088503557170302-318764788993163579?l=thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Dr* T</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Thinking Is Dangerous</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://thinking-is-dangerous.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229259021166"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=393">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2c08538d272af4d4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="news"/><title type="html">Scientists are Baffled</title><published>2008-12-14T12:46:02Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T12:46:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=393" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;We joke about that phrase a lot on the show. It’s a tired cliche - a cheap way to sensationalize science news reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/science/12/12/acorn.shortage/index.html?iref=mpstoryview"&gt;recent story&lt;/a&gt; from CNN: “Scientists are baffled by mysterious acorn shortage.” That’s right, in the northeast US there has been a significant decrease in the acorn crop this year. Some areas report no acorns at all. This is actually an interesting science news story, and the body of the story contains what seems to be the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turns out that scientists are not baffled at all. Acorn crops run in cycles. Last year there was a bumper crop - much larger than normal. Bumper crops tend to be followed by lean crops as the trees now need to conserve resources. This cycle may have been exagerated by a wet spring, which also tends to decrease acorn production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also brings up some legitimate speculation, even if it plays it up a bit. If this lean year becomes part of a trend, then perhaps some other concerning factor is at work. That’s a big “if” though - cycles are cyclical and there is no reason to suspect that any particular downturn in a cycle is actually part of a new downward trend. We don’t worry every winter that the earth may be entering an iceage - if trends continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article also brings up the fact that squirrels and deer depend upon acorns in their diet, and so they will be stressed this winter. They put it into a good perseptive, thought. Wild animals are resourceful. Sure, their populations may take a small hit, but they will survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also personally very interested in the fact that squirrels, in search of altnerate food sources, may increase their raids on bird feeders. Anyone in regions populated by squirrels who maintains a bird feeder is well aware of how clever and acrobatic squirrels can be in acquiring food. There is actually an arms race between squirrels and bird feeder technology, and the squirrels generally win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are some pretty impenetrable bird feeders out there, but I was surprised at the lengths one has to go to in order to keep squirrels from devouring your bird seed. I purchased several “squirrel baffles” (yes, that is what they are called) which did not baffle the squirrels for long. It seems that scientists are much easier to baffle than squirrels. For me the only solution was a large dog who likes to spend his days “on patrol” - keeping our yard free of critters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of the acorn shortage article was therefore informative, interesting, and thorough, with my only minor complaint that they played up the concern a bit too much. And I know that headline writers are usually not the authors of the article and do no consult with the authors or get their approval. Headlines are meant to grab attention, not accurately reflect the content of the article they head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This state of affairs has lead to its own category of cliches - the headline cliche. We just have to accept the fact that every new fossil is a “missing link,” every new discovery is a “breakthrough,” the smallest of minority opinions will render any issue a “controversy,” and even the slightest uncertainty means that scientists are “baffled.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229247927781"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-2321961780779839926">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/09772fd3ddcf76f4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Could the Rapture Have Already Occurred?</title><published>2008-12-14T04:39:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-14T04:43:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/484261744/could-rapture-have-already-occurred_4548.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/2321961780779839926/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=2321961780779839926" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/could-rapture-have-already-occurred_4548.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_eJQiRrfoU4I/SUSOfQlYcsI/AAAAAAAAAEs/OSAfJqLwdso/s1600-h/cemertary.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT:left;MARGIN:0px 10px 10px 0px;WIDTH:320px;HEIGHT:210px" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_eJQiRrfoU4I/SUSOfQlYcsI/AAAAAAAAAEs/OSAfJqLwdso/s320/cemertary.jpg" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;The picture is of a cemetery headstone I photographed in the grave yard of a Baptist church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the epitaph, William Orr died at age 73 and either Lethe has the Methuselah gene as Mrs. Orr is now 154 years old or she has been raptured out of this world to be with Jesus. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottom of the tombstone states clearly: &lt;em&gt;Gone but not forgotten.&lt;/em&gt; And a closer inspection proved that only Mr. Orr’s grave had been used.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I ask; is it just possible that Mr. Orr was unsaved and his body is still in the grave while his soul is in Hell awaiting the final judgment while Mrs. Orr was raptured out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or do you think that Lethe is still alive and kicking at 154 years old because she has the Methuselah gene ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, this is some theological food for thought and a point for discussion on the lighter side here at DC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Loftus, proposes the outsider test for faith. He defines the outsider test for religious faith as simply "a challenge to test one's own religious faith with the presumption of skepticism, as an outsider (&lt;em&gt;Why I Became an Atheist&lt;/em&gt;, p. 66)." This chapter is being heralded by his peers and has gained Loftus a place of honor among the new Atheists. I would have to concur that the entire work, and this chapter in particular, is top-notch work among all his contemporaries. Until this point, I considered Hitchens to be the best read among the atheists because of his humor and style, but Loftus seems to put forth better arguments that stay on task and address relevant points. I assume this is due to his experience and knowledge gained from once being on the inside.&lt;/blockquote&gt;To read more &lt;a href="http://molinist.blogspot.com/2008/12/outsider-test-for-faith.html"&gt;here is the Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Coincidentally, it's in &lt;a href="http://weekendamerica.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/12/13/cocktail_hour/"&gt;this short segment&lt;/a&gt; on holiday parties and cocktails, very near the beginning in fact, so take a listen if you care to. Here's the noun phrase in context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time of year weekends are a time for holiday parties, and all the traditions that go along with holiday parties. You know, the sweaters that you only wear just that one time of year, &lt;b&gt;the conversations that you end up in with people who you're trying to remember the names of all the way through but you kinda smile and fake your way through&lt;/b&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the tree. (Click it to enlarge.) Below it is the bracketed text that I used to generate the tree with the oh-so-cool &lt;a href="http://ironcreek.net/phpsyntaxtree/"&gt;phpsyntaxtree&lt;/a&gt; ("drawing syntax trees made easy"). Those of you with an eye for this sort of thing will notice, first of all, that the tree is relatively old-school (e.g. S-bar, Comp, Aux, non-binary branching, etc.), and that I've made a few, possibly idiosyncratic decisions about some things (e.g. the consituency of &lt;i&gt;end up&lt;/i&gt;, that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; is a P, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/best-np-ever.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/best-np-ever.png" alt="" title="best-np-ever" width="500" height="231"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[NP [Det the] [N conversations_i] [S' [Comp that] [S [NP you] [VP [V end up] [PP [P in] [NP t_i]] [PP [P with] [NP [N people_j] [S' [NP who_j] [S [S [NP you_k] [Aux 're] [VP [V trying] [S [NP PRO_k] [Aux to] [VP [V remember] [NP [Det the] [N names] [PP [P of] [NP t_j]]] [PP [P all] [NP [Det the] [N way] [PP [P through] [NP t_i]]]]]]]] [Conj but] [S [NP you] [VP [Adv kinda] [VP [VP [V smile]] [Conj and] [VP [V fake] [NP [NP your] [N way] [PP [P through] [NP t_i]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two most relevant things to note about the tree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first head noun &lt;i&gt;conversations&lt;/i&gt; appears to be understood as the object of three prepositions: (1) the &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;you end up in&lt;/i&gt;, (2) the &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;all the way through&lt;/i&gt;, and (3) the &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;fake your way through&lt;/i&gt;. (Some may wish to argue that one or both &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt;s are intransitive versions of these prepositions; I would respectfully disagree.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next head noun &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;, via its link to the &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; initiating the following relative clause, is understood as the object of the preposition &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;remember the names of&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#39;ve said many times before — always as an excuse, like this time, for not bothering to go into too much detail — I&amp;#39;m not a syntactician. (I&amp;#39;ve &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=657"&gt;gotten in trouble&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=647"&gt;delving too deeply&lt;/a&gt; into this area before; &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=647#comment-10198"&gt;Kai advised me&lt;/a&gt; to leave such things alone, but I just can't help myself.) So, I leave the comments open in case any real syntacticians among our readers want to add comments on this example. Of course, this will most likely also serve as an open invitation for a bunch of amateurs to put in their two cents about whatever fancies them about the noun phrase. Oh, well, so be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="red"&gt;Update:&lt;/font&gt; Of course, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=908#comment-14490"&gt;Lance&lt;/a&gt; is right. Here's the corrected tree:&lt;/p&gt;

It’s by a representative of the &lt;a href="http://www.sabbsa.org/" rel="external "&gt;San Antonio Bible Based Sciences Association&lt;/a&gt;, and argues that teaching the “strengths and weaknesses” of evolution is perfectly appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Op-Ed then lists some of the so-called “scientific weaknesses of evolution,” and they are a litany of the worst creationist arguments, including these old chestnuts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We stand ready to go to any venue you invite us to, and can present several hours of scientific evidence which supports creation. Included in these will be the fact that evolution violates the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; Laws of Thermodynamics, as well as the Law of Biogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can show you creation evidence in the fields of microbiology, genetics, probability, biochemistry, biology, geology and physics which support creation and undermine evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, all of modern science is bunkum.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruising to the linked website, one finds the &lt;a href="http://www.sabbsa.org/SofF.htm" rel="external "&gt;statement of faith of SABBSA&lt;/a&gt;.  The first paragraph is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SABBSA strives to be a Christian, evangelical, creation organization which believes the Bible from the very first verse. We facilitate the revealing of God’s creation in our world and provide creation science education to our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We further testify that Genesis is not allegorical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s no religious agenda.  Nope, not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site also offers “colorful, hour-long Powerpoint presentations” (complete with presenter) on such topics as &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to Creation Theories&lt;/strong&gt; this presentation covers the full continuum of theories between evolution and creation. It includes capsules on the compromise theories of scientific creationism, gap theory, day/age theory, intelligent design, progressive creationism, and theistic evolution. It sets the stage for all further presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No theological compromises for these guys: It’s six days or nothing.  Another example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Young Earth Evidences&lt;/strong&gt; This striking presentation shows that there is far more scientific evidence for a relatively young Earth than for an exceedingly old one. These evidences fit well into the creation theory and coincide with a biblical timescale, but they are devastating to evolution which requires massive amounts of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you get the idea.  It’s a compendium of the &lt;a href="http://toarchive.org/indexcc/" rel="external "&gt;Index to Creationist Claims&lt;/a&gt; offered as “weaknesses of evolution.”  (Note that the TO URL is a temporary stopgap while a problem with the main TO server is being worked on.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t resist one more.  In the &lt;a href="http://www.sabbsa.org/calendar.htm" rel="external "&gt;SABBSA Events Calendar&lt;/a&gt; there’s a blurb about a visit from “Dr.” Carl Baugh earlier this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carl Baugh visited San Antonio in a big way! His presentation, “Set in Stone.” showed the interpretation of the “rocks” as evolutionists see them and the evidence in the rocks of a “special creation.” There were more than 150 people in attendance at Castle Hills First Baptist Church. Dr. Baugh was introduced by SABBSA’s Dr. Carl Williams who explained the need for Creation Ministry and why Dr. Baugh’s message is so relevant today. The climax of the evening was the unveiling of two very special archaeological finds. These two fossils, the Willet and Alvis-Dalk footprints were on only their third public exhibition. These finds prove that man and dinosaurs coexisted in the not so distant past. Read our July newsletter for a complete summary of Dr. Baugh’s talk and these two pieces of very special creation evidence. We are putting together an educational video of this event and will make it available to the public at our cost in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can’t wait to see that video!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As John Pieret remarked in his post, the kicker is this: The author of the Op-Ed and the contact person for SABBSA is a &lt;em&gt;public school math and science teacher&lt;/em&gt;.  This is the kind of “science” that is enabled by the “strengths and weaknesses” language.  There’s a whole lot of Dover Traps out there waiting to be sprung.&lt;/p&gt;

While this was discussed largely in the context of a fascinating long-term experiment begun by K. W. Jeon and colleagues in the 1960’s, it is also relevant to the origins of more identifiable organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.  Which brings me to another matter, a line of experimentation that shows yet another case whereby macroevolutionary change can be studied by direct experimentation, almost in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The progression from symbiont to organelle involves many steps or processes.  Among these is a migration of genes from the symbiont genome to the host genome.  The end results of such migrations may be seen in the genomes of modern eukaryotes; thus, nuclear genomes are “littered” with genes that are derived from prokaryotic ancestors, but are expressed as eukaryotic genes and whose protein products end up in the organelle. Attendant with such migrations have been a number a number of changes, modifications that would permit the new nuclear gene to be expressed, and its protein product to be transported from the cytoplasm into the organelle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, studies of these migrations have been matters of sequence comparisons and analyses.  These approaches are very informative, and have told us about the ancestry of the relevant genes.  However, for the most part, matters of mechanism have been harder nuts to crack, largely because it had been assumed that migratory events occur on an evolutionary time scale, and thus that they would be unlikely to be caught “in the act”.  Recent studies reveal that this is not the case.  Briefly, it is now known that gene migration from organelle to nucleus can be observed and studied in real time, and that questions pertaining to the “activation” of organellar genes after migration to the nucleus can be asked (and answered).  In other words, this sort of macroevolutionary change can be studied as it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more to this story, some of which may be found &lt;a href="http://aghunt.wordpress.com/2008/11/16/transplastomics-%e2%80%93-a-convergence-of-biotechnology-and-evolution/" rel="external "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where comments may also be left.  (As a further teaser, I would note that this phenomenon impacts the field of biotechnology and GMOs.)  The bottom line is simple, though - macroevolutionary changes involving gene migration can be studied in real time, once again putting the lie to the ID/antievolutionist assertion that macroevolution cannot be addressed experimentally.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victorian state primary school students will soon have an alternative -- religious education lessons taught by people who do not believe in God and say there is "no evidence of any supernatural power".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Humanist Society of Victoria has developed a curriculum, which the State Government accreditation body says it intends to approve, to deliver 30-minute lessons each week of "humanist applied ethics" to primary pupils.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Accredited volunteers will be able to teach their philosophy in the class time designated for religious instruction. As with lessons delivered by faith groups, parents will be able to request that their children do not participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now the fun part. The religious are complaining, of course. The fundies are saying this opens the door to all kinds of wacko religions to get equal time in the schools.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentalist Christian group the Salt Shakers panned the idea of humanists being given religious education class time.

Research director Jenny Stokes said: "If you go there, where do you stop? What about witchcraft or Satanism?

"If you accredit humanism, then those things would have an equal claim to be taught in schools."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, witchcraft and satanism are no crazier than Christianity, so I don't see the point of the argument. What's even funnier, though, is that the groups with a vested interest in supporting the mainstream religions have a completely different argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the body that accredits Victoria's 3500 Christian religious instruction volunteers, Access Ministries, says humanism is not a religion and so should not be taught in religious education time.
Access Ministries now teaches in about two-thirds of state primary schools. Other accredited instructors teach Judaism, Buddhism and Baha'i.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Humanist Society does not consider itself to be a religious organisation and believes ethics have "no necessary connection with religion". Humanists believe people are responsible for their own destiny and reject the notion of a supernatural force or God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they can't let a secular ethics taught because it's a religion, and we can't let it be taught because it is not a religion. I say let those two groups fight it out while the secular humanists just do their good ol' rational thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I recently got an offer from someone at No-Starch Press to review the
newly translated book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593271891?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1593271891"&gt;The Manga Guide to Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=goodmathbadma-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=1593271891" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none!important;margin:0px!important"&gt;. I recieved the book a couple of weeks ago, but haven't had time to sit down and read it until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If you haven't heard of the "Manga Guides", they're an interesting idea. In Japan, comic books ("Manga") are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more common and socially accepte than they typically are in the US. It's not at all unusual to see Japanese adults sitting in the subway reading Manga. Manga has a very distinctive artistic style, with its own
set of common artistic conventions. The Manga Guides are textbooks written as
Manga-style comics. In this case, it's an introductory text on statistics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The short version of the review: terrific book; engaging, thorough, and fun. Highly recommended.

There is simply no mechanism by which it can bother you, and better than that, there is really no evidence that the actual tiny emmissions from any radio device actually affects anyone, mechanism or not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But you should read the full article.  It includes easy to follow explanations of, for example, microwave radiation, and why microwaves from a DECT device will not cook you although a microwave oven does cook food. (Hint: the cooking is not due to the effects of ionizing radiation.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When anyone starts talking about radiation and radio wave scares, electro-sensitivity or anything similar, the &lt;a href="http://techskeptic.blogspot.com/2008/12/dect-scares.html"&gt;DECT scares&lt;/a&gt; post would be a good place to refer them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229206031175"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=907">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/26dc8ae21e37e27c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Language play"/><category term="Names"/><title type="html">Strictly what?</title><published>2008-12-13T21:49:29Z</published><updated>2008-12-13T21:49:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=907" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;For some time now I have been in syntactic pain over what appeared to be a TV show in the UK with a completely ungrammatical title.  It's a competitive ballroom dancing show on BBC TV, compered by the octogenarian Bruce Forsyth (who after what must be half a century on TV is &lt;b&gt;still&lt;/b&gt; using his catchphrase greeting "Nice to see you, to see you, nice" every single time he confronts a camera).  The name of the show is &lt;i&gt;Strictly Come Dancing&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was baffled by it.  It doesn't seem to have a parse at all. You simply can't use a manner adverb like &lt;i&gt;strictly&lt;/i&gt; to modify an invitation like &amp;quot;Come dancing&amp;quot;.  What on earth was going on?  It was many months before I realized that almost certainly Wikipedia would reveal all for me, if I just swallowed my foolish pride and looked the show up.  Wikipedia — always great on showbiz topics — did not let me down.  And I could have kicked myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so simple.  There was once a ballroom dancing show on BBC TV called &lt;i&gt;Come Dancing&lt;/i&gt; (I knew that).  And in 1992 there was an Australian romantic comedy film called &lt;i&gt;Strictly Ballroom&lt;/i&gt; (I'm sure I had heard of it).  The makers of the new program just glued bits of the two titles together to make a blend that alluded to both.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm probably one of the only people in the English-speaking world who didn't get it.  Which is a bit embarrassing, what with me being a Language Log senior writer and purportedly a big language maven and all.  My job is probably on the line here.  Just promise not to spread it around that I didn't spot the allusion, OK?  I don't want to look more stupid than absolutely necessary.  Probably hardly anyone but you will have read this post through to the end.  It'll just be our little secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added later:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sridhar Ramesh writes to me to point out that "were it not for Wikipedia, many&lt;br&gt;
of us would have difficulty appreciating even the title "Strictly Ballroom" as strictly grammatical."  It is an excellent point.  Why is &lt;i&gt;strictly&lt;/i&gt; here allowed as (apparently) a pre-head modifier of a noun, &lt;i&gt;ballroom&lt;/i&gt;?  Because it really means &lt;i&gt;strictly ballroom dancing&lt;/i&gt;, i.e., falling within the strict definition of the special kinds of dancing known as ballroom dancing.  The adverb modifies an attributive modifier (&lt;i&gt;ballroom&lt;/i&gt;) of a noun (&lt;i&gt;dancing&lt;/i&gt;, derived from a gerund-participle of a verb) that has been omitted.  This is indeed a difficult phrase to analyse.  Maybe I'm not so dumb to have had trouble with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Ian Preston points out to me that Bruce Forsyth and co-host Tess Daly, while typically using the phrase "Keep dancing" to end the show, at one point took to replacing it with the catchphrase "Keep strictly".  I don't know what to say about this.  But note that the present post is categorized under "Language play".&lt;/p&gt;

I was in college, and I hadn’t heard of it. A friend told me he heard the movie rocked. So we went to see it, and after the first 15 minutes or so I was not convinced. But it kept getting better, and finally, by the end, I was a believer. The movie was awesome. And the time travel was internally consistent! Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw T2 in grad school, and I couldn’t believe a sequel could be that much better than the original movie, which was already pretty excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw T3 and realized that sometimes sequels suck. In fact, the story line wasn’t bad, but the production values weren’t terribly high, and the acting/directing made it feel like it was made for TV. The sweep of the first two movies was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now they’re making T4. I think it continues on from T3, which would be too bad, but maybe they can make it work. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRwby_vjg88"&gt;The trailer&lt;/a&gt; is… interesting. Not sure what to make of it, but I guess soon enough we’ll find out.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now, you'll have to settle for answering this question: &lt;a title="The Aiken Standard - Poll Results" href="http://access.aikenstandard.com/pollBooth.php?pollID=169"&gt;What do you think of the decision to block the "I Believe" license plate?&lt;/a&gt; The results so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good. The plates are a violation of church and state 18.16 % (69)&lt;br&gt;

I disagree with the ruling. I have a right to show my faith 63.95 % (243)&lt;br&gt;

They should get rid of all vanity plates and have one standard design for the state 17.89 % (68)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and so far winning (but you'll turn that around fast), choice is palpably stupid. Of course you have a right to display your faith! Slap a Jesus fish and a bunch of bumper stickers on your car. Go out and get a vanity license plate frame that is dripping with crosses.

You must read &lt;a href="http://de-conversion.com/2008/11/01/failing-the-insider-test/"&gt;this well-written story&lt;/a&gt; of a Christian who lost his faith even as an insider. My question is why God would allow so many insiders like us to lose our faith? Why, for instance, if the evidence favors Christian theism, do so many of us leave it even when approaching it from an insider's perspective (or presumption) that it's true? We can just forget about the outsider test. Christianity doesn't even pass the insider test! In any case, this is a heart wrenching story (notice him struggle!). Here are some interesting quotes from it: &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There’s just something about explaining theological concepts to a hostile audience that reveals just how convoluted the arguments are. By the end of the summer, when I thought about religion, neither of us had to open our mouths for my faith to get stomped – the internal skeptic in me was stronger than the Christian in me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I began taking an online theology class that switched me from presuppositional apologetics to evidential apologetics. You mean I don’t have to assume the Bible is true a priori, but there’s actual evidence for it? Hallelujah!&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While I had suspected I was losing my faith off and on for over three years, I didn’t think there was a chance I actually would, even up until the moment it happened. I sincerely believed it was true, and thus I believed that sincerely seeking the truth would lead me to God in some way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;On April 19, 2008, I went to see the movie “Expelled.” I was unsurprised to see ID propaganda, but what surprised me was how many arguments for atheism were presented and how good they looked when paired with Christianity’s most foolish tenants. As far as I was concerned, the movie ended when Dawkins was asked what he would say to God were he to meet him after death. Dawkins replied, “Why did you take such pains to conceal yourself?” This retort was crushing as I thought about my lack of a relationship with God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When I finally de-converted, I could best describe it as the final scene in a mystery movie, where the detective has been following the bad guy for a while, and finds the smallest clue out of place. A montage follows as he remembers the dozens of times something was amiss, and one-by-one, puts the clues in the proper position and sees he has enough evidence to convict the real villain several times over. After I de-converted, my first thought was “Wow … What took me so long?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But my second thought was that I had just lost something very dear to me. My identity and purpose for living have been ripped violently away. I have to completely reforge what I think about everything. “Why don’t I just kill myself” was a thought that went through my mind – not that I was actually suicidal, but why not? Instead of protecting myself socially from ungodly influences, I have to find a way to re-enter the world without God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But the more I know about a secular view of the world, the better it gets. I no longer need a belief in a second life to make this first one precious. Far from being nihilistic, I care about humanity with a passion that I seldom had as a Christian. God isn’t helping us – the only peace and justice to be found in this world are the peace and justice we fight for. I’m finding in free thought more morality and purpose than I ever found in Christianity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Since I’ll be gone, here is some stuff to keep you from doing anything useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Dave Mosher at Discovery’s blog (note the y) is hosting &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovery.com/space_disco/2008/12/carnival-space.html"&gt;the 82nd Carnival of Space&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a special first-time video edition! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) New Scientist &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/gallery/dn16254-damage-that-derailed-higgs-hunt/1"&gt;has pictures of the LHC damage&lt;/a&gt;. They’re… interesting, but I was hoping for more drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2008/12/10/hirise-wows-again-this-time-in-3-d/"&gt;Universe Today has an even cooler Mars 3D anaglyph&lt;/a&gt; than the one I recently posted. And I forgot to mention that &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/HiRISE"&gt;HiRISE is on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;! Also, the parent spacecraft, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, just finished its nominal two-year mission. Congrats! May it get extended for ten more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Check out &lt;a href="http://www.umpi.maine.edu/info/nmms/solar/index.htm"&gt;this way cool scale solar system model&lt;/a&gt; in Maine! BABLoggee Vernon Balbert sent that one in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Anti-anti-vax heroes Paul Offitt and Amanda Peet &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97940354&amp;amp;ft=1&amp;amp;f=1027"&gt;were on NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) That planet 63 light years away with carbon dioxide in its atmosphere? &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081210/full/news.2008.1289.html"&gt;Water vapor has been found as well&lt;/a&gt;.

After all, how can someone get seriously upset when they're wished "Happy Holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas"? It's been ridiculous from the get-go. Well, Max Blumenthal has traced the meme back in an article on &lt;a title="Who Started the War on Christmas? - The Daily Beast " href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-12-09/who-started-the-war-on-christmas"&gt;who started the War on Christmas&lt;/a&gt;, and you probably won't be too surprised: it originated in racist kooks who blamed foreigners and Jews for all of the nation's ills. Notice that when people talk about the War on Christmas, they rarely mention who's waging it. It's unspoken but understood on the far right that this is a war with Jews and immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly &lt;a href="http://dneiwert.blogspot.com/"&gt;Orcinus&lt;/a&gt; territory. Dave Neiwert has often made the argument that right-wing radio and TV exists to mainstream the worst ideas of racist extremists, and that the war on Christmas can migrate from the racist founder of the odious VDare website to a daily rant on Bill O'Reilly's cable show is a perfect example of the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, let us turn our attention and notice what the New Covenant tells us as revealed by our Lord Himself relating to women and marriage as He Himself set our example:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But He said to them, "Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it." (Matthew 19: 11-12).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the most Holy Apostle Paul:  “Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman….But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.  But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.” (I Corinth. 7: 1, 8, &amp;amp; 9).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And finally our Lord again emphasizes his divine requirements for us to be holy even has He is holy and unmarried in the Apocalypse:  “ Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.  And I heard a voice from heaven, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder, and the voice which I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps. And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.  These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.  And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.” (Revelation 14: 1-5).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beloved, I ask you to examine your sinful life while you are here in your temporary earthen vessel of clay in light our beloved Savior Jesus Christ, the Holy Apostle Paul and the 144,000 virgin men who followed the Lamb in Revelation and to renounced any sexual sin as a venal sin by which you can make it into Heaven but, as St. Paul says “each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work.  If any man’s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.  If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.”  (I Corinth. 3: 13 - 15).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, may the Virgin of Our Lady of Guadalupe be an example before Christ for us.  Amen  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It just &lt;i&gt;happens&lt;/i&gt; that there's a direct correlation between religious belief and the ignorant criticism of evolution. It's not all science. Just that one area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh yeah. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7767192.stm"&gt;And nanotechnology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The article also said that mistrust of "the internet, genetically modified food, nuclear power" and other things tended to go along with distrust in nanotechnology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, religion gives people a general sense of paranoia in which everything's turned into another demon from which they need saving. Forget that pesky reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The researchers say their finding support the idea that underlying cultural beliefs have a stronger influence on opinions formed about nanotechnology than science based information".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Duh.&lt;div&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25327006-1427872990726616094?l=angryastronomer.blogspot.com"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Voisey</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default</id><title type="html">Angry Astronomer</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://angryastronomer.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229137113959"><id gr:original-id="http://draust.wordpress.com/?p=235">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/aae9d6042f89709f</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">The Tragic Human Cost of Political Idiocy and AIDS Pseudoscience</title><published>2008-12-13T00:16:49Z</published><updated>2008-12-13T00:16:49Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://draust.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/the-tragic-human-cost-of-political-idiocy-and-aids-pseudoscience/" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.badscienceblogs.net/" type="html">In which Dr Aust ruminates somewhat unoriginally on the desperate consequences of delusional thinking about medicine… when the deluded are the people running the country.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth and the Catapult, "Golden Ink"&lt;/b&gt;: a mellow track from a very
 good NY area band. This really isn't one of my favorites of their songs. It's rather on the dull side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Miles Davis, "Ray's Idea"&lt;/b&gt;: Miles is one of the great geniuses of the 20th century. What more need be said?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do Make Say Think, "Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!"&lt;/b&gt;: DMSY is one of the very
  best post-rock ensembles you'll find. They're another group that overlaps with
  Godspeed You Black Emperor, and they approach the brilliance that is Godspeed. 
  This is a nice mellow track, with some lovely steel guitar playing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Tangent, "Photosynthesis"&lt;/b&gt;: great neo-progressive stuff. This band started off as a collaboration between Roine Stolte of the Flower Kings and
Andy Tillson. This is off the first Tangent album after Stolte and Tillson had a falling out. The band still features some members of tFK, but the writing is now
pretty much all Tillson. They're an excellent band, but I did prefer their sound with Stolte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "Splintering Heart"&lt;/b&gt;: the best track off of a frankly lousy
  Marillion album. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gogol Bordello, "Not a Crime"&lt;/b&gt;: Gypsy punk rock, with brilliant fiddle
  playing. What could be cooler than that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mel Brooks, "Springtime for Hitler"&lt;/b&gt;: A song from one of the most brilliantly offensive shows of all time. The original movie remains one of my very favorite movies. Come on, how can you not love the blue blankie? Or Mel Brooks stepping out of a dance line to sing "Don't be stupid, be a smarty, come and join the nazi party?"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marillion, "Throw Me Out"&lt;/b&gt;: something off of Marillion's new double album. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; this album. It's the best thing from Marillion in ages. I can't stop listening to it. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is why I love Marillion. Brilliant songwriting, amazing technical performances, music loaded with feeling, and those astonishingly wonderful Marillion transitions. Even a short little song like this manages to be just
brilliant, with so many little treasures hidden in it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pink Floyd, "The Dogs of War"&lt;/b&gt;: It's a damn shame that David Gilmour got control of the Pink Floyd name, and chose te release so much crap under it. He's a wonderful guitarist, but frankly, he's a pretty rotten songwriter. All of his compositions have this dull droning quality to them. This is typical. There's some nice guitar work in the live version, but the song itself is just dreck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy the Man, "Maui Sunset"&lt;/b&gt;: I was delighted when I heard Happy the Man was getting back together. I wasn't so delighted once I heard what they did. It's got all of the technical qualities of good progressive rock: complex melodies and harmonies, interesting chord progressions, complex and irregular rythyms. But it's &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt;. It sounds like music performed by a computer. There's not a trace of humanity to it. Technically brilliant, but ultimately remarkably dull.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who came out for last night’s Drinking Skepchickally in San Diego.  The bar was schwanky, the food was fantastic (ask A about the “tater tots” she ordered), and the drinks were good (though we ordered so many dirty martinis that we depleted their olive supply; i think my last one was basically vodka with a little splash of olive brine).  Having said all that, I would have been happy just due to the fact that I could be outside with no jacket and not freeze (apparently it was -2ºF back in MN this morning).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a dozen people showed up, and a good time was had by all.  We had virtual guests as well:  &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://skepticzone.tv/"&gt;Richard Saunders&lt;/a&gt; each joined us for a little while via Skype , though it was nearly impossible to hear on my little Mac speakers over the bar noise, so despite being completely geeky, it didn’t work quite as well as we’d imagined.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More pictures after the fold. &lt;/p&gt;

It generally takes the form of seeing a face, but you only tend to hear about it when someone sees a religious icon. Jesus in a cabinet’s wood grain, Mary in an oil slick, Mohammed in a tree, Buddha in a wasp nest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wptv.com/mostpopular/story/Local-woman-claims-to-find-Virgin-Mary-image-in/BlY_gVLVnUmXpTJ72F4adQ.cspx"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/pareidolia_mri_mary.jpg" alt="Virgin Mary in a brain MRI"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wptv.com/mostpopular/story/Local-woman-claims-to-find-Virgin-Mary-image-in/BlY_gVLVnUmXpTJ72F4adQ.cspx"&gt;The latest comes from Florida&lt;/a&gt;. A woman, Pamela Latrimore, who is evidently quite ill and having trouble making her bill payments, sees Mary in her brain MRI. She’s religious, and takes this as a sign to sell the image on eBay. OK, fine. She’s ill, and if she takes comfort in this then that’s understandable, even if I disagree with her interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear here: I understand that people read their own viewpoints and prejudices into pareidolia. Ms. Latrimore is religious and sees the Virgin Mary; I love science fiction and I see Chewbacca (on &amp;quot;Mary’s&amp;quot; belly). Latrimore is steeped in a religious viewpoint, and so she sees this through that filter, and again, while I disagree with her it’s understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am not so forgiving of the media. The online article linked above from NBC5 in West Palm Beach, like every other news venue when they report on this topic, gives this story straight, with no mention at all that this may just be coincidence (which it most certainly is), and present only dismissive lip service to people who disagree with the conclusion that this is a holy image. Worse, they have a video link which says &amp;quot;Click on the video player to the right to watch the story, and decide for yourself.&amp;quot; That strikes me as being the antithesis of news reporting; how can a viewer decide anything when the reporting is so one-sided?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I watch local news &amp;quot;human interest&amp;quot; stories, the more I think they work against the interest of humans. It is not terribly hard to present this story fairly without being cruel — Latrimore reportedly is, after all, quite ill and deserves sympathy — but I keep finding that journalists, especially on TV, are becoming so lazy that there is no research at all going on. It’s just reporting, stenography, and it’s not even complete. Ghosts, pareidolia, psychics… how many times have you seen more than five seconds devoted to the skeptical (that is, reality-based) side of these topics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah well. That’s the way of things these days, and it just means we have to work harder, get our message out even more, and stay on top of such things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: After drafting this post, I found out my friend and fellow skeptic Steve Novella &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=436"&gt;has written about this event as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lots of ‘non-skeptic’ friends and sometimes it can be difficult to explain what I’m doing in the skeptical community.  So today’s question is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is a skeptic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do you define it to a non-skeptic?&lt;/p&gt;

Few religious loonies bring the hate home in a more concentrated fashion than Phelps and his not-so-merry band of homophobic nutcases. Whether it be &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/10/is_there_no_depths_to_which_these_people.php"&gt;threatening to picket&lt;/a&gt; the funerals of Amish girls killed in a school shooting, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/religious_nutjobs_at_their_wor.php"&gt;showing up on TV&lt;/a&gt; to spew hate against homosexuals and anyone who doesn't agree with their particularly twisted brand of fundamentalist Christianity, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/09/the_rev_fred_phelps_on_stephen_colbert_a.php"&gt;planning pickets&lt;/a&gt; at the memorial for the passengers and crew of Flight 93, or &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/01/belated-happy-new-year.html"&gt;praising God for the tsunami&lt;/a&gt; four years ago, few people can bring the religious crazy to the masses in such a flamboyantly hateful manner as Fred Phelps and his posse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, sometimes Phelps comes up with something that's actually rather funny, albeit unintentionally. (If there's one thing about Phelps and his fellow cultists, it's that they utterly lack a sense of humor.) And he actually made me chuckle a bit (although it may be due to &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/em&gt;) by &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/thebigblog/archives/156716.asp"&gt;wanting to include this&lt;/a&gt; in a Christmas display at the Washington State capitol:&lt;/p&gt;

Rebecca upgraded the site! You probably can’t tell, actually, except for that last night for about 20 minutes the site went down, and then this morning the recent comments list (over there on the right) was screwy because it was showing giant Gravatars with each new comment. Sorry about that! I fixed it so now the site is back and there are itty bitty Gravatars by your recent comments. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Comment o’ the Week, there were hardly any noms, and of the noms I actually saw, two were for Skepchick writers and one was for a person quoted in an article who doesn’t actually comment on Skepchick (as far as I know – if it so happens that &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7767877.stm"&gt;Dr. Rosalind Arden&lt;/a&gt; is here, I will immediately award her the golden COTW).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny because it’s true. &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4616&amp;amp;cpage=1#comment-42215"&gt;Congrats, Detroitus&lt;/a&gt;! Until Dr. Arden registers for Skepchick and posts to claim the prize for herself, you win the best prize ever: the chance to party and drink Pangalactic Gargleblasters with A, as well as Dr. Kirsten Sanford, Yau-Man, Karen Stollznow, and bunches of other skeptics in San Francisco. Oh wait. &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arealgirl/3100787568/in/pool-skeptics/"&gt;I see you’ve already claimed your prize&lt;/a&gt;. Hope you enjoyed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of meet-ups, Boston Skeptics are getting together tomorrow morning at 10am at the Museum of Science! Meet us in the lobby, or if you can’t make it that early, meet us at Porter’s Bar and Grill afterward (2:30 or 3pm-ish) for drinks and a skeptical talk.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/Media/releases/ssc2008-22/ssc2008-22a.shtml"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/burgasser_bd.jpg" alt="Artist view of twin brown dawrfs, the faintest ever detected"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/~ajb/www/"&gt;Adam Burgasser&lt;/a&gt; (and old friend and colleague, married to an old friend too; hi &lt;a href="http://www.genevivebjorn.com/"&gt;Gen&lt;/a&gt;!) led a team at MIT that found the dim bulbs. They are brown dwarfs, objects with too much mass to be considered planets but too low mass to maintain hydrogen fusion in their cores like normal stars. Some people call them &amp;quot;failed stars&amp;quot;, but I don’t like that. Maybe they’re just overachieving planets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam’s team observed the brown dwarf 2MASS J09393548-2448279 (which they call 2M0939 for short), which lies about 17 light years away. They used Spitzer Space Telescope to get spectra of the star, which allowed them to get its temperature as well as its chemical composition. They found a temperature of about 600K (330 C or 620 F), making this the coolest brown dwarf ever discovered!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they had a mystery on their hands. They can measure how bright the brown dwarf is, and found that it was almost exactly twice as bright as its temperature indicates. What gives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was obvious enough: 2M0939 is actually a &lt;em&gt;binary&lt;/em&gt; star, &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; brown dwarfs in a tight orbit around each other. They are so close together they appear as one star. This means that each star has a luminosity — that is, total energy emitted from the surface — of only about one-millionth the luminosity of the Sun. So not only are they the coolest self-luminous objects ever seen, they are also the dimmest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They each have a mass of about 0.01-0.05 times that of the Sun, or about 10-50 times that of Jupiter. That means they are too low mass to have sustained fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores, so they aren’t proper stars. Most likely they were able to fuse deuterium when they were young and hotter, but that has long since shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the spectra Adam got makes me smile (the journal paper with the spectra &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/~ajb/www/papers/2008ApJ_689_L53.pdf"&gt;is posted as a PDF on Adam’s site&lt;/a&gt;). There are clear indications of ammonia, methane, and even water vapor (steam!) in the atmospheres of these two lightweight objects. The Sun, for example, is far too hot to have those molecules, and you usually see that sort of thing in planetary atmospheres! That’s why brown dwarfs are so weird. They have characteristics of both planets and stars. You have to be careful when studying them, because their borderline stance between these two classifications can be a little confusing. I studied brown dwarfs for a couple of years, and never got tired of how simply weird they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair making up 2M0939 (taken together) are the fifth closest brown dwarfs known, yet they are so dim you need a big telescope to see them at all. If you put them in place of the Sun in the solar system, from the Earth &lt;strong&gt;they would appear far dimmer than the full Moon in the sky!&lt;/strong&gt; And they would look, oddly enough, magenta to the eye because of their peculiar spectral properties; they don’t put out much light at all in the visible part of the spectrum. But you probably wouldn’t enjoy the view much, because at that distance from the 2M0939, we’d be frozen solid. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my congratulations to Adam and his team. Of course, records were meant to be broken… but then again, I’d put money on Adam being the one to break his own record. Because they are so dim, brown dwarfs like this are extremely tough to find, even though they may be among the most common objects in the Universe.  But our telescopes get better, and we have smart, dedicated people like Adam and his team out there looking. Who knows if we’ll find one even closer? Or, in this case, find two.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229105257959"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8317659032924518627.post-6024568639163609125">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9e454e490d942bf2</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">This Week's Citation Classic</title><published>2008-12-12T16:53:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T16:53:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/2008/12/this-weeks-citation-classic_12.html" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.com/" type="html">The general goal of science is to find general laws that explain patterns observed in nature.

Be there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other Dawkins news, he has posted an unused and unedited &lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,3410,Richard-Dawkins-interviews-Father-George-Coyne,Richard-Dawkins-RichardDawkinsnet"&gt;interview with Father George Coyne&lt;/a&gt; on his site. It&amp;#39;s long and it&amp;#39;s very aggravating, so not many of you will make it through the whole thing, but you&amp;#39;ll understand why it wasn&amp;#39;t used in any documentary. Coyne is personable, intelligent, and pleasant without fault. He&amp;#39;s the kind of avuncular and educated fellow anyone could find wonderful in conversation … except on religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawkins politely asks him how he reconciles the peculiar details of his religious belief to reason, and Coyne can&amp;#39;t quite address the problem. He&amp;#39;s willing to admit that if he&amp;#39;d been brought up in an Islamic household, he almost certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t be Catholic, but that that should inform him that the specifics of his belief are not founded in evidence and reason evades him totally. He falls back on &amp;quot;tradition&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;faith&amp;quot; as excuses. It&amp;#39;s tragic — I&amp;#39;m certain he&amp;#39;s a very smart man, but on religion he is simply blind and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tangent came to me while watching the video. I've been doing a lot of traveling lately, which means I spend all this time with strangers in airports. It's interesting; most people are just people, and you can't pigeonhole them into narrower roles without talking to them, except for people in uniforms. And who wears uniforms? Soldiers returning or going back to duty, police and security guards who are on duty, and &lt;i&gt;priests&lt;/i&gt;. The police I can understand; they have an official job to do, and the uniform is useful in announcing their authority and making them obvious people to turn to when you need help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But priests? Nope. That is an utterly useless profession. No one is worried about needing an emergency exorcism, or handling a drive-by spiritual crisis, or requiring rapid cracker delivery. Wearing the clerical collar is simply a demand for deference and respect, a token flaunted in expectation that the bearer will be regarded as especially virtuous and important. It's annoying and unwarranted. I'm afraid that when I see priests wandering about in the airport, I'm not thinking, "there goes a good man," I'm thinking, "there goes a sad gomer who wasted his life on the nonexistent." I suppose it's fair warning, but it's still pretentious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the Dawkins/Coyne interview, I'm noticing that Coyne has the magic collar on (I suppose if he'd been raised in an Islamic culture, he'd have a beard and black robes; if Buddhist, he'd be shaved bald and wearing orange; same difference), and Dawkins is dressed like any academic, nothing particularly distinctive. It bugged me. There is a status game being played here, and clerics demand it and get it, while scientists shrug off the superficialities and don't try to push it. If you just ignore the words they're saying (trust me, Coyne's words aren't at all enlightening) and look at the image, the message is that Coyne has special status, while Dawkins is simply one of the hoi polloi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't quite know what to do about it. We're certainly not going to propose a uniform for scientists, which would be just as pompous as priests making sure to announce their delusions visually even while they're standing around the luggage carousel. I guess I'm just going to have to put it on my to-do list of things to accomplish while we're destroying religion: diminish the credibility of the clerical uniform. We're just going to have to start regarding it in the same way we view clown costumes, I think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/mark_your_calendars_minnesotan.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/482848227" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229098586598"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4650">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9999756d07170ab6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Drinking Skeptically Columbus December</title><published>2008-12-12T16:00:06Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T16:00:06Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4650" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=7bda4e42383a577e6de747739e15649f&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio skeptics, come join me for the December edition of Drinking Skeptically in Columbus tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

I've had a few in the pipeline but I've felt compelled to do other stuff and every time I sit down to blog I either think "Nah, I'll do that later" or get distracted by some lameass important responsibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sorry for the "sorry post." I know these fuckers are tedious affairs, which is why this is slightly more. The full import is below the fold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's this idea that's been kicking around in my head for a while. It's a sort of registry, a quick reference list that would, I hope, be kind of like &lt;a href="http://rockstarramblings.blogspot.com/2006/05/doggerel-index-suggestions.html"&gt;Bronze Dog's Doggerel&lt;/a&gt;: a pithy but powerful prepackaged argument soundbyte that can quickly be linked when common nonsense is thrown around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I'm not the only one who has found the Doggerel list incredibly useful, and BD's a saint (so to speak) for putting the thing together. I can only hope that my idea ends up as useful as his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My idea, in its current state in my head, is called "The Requirements of Woo" or "Woo That Requires..." or something like that. That isn't what I'd call "pithy," so it obviously needs work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea is that I'd look at the underlying assumptions of various forms of woo-woo, flim-flam, and nonsense, and categorize by those that are scientifically untenable but necessary for the woo to exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That doesn't do the idea justice, so I'll toss out an example of what I mean. This is an alpha build demo of "Woo That Requires Dualism," in which I list the various forms of woo that require, if they are to be true, that dualism (mind/body or soul/body) is true, and so can be dismissed based on the science that neatly refutes dualism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Woo That Requires Dualism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The Afterlife&lt;br&gt;- Out-Of-Body Experiences&lt;br&gt;- Near-Death Experiences&lt;br&gt;- Ghosts&lt;br&gt;- Homunculus Models of Autism&lt;br&gt;- Etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Now, that's just quick and dirty. A full entry in the index would not just be a list; each woo that requires X, Y, or Z would have a brief summary of &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it requires X, Y, or Z, and each list would begin with a brief word on why X, Y, or Z is scientifically untenable in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the lists would all be living documents, subject to changes, revisions, and additions as people suggest them or I think of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously, some woo would show up on multiple lists. This is not a problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So some of the ideas I have so far are Dualism (obviously, though it might behoove me to separate "Cartesian Dualism" and "The Soul"), God, Metaphysics (that one might warrant a few different categories of metaphysical stuff, "Morality" and "Platonism," for example), "Energy," Vitalism...There are definitely more, and that's partly where the "Opinion Solicitation" part of the title comes in: what other categories of this type can you think of? What I'm looking for, specifically, is a scientifically untenable (or scientifically useless) claim that is necessary for a woo claim to be true. Also think of things that can be added to the lists I've already mentioned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And help me come up with a nice title, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other part of opinion solicitation is more literal: your opinion. If I put this together, do you think it would be useful? I really do. At the risk of sounding hubristic (that's a new one), I think something like this would be a great quick-reference resource. "Oh, that one again? Well, that requires such-and-such be true, and it's not. Check over here."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More to the point: would you use it? Even luminaries like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence"&gt;Orac&lt;/a&gt; link to Doggerel with regularity, and I'd like to hope that my little index could be used in a similar capacity. Or am I just crazy and full of myself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll probably do it no matter what, though. You know, just in case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I really do think it would be a way for me to (1)create something more useful to the skeptical community at large than my usual mix of snark, profanity, and...Well, more snark and profanity and (2)drive some traffic my way. Not that that's the necessary part of it, but it would be nice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what do you think?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</summary><author><name>noreply@blogger.com (Akusai)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss</id><title type="html">A Place For My Stuff</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://actionskeptics.blogspot.com/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229097275178"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3507">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c765585eacfaae74</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="architecture"/><category term="China"/><category term="food"/><category term="guest posts"/><category term="Nathan Myhrvold"/><category term="photography"/><title type="html">The Truth About Peking Duck and Other Beijing Reflections: A Guest Post</title><published>2008-12-12T18:53:32Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T18:53:32Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/cDx9ND0cHu0/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/the-truth-about-peking-duck-and-other-beijing-reflections-a-guest-post/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Earlier this week, Nathan Myhrvold gave us  his thoughts (and photos) from a visit to Shanghai.

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that scientists are actually looking for Dyson Spheres? It doesn’t even matter to me right now what they found. I just the love the fact that they’re taking this idea seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the idea?&lt;br&gt;
In 1960, physicist Freeman Dyson wrote a paper called “Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation”. It seemed likely to Dyson that a technically advanced civilization would have such a high energy metabolism, so to speak, that they might harvest as much energy from their parent star as possible by building solar collectors around a significant portion of it. He wrote that if this is correct, we could then perhaps find these societies by locating the infrared radiation that thermodynamics tells us would inevitably leak out of the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we’re talking about here is an alien-made shell of material with a diameter of millions of miles with a star at its center. Got that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/dyson1.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="343"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bizarre and science fictiony as this sounds, this is exactly what the researchers at the Fermilab Dyson Sphere Search Program are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using archived data from IRAS (The Infrared Astronomical Satellite), physicist Richard Carrigan and colleagues started with 10,000 infrared sources within 1000 light-years and were able to whittle that down to 17 candidates. Don’t get your hopes up though, all of these can be easily explained as clouds of hydrogen gas or dust surrounding old stars or even asteroids in our solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to infrared astronomer Charles Beichman of Caltech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many different kinds of astrophysical objects could masquerade as Dyson spheres,” “I think the search . . . is looking for a needle in a field of haystacks, when you’re not even sure there’s a needle there. But [Carrigan’s] done a very nice job of working through the available data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more promising is the data from the newer Spitzer Space Telescope that should be made available soon. This new all-sky infrared map will contain 100 million objects and have about 60 times the resolution as the IRAS data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it interesting that the17 spheres (as they’re called) are being added to SETIs list of interesting objects to investigate. Who knows, maybe someone using SETI@Home will soon find evidence of a Dyson Sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have a problem with the whole idea of Dyson spheres. I suppose one could argue that by the time a civilization has the technology for the mega-scale engineering that this would require…they would find an easier way to meet their energy demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words…If you can build a Dyson sphere, then you don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is true. There may be exotic sources of energy that a super-civilization could tap into obviating the need to go full-on Dyson-solar. It would have to be pretty sweet though to beat the energy output of a star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our sun for example puts out 3.86e33 ergs per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That translates to 386,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 watts per second. That’s 386 septillion watts or if you prefer, 386 yotta watts (I know someone is thinking…”a yotta is a lotta watts”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to build a Dyson Sphere or Shell all you would really need are a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Enormous energy demands. I guess that’s obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Enough raw material in your solar system…say a bunch of asteroids and perhaps a few rocky planets that you don’t care too much about. If you wanted one of the high-end super massive versions, you’d could also grab some of the usable atoms from some of your gas giants, if you have any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Self replicating nano-machines would come in handy. They could be programmed to reproduce until their numbers swell into the quintillions. Many hands make light work after all. They could then go about their business of dismantling all the objects in the solar system that have been flagged as expendable. Just make sure that the home planet is not on that list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bob Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229095953085"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/12/little-atoms-interview/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/62d72462b5bd0f25</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><title type="html">Little Atoms interview</title><published>2008-12-12T15:20:52Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T15:20:52Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/12/little-atoms-interview/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;a href="http://little-atoms.blogspot.com/2008/12/little-atoms-with-phil-plait.html"&gt;an interview with Neil Denny of the Little Atoms radio/podcast show&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, and it will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT today on Resonance 104.4 FM.

This reinforces the impression that neuroscience denial is the “new creationism” - the new battleground against &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=423"&gt;materialism&lt;/a&gt; as a basis for modern science. It is important to keep an eye on the arguments and tactics being developed by the DI to &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=79"&gt;deny the core claim of neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, that the mind is what the brain does. This is likely to be an increasing area of attention for the DI and others with an anti-scientific agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Dishonesty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creationists are intellectually dishonest because they are not engaged in a genuine search for understanding, but rather have staked out an ideological position that they will defend at all costs. This applies as well to Dr. Egnor, who is ideologically dedicated to denying the obvious conclusion from the last century of neuroscience - that the brain causes mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Dr. Egnor repeats points that I have already countered, without addressing my counter points. We are undeniably engaged in a blog discourse - he responds specifically to my blog posts and I reply to his. There is no excuse for not responding to major points that I make against his position. In honest discourse, when one’s point is countered there are three valid responses: acknowledge the counter as valid and revise your position; show that the counter is not valid; or show that the conflict cannot be resolved with currently available information (agree to disagree). The intellectually dishonest or sloppy thing to do is to repeat your original claim without even acknowledging that it has been countered. Creationists have been doing this for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have to point out his reference to “his pet theory” when referring to modern materialist neuroscience. This is the same rhetorical tactic as referring to evolutionary theory as “Darwinism” but with extra added absurdity. Neuroscience is no ones “pet theory,” and I certainly do not own it. I do not even claim any originality to the positions I am defending against his denialist attack. I am simply stating my synthesis of the current findings and theories of neuroscience. If I choose to defend plate tectonics from pseudoscientific nonsense, that does not make it “my pet theory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brain-Mind Hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/12/we_can_relax_dr_novella_declar.html"&gt;most recent post&lt;/a&gt; Egnor writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent past, the Yale neurologist has been so confident of the truth of his materialistic ideology on the mind-brain problem that he has asserted that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;    “The materialist hypothesis- that the brain causes consciousness- has made a number of predictions, and every single prediction has been validated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the hubris (has any reputable scientist ever claimed that ‘every single prediction’ of his pet theory has been validated?), one of Dr. Novella’s implicit predictions seems to have frustratingly failed to materialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor is borrowing a tactic of the creationists - deliberately misinterpret scientific confidence as hubris and arrogance. This is a cheap shot, but one that is easy to make to a lay audience.  Egnor ignores the fact that I have already countered this claim of his (actually more than once), but I will do it again. He ignores the fact that I spelled out exactly what I meant by “every single prediction” - by actually listing every single prediction and showing that they have in fact been validated. Here they are again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the brain causes mind, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- Brain states will correlate to mental and behavioral states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- Brain maturity will correlate with mental and emotional maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3- Changing the brain’s function (with drugs, electrical or magnetic stimulation, or other methods) will change mental function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4- Damaging the brain with damage the mind - producing specific deficits that correlate to the area of the brain damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5- There will be no documentable mental phenomena in the absence of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6- When the brain dies, mental function ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my position that all of these specific predictions have been validated over the last century of neuroscience research. It is a cheap debating trick to dismiss my position as “hubris” rather than simply address my points. In fact I would add another prediction to the list, one that I have discussed but have not previously added explicity to the list - if brain causes mind then brain activity and changes will precede the corresponding mental activity and changes. Causes come before their effects. This too &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=273"&gt;has been validated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor has made several attempts to counter this position, and I have already pointed out that they are all invalid. Egnor has failed to address any of my counterpoints, however. His points are essentially that: 1- correlation is not causation; 2- the brain-mind correlation is not perfect because the brain only mostly causes the mind; 3- materialism has not solved the “hard problem” of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dualism of the Gaps &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is easy to deal with - as I have stated, the correlation of brain to mind holds up to within the resolution that we are currently able to measure brain states.  Egnor can only point to the fact that when we try to correlate EEG’s (electroencephalogram), for example, to conscious states the fit is not perfect. He has so far ignored my counter that EEG’s are a very low resolution way to look at brain function. As our instruments improve the correlation continues to hold up within the higher resolution. But we are still a long way away from mapping the brain at the resolution of its actual function - the level of neuronal connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we have not yet mapped all brain connections -we do not yet fully understand brain function as a system. So we cannot yet fully explain all brain behavior. In essence Egnor makes a “dualism of the gaps” argument, but fails to show positive evidence for a lack of correlation between brain and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correlation and Causation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding correlation he most recently writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one doubts that there are quantifiable law-like correlates between behavioral states and brain states, and between some brain states and other brain states. But behavior and brain states are objective third person phenomena, the sort science deals with routinely. And behavior is not the same thing as the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he is saying is that neuroscience can correlate everything it can measure (behavior) to brain function and brain states, but that neuroscience cannot measure subjective experience, therefore it cannot explain it. This is the old creationist tactic of denying the legitimacy of scientific inference. We cannot measure subjective experience, but we can infer it to a reliable enough degree to do science. For example, one of those behaviors that Egnor is referring to is the reporting of subjective states. We cannot measure how much pain a person is feeling, but they can report how much pain they are feeling, and we can make reasonable inferences from those reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is just one of countless potential examples. Neuroscientists have recently been mapping those parts of the brain that are responsible for the subjective experience that we occupy our bodies - that our “self” is located in the same space as our physical body. We take this for granted, but it is actually a function of the brain, and it can be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible to reliably induce an out of body experience (OBE) by electrically stimulating the left temporal parietal junction (TPJ). (&lt;a href="http://www.mindmodulations.com/mindmods/images/PDF/(%20in%20press)blanke%20o,%20thut%20g.%20inducing%20out%20of%20body%20experiences.%20in%20%20tall%20tales%20(ed.%20g.%20della%20sala),%20oxford%20%20oxford%20university%20press.%20pdf.pdf"&gt;Here is a good recent summary&lt;/a&gt; of the research.)  The TPJ seems to be involved with bringing together visual, vestibular (sensing gravity and acceleration), and proprioceptive (feeling where one’s limbs are in 3-dimensional space) information to create the sense that we are inside our bodies. It has been shown that having a seizure in the TPJ correlates with an OBE, that stimulating the TPJ can cause an OBE, that imagining onself as floating above the body (in a typical OBE position) correlated with activity in the TPJ, and that inhibiting the function of the TPJ with transcranial magnetic stimulation can &lt;a href="http://www.mindmodulations.com/mindmods/images/PDF/(%20in%20press)blanke%20o,%20thut%20g.%20inducing%20out%20of%20body%20experiences.%20in%20%20tall%20tales%20(ed.%20g.%20della%20sala),%20oxford%20%20oxford%20university%20press.%20pdf.pdf"&gt;block this effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor would have you believe that this growing body of scientific evidence only shows that brain states correlate with the behavior of subjects reporting their experience, and not with the experiences themselves. He would have you believe that even if turning on and off a light switch reliably precedes and correlates with a light turning on and off, the switch does not actually control the light - not even that, he would have you believe that the scientific inference that the switch controls the light (absent any other plausible hypothesis) is materialist pseudoscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To beat this dead horse a bit - neuroscientists can stimulate the motor cortex (electrically or magnetically) and this will cause the appropriate muscle to contract on the opposite side of the body.  If I stimulate the motor cortex that corresponds to the left hand, then the left hand will twitch. Does anyone deny that this bit of brain matter controls the muscles of the hand? If I then destroy that bit of gray matter, the left hand becomes paralyzed. Now - If I do the exact same thing to a part of the brain that controls a specific subjective experience or aspect of personality, such as an emotion or the subjective sense that one is inside the physical body, the resulting correlation is the same. There is no basis to conclude that the motor cortex controls movement but that other parts of the brain do not control subjective experience, unless one denies modern neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hard Problem of Consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Egnor has been hitting this theme quite frequently, and yet has not seemed to notice that I have already demolished it. His premise is that neuroscience cannot explain how the brain causes subjective experience, therefore we should conclude that it does not cause (or entirely cause) subjective experience. His premise is dubious and his logic fallacious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the premise, I will grant that this is a legitimate point of controversy. In my opinion, Daniel Dennett is correct in that it is adequate to say that subjective experience is an emergent property of brain function. We do not need an explanation beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if I grant to Dr. Egnor that this is controversial (meaning I am not depending upon the emergent property explanation as a premise), his argument is logically not valid. And again, I have already pointed this out and Egnor has failed to respond to my counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Dr. Egnor &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/12/consciousness_and_intelligent.html#more"&gt;did take notice&lt;/a&gt; when the philosopher &lt;a href="http://fragments.consc.net/djc/2008/10/the-problem-of-consciousness-meets-intelligent-design.html"&gt;David Chalmers pointed out&lt;/a&gt; his fallacy, although he still doesnt get it. Egnor’s fallacy is this - the ability to explain how A causes B is independent of evidence for the fact that A does cause B. In other words, we can (and do) know with a high degree of scientific confidence that the brain causes mind, even if we cannot explain exactly how the brain causes mind. The lines of evidence I outlined above all establish quite clearly that brain causes mind. Alternate hypotheses, such as the brain as receiver of the mind, do not fit the data, or add completely unecessary phenomena. (It’s possible there is a little invisible elf who turns the light on and off every time I flip the switch, but I don’t think I need to hypothesize one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egnor could not ignore Chalmers because he has cited him so many times as such a wonderful philosophy (I’m not saying he isn’t) because Egnor falsely believed that Chalmers supported Egnor’s Cartesian dualism. I pointed out that Chalmers, in fact, specifically rejects Cartesian dualism (that the mind is made of stuff other than matter) as ridiculous. Chalmers, rather, thinks that there is a higher order physical process at work that cannot be reduced to brain function (and as I said, Dennett disagrees). Chalmers now writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to see this is to note that the “hard problem” does nothing to suggest that consciousness doesn’t lawfully &lt;em&gt;depend&lt;/em&gt; on physical processes, at least in the sense that certain physical states are reliably associated with certain states of consciousness in our world.  Even if materialism is rejected, there is still good reason to believe that there is such a dependence, via laws of nature that connect physical processes and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalmers felt it necessary to specifically state that his philosophical position cannot be used to support intelligent design.  Egnor tried to repond to this, but he merely restated his position and did not seem to understand his fallacy, and therefore could not put forward an effective rebuttal. Chalmers states that consciousness is dependent upon natural physical processes, meaning brain function (even if we do not understand how), he just doesn’t think that these physical processes reduce to brain function, while I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, Chalmers is recognizing that we can establish that the brain causes mind even if we do not understand how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Egnor’s writing about subjectivity and intention, therefore, is off point. It is irrelevant (a non sequitur) because it does not address the evidence by which we can confidently state that the brain causes mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Egnor’s three pillars of neuroscience denial - dualism of the gaps;  denying the inferences from brain-mind correlation; and confusing the question of &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the brain causes mind with the question of &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; the brain cause mind - have all been shattered. He has not acknowledged, let alone countered, these points against his position. He simply restates them over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear why he is blogging for the Discovery Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/beavers-gone-bad/" rel="external "&gt;very interesting article&lt;/a&gt; over at Uncommon Descent about beavers, and the things that they do. I’m not entirely sure why they posted the article - Barry seems to be trying to make the point that because Beavers clearly can commit criminal acts but just as clearly can’t form criminal intent, their brains are different from humans, and there’s therefore something “non-materialist” and special about the human brain. I’d like to take a look at the same story, but with a slightly different focus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here’s &lt;a href="http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=10009" rel="external "&gt;the story&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Green campaigners called in police after discovering an illegal logging site in a nature reserve - and rounded up a gang of beavers.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Environmentalists found 20 neatly stacked tree trunks and others marked for felling with notches at the beauty-spot at Subkowy in northern Poland.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;But police followed a trail left where one tree had been dragged away - and found a beaver dam right in the middle of the river.   A police spokesman said: “The campaigners are feeling pretty stupid. There’s nothing more natural than a beaver.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Let’s look at this story from the perspective of detecting design. That’s a topic that’s particularly relevant right now, given that Dembski himself has &lt;a href="http://austringer.net/wp/index.php/2008/12/04/vindication/" rel="external "&gt;recently abandoned&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com/intelligent-design/reinstating-the-explanatory-filter/" rel="external "&gt;abandoned his abandonment of&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanatory_filter" rel="external "&gt;explanatory filter&lt;/a&gt;.

The principal, &lt;a title="Franklin Co. student claims work was censored - Roanoke.com" href="http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/187410"&gt;Kevin Bezy, rejected it and has held up publication of the magazine until it is revised&lt;/a&gt;. Bezy explains himself, and it's the usual kind of weasely nonsense that makes me very snarly in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked his opinion of evolution and how that may have factored into the situation, Bezy declined to discuss his feelings on the theory. He said he considers that irrelevant to the matter, believing it important to remain unbiased when making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't give a good greasy squirt of slimy spit for Mr Bezy's "feelings" about evolution. He is supposed to be a professional educator, and the unbiased status of the theory is that it is the only legitimate explanation for life's diversity; no other explanation, including the page and a half of poetic metaphor and myth included in the book of Genesis, is even close. When censoring well-supported scientific ideas, hiding behind a false objectivity is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The law gives the principal the responsibility to edit publications of the school," Bezy said. "It is an important responsibility because the principal has to look out for the rights and sensitivities of all students, especially in a diverse and multicultural area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, this guy sounds like a pompous gasbag. All this talk about sensitivities and multiculturalism isn't being used to promote a diversity of ideas: he's using it to squelch the expression of any opinions that differ from the flavorless, mealy pablum to which he wants the cultural environment of the school reduced. A "diverse and multicultural area" should be one where there is an outspoken clash of ideas, not one where disagreement is silenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing, he said of the piece: "It didn't present the theory with a sensitivity for those who hold other theories. The teacher of the student was asked to take out language that stated his theory is the only theory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other theories? Like what? Name some, Mr Bezy. Show us the courage of your convictions that these other ideas are worth abusing science for. Does it include young earth creationism, the claim that the universe didn't exist prior to the time a few Hebrew patriarchs started scribbling down notes about how to control their tribes? Or perhaps you are thinking of Intelligent Design creationism, a fatuous pretense to scientific thinking that has no evidence, no research program, and no rationale other than that they want to put a false front over some silly old myths?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, evolution &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the only theory deserving of the name … unless Bezy is confusing the scientific meaning of the word &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; with the colloquial, and thinks it is equivalent to &amp;quot;brain fart&amp;quot;. It is not the business of a public school to inundate students with a variety of brain farts — they get enough of those in church on Sunday — but to provide a disciplined introduction to the &lt;i&gt;best&lt;/i&gt; scholarly ideas. Which of those two alternatives is the mission of &lt;a href="http://gereau.frco.k12.va.us/"&gt;the Gereau Center&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/sometimes_i_think_public_schoo.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/482738521" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229091718224"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/complementary_and_alternative_medicine_c.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9db88fd4dc59669c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">"Complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM) goes for the bandwagon fallacy again</title><published>2008-12-12T13:30:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T13:30:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~3/482705953/complementary_and_alternative_medicine_c.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/complementary_and_alternative_medicine_c.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"&gt;&lt;img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right around the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/as_long_as_a_presidential_term_in_office.php"&gt;time of my blogiversary yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, when I had intended nothing more than a brief by characteristically self-indulgent bit of navel-gazing twaddle (at which, I succeeded brilliantly, I might add; no one--and I mean &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt;--does self-indulgent navel-gazing twaddle better than I do), what should be there tempting me from my intended day off? Lots of news stories about a report published by the Centers for Disease Control about a yearly survey regarding the usage of so-called complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in the U.S. Predictably, headlines in major news outlets proclaimed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/12/10/alternative-therapies-have-gone-mainstream/"&gt;Alternative Therapies Have Gone Mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. (This particular article has a truly disturbing picture of a child undergoing a chiropractic manipulation; personally, I consider that borderline child abuse.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/10/AR2008121001601.html"&gt;38% of Adults Use Alternative Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE4B95XO20081210"&gt;Many Americans turning to unconventional medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, from theose headlines and stories, you might think that CAM usage is skyrocketing right here in the ol' U. S. of A. You might think that the the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/nhsr12.pdf"&gt;2007 National Health Statistics report on CAM use by Americans&lt;/a&gt; had found some massive sea change in American's usage of unscientific medical modalities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'd think wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/complementary_and_alternative_medicine_c.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/complementary_and_alternative_medicine_c.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/482705953" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229090519174"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=906">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e6a9814020c40d21</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Variation"/><title type="html">Will vs. going to: a recount</title><published>2008-12-12T13:54:29Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T13:54:29Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=906" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I took a quick poll of a few small English-language texts, to see how often future-time meanings were expressed in various tensed-verb forms ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=901"&gt;Alternative futures&lt;/a&gt;", 12/11/2008). My conclusion was that by far the commonest method in written American English is to use  forms of the modal auxiliary &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;; but that in spoken American English, other alternatives are closer to even with it. However, my sample was too small to draw any very reliable quantitative conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this morning, I'm doing another Breakfast Experiment™ to try to get better numbers, at least for some of the alternatives in the spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data comes from the transcripts of two published conversational speech corpora, "&lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2004T19"&gt;Fisher English Training Speech Part 1 Transcripts&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2005T19"&gt;Fisher English Training Speech Part 2 Transcripts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, together comprising 11,699 conversations of up to ten minutes each, recorded in 2003. The speakers come from a broad sample of regions, ages, and socioeconomic levels — full demographic details are available in the associated publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don't have time during breakfast to read all these conversations and look for future-time references in tensed verbs, I'm going to come at the question from a different angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I'll scan the transcripts for instances of the strings "will", "won't", "'ll", "going to", and "gonna", taking appropriate precautions to avoid cases where these strings form part of other words (e.g. "willing" or "Williamsburg").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I'll check a sample of the hits in order to estimate what percentage are genuine modals or semi-modals, as opposed to things like "I believe in absolute free will" or "I hate going to the doctor". (In the case of "won't", I'll also exclude things like "they won't let you smoke anywhere" and "I won't watch that stuff".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I'll use those estimated proportions to get corrected counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;will&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'ll&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;won't&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;going to&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;gonna&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;15,219&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;32,515&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4,975&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;29,331&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;22,176&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This yields 15219+32515+4975 = 52,709 for the various forms of &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;, versus 29331+22176 = 51,507 for the various forms of &lt;em&gt;going to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked a random sample of 100 instances of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and found that 3 were things like "then it's their own free will to read it".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking a random sample of 100 instances of &lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt;, I found that 13 were things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;all the money's going to transportation and food&lt;br&gt;
instead of going to the drive through&lt;br&gt;
i'm going to a ear nose and throat specialist&lt;br&gt;
i'd be interested in going to see it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And checking a random sample of 100 instances of &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt;, I found that 24 were things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;they won't really let you stop even for a minute&lt;br&gt;
my husband won't fly&lt;br&gt;
my body won't take it no more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is a bit unfair, since I didn&amp;#39;t try to exclude modal but non-future instances of the other word-types, but still…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't try to exclude non-standard stuff like "and she died and oh i know you won't gonna believe this i had her stuffed".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, "'ll" and "gonna" in the transcripts are essentially always the modal auxiliary or the semi-modal, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, adding everything up with the estimated adjustment factors, we get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.97*15219 + 0.76*4975 + 32515 = 51,058&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for forms of "will", and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.87*29331 + 22176 = 47,694&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for forms of "going to". Or retaining a more reasonable number of significant digits, about 51 to 48 in favor of "will".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I haven't tried to calculate how many of these, in any of the lists, are actually references to future time.  Some of them are (for example) predications of generic propensity like these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;only once in a while will i watch the show with my parents &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;seven six and he plays like six one you know what i mean you go through him shaq will go through you and through somebody else &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;being a nurse i'm gonna listen to the health more than i wanna listen to say uh financial news &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are "past future" uses of &lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt; like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;i was gonna say what's it like now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;i heard originally when they were gonna make that they wanted to do all three&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course we've completely ignored all the other ways, standard and non-standard, that English has for expressing future time reference in tensed clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I think it's fair to conclude that in contemporary American speech, forms of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and forms of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; fulfill this function about equally often, with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;perhaps slightly in the lead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229087517073"><id gr:original-id="http://leftbrainrightbrain.co.uk/?p=1720">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/048c42c8d5028854</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Well Harold, since you asked…</title><published>2008-12-12T10:28:51Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T10:28:51Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LeftBrain/rightBrain/~3/482551221/" type="text/html"/><author><name>Kev</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229085096890"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_1.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f1a36e968ca0354</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medical Education"/><title type="html">Choosing a medical specialty III - applying, interviewing and matching</title><published>2008-12-12T11:26:27Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T11:26:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/482625024/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_1.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/choosing_a_medical_specialty_i_1.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Aside from taking 4th year medical school classes it's also the time of year that medical students who plan to graduate in 2009 (like me) are applying to residency programs across the country.  This is an interesting process and one that many people outside of medicine are unfamiliar with, and quite surprised by.  For one, did you know that we don't have final say on where we train in residency but that the decision is made by a computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's true.  The process is called "the Match" and it's a time of great excitement and anxiety for 4th year medical students.  For one, there are far more applicants than there are residency positions around the country - largely due to application from foreign applicants.  Also, depending on which field you're applying, there may be many more applicants for each given position than there are positions.  So let's look at some of the match data from the &lt;a href="http://www.nrmp.org/"&gt;National Residency Match Program&lt;/a&gt; that they publish each year (&lt;a href="http://www.nrmp.org/data/chartingoutcomes2007.pdf"&gt;Charting Outcomes in the Match 2008 - PDF&lt;/a&gt;)  to give you an idea of what a 4th year medical student is facing.  Table 1 of the report is enough to give many students palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divided by US vs other applicants, this is what your chances are as a 4th year senior for getting into the various medical specialties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now that &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/choosing_a_medical_specialty.php"&gt;you've chosen your medical specialty&lt;/a&gt; what kinds of things can you do to make your chances of matching better?  And what's it like applying for these programs even though you can't outright pick them, and conversely, they can't directly pick you?  How does this crazy system work?

A charming example, I thought, of the tradition of extremely vague weather-forecast language in the blustery British Isles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember being astonished at the (implausible) scientific precision of the language of American weather forecasts when I moved to California: &amp;quot;a low of 61 and a high of 69″, they would say, before giving the exact probability of rainfall (&amp;quot;70% likelihood of precipitation&amp;quot;), and perhaps adding a parts-per-billion pollution index.  In Britain it&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;scattered showers and bright intervals&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cloudy with rain in parts, but a bit nicer later on&amp;quot;. Saying &amp;quot;pretty miserable by and large&amp;quot; for the entire country is only very slightly less precise than some of the more official weather forecasts by actual weathercasters.  It&amp;#39;s a difficult task, predicting what will happen to wet and gusty streams of air over the variegated terrain of some small islands at the edge of the North Atlantic, directly exposed to the Arctic in the north and the notoriously stormy Bay of Biscay in the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those many idealistic souls who imagine that we would do better with a language that was free of vagueness and ambiguity, its terms tightly defined so that the meaning of what we said would always be sharp and clear, forget about tasks like trying to summarize British weather in a few seconds before the news headlines.  In that context you're glad of vague hand-waving idioms of generality like &lt;i&gt;by and large&lt;/i&gt;, and hedging adverbs like &lt;i&gt;pretty&lt;/i&gt;, and sweeping emotion-laden adjectives ranging from human psychology to impressionistic meteorology, like &lt;i&gt;miserable&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather as I write (it's after 9 a.m. now, so already the sky is light here in Scotland) is cool and damp.  There is a hint of sunshine from behind the thin cloud cover.  Edinburgh castle will look extraordinary as always, a brooding grey mass of damp stone a thousand years old overlooking the Princes Street gardens, with hints of sun catching it from some low angle.  It's extraordinarily beautiful.  Yes, there will be rain and wind some time today, and freezing temperatures in some parts of the country.  But it's easier to enjoy than it is to summarize.  Humphrys was just enacting the usual British linguistic ritual of weather-grumbling.  The weather isn't literally misery-inducing.  I take a certain delight in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edinburgh, at least, is never truly frigid like Minnesota at this time of year (I've never even seen a patch of ice here, or snow lasting till after breakfast time, and this is my second winter in residence); and crucially, it's never hot and humid in the summer.

&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technique is proving so successful that the Air Force will begin teaching &amp;quot;battlefield acupuncture&amp;quot; early next year to physicians deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan, senior officials will announce tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[…]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using tiny needles that barely penetrate the skin of a patient&amp;#39;s ear, Air Force doctors here say they can interrupt pain signals going to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their experience over several years indicates the technique developed by Col. Richard Niemtzow, an Air Force physician, can relieve even unbearable pain for days at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 



&lt;p&gt;And I thought this cartoon was a joke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105365dc304970c-pi"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/improbable.html"&gt;&lt;img alt="Alternative-ambulance" border="0" src="http://skeptico.blogs.com/.a/6a00d83451df0c69e20105365dc41c970c-800wi" title="Alternative-ambulance"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was. But it’s not anymore.  This military doctor is apparently claiming he can interrupt pain signals going to the brain for days at a time.  And he is relying on &amp;quot;experience over several years&amp;quot; - presumably because actual studies suggest that acupuncture is nothing more than a highly elaborate placebo. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orac, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/04/sham_acupuncture_is_better_than_true_acu.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/yet_another_acupuncture_metaanalysis_gar.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/09/yawnanother_acupuncture_study.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steven Novella &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=362"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=368"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=103"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php?p=14"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=371"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harriet Hall &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=252"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=44"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our troops deserve better.  For example, only treatments that have been shown to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Note: cartoon from &lt;a href="http://www.dcscience.net/improbable.html"&gt;DC&amp;#39;s IMPROBABLE SCIENCE page&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dec 15 - Edited to add:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two more blog posts today from Orac and Novella:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taysia Glover, who is currently studying Architectural Engineering at the greatest university on the planet (the University of Texas at Austin), is getting the ball rolling on a skeptic’s group based in Austin, and she wants to get the word out to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the the thing: Austin is where the Legion of Doom (a.k.a. the Texas State Board of Education) meets to carry out its evil deeds, and having another organized group of rational thinkers in the area might help in efforts to keep that in check. Plus, Austin is one of the coolest cities in North America, and would be a great place for all manner of skeptical meetings and conferences, and a good local group is always beneficial for planning those types of things. So even if you’re not from Austin, show Taysia some love, and do what you can to help her and the Austin skeptics get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can contact Taysia at: &lt;a href="mailto:misstaysia@mail.utexas.edu"&gt;misstaysia@mail.utexas.edu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Sam Ogden</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229056354763"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=903">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a2ce85d57f991b50</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Announcements"/><category term="Fieldwork"/><category term="Gift ideas"/><title type="html">Give the gift of The Linguists</title><published>2008-12-12T04:12:25Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T04:12:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=903" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.thelinguists.com/dvd/images/dvd-package.jpg" width="100" height="150" align="right"&gt; Just in time for the holiday season: &lt;a href="http://www.thelinguists.com/dvd/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Linguists&lt;/i&gt; educational DVD&lt;/a&gt;!

&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, reasonably robust identification of the language being spoken is more like what the &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/index.html"&gt;state of the art&lt;/a&gt; for this sort of technology can now aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, here are some recent results for eight systems tested on a two-way choice between  Caribbean and non-Caribbean Spanish based on a three-second sample. The different bars represent performance for the different systems, with the performance of a human judge included for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/results/all.prim.closed.sdr.03.cavg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/results/all.prim.closed.sdr.03.cavg.jpg" width="475" title="Click for a larger version"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the performance of two systems on an open set, where the task was to detect Caribbean Spanish in a set of samples that included not only other sorts of Spanish, but also Arabic, Bengali, Farsi, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Tamil, Thai, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Mandarin (mainland and Taiwanese), Min, Wu, English (American and Indian), Hindi, Urdu, and five other languages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/results/all.prim.open.sdr.03.cavg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/results/all.prim.open.sdr.03.cavg.jpg" width="475" title="Click for a larger version"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both graphs, the red portion of the bars indicates the proportion of misses (where the test segment was Caribbean Spanish but the system failed to detect it), and the blue portion of the graphs indicates the proportion of false alarms (where the system claimed to detect Caribbean Spanish, but the test segment was some other dialect of Spanish, in the closed-set trial, or some language altogether, in the open-set trial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the performance for a closed-set language-detection task, for a larger number of participating systems, averaged over the 14 languages in the set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/results/all.prim.closed.glr.30.cavg.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/results/all.prim.closed.glr.30.cavg.jpg" width="475" title="Click for a larger version"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the best of the systems are doing pretty well at recognizing languages, but not so well at distinguishing one dialect from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like more details, the full evaluation plan for this test (known as LRE07) is &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/LRE07EvalPlan-v8b.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the results are &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/lre/2007/lre07_eval_results_vFINAL/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The evaluations were conducted by the &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/"&gt;Multimodal Information Group&lt;/a&gt; at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the data for the LRE evaluations was collected and distributed by the &lt;a href="http://ldc.upenn.edu/"&gt;Linguistic Data Consortium&lt;/a&gt; (where Language Log is now hosted).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229052630475"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/it_just_gets_better_and_better.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/87b9de994176456d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Religion"/><title type="html">It just gets better and better</title><published>2008-12-12T02:26:10Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T02:26:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/482265284/it_just_gets_better_and_better.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/it_just_gets_better_and_better.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The skirmish over Christmas in Washington state just gets funnier every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now someone wants to &lt;a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/35616504.html"&gt;put up a Festivus pole in the capitol&lt;/a&gt;. That's hilarious enough, but it gets better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Westboro Baptist Church has demanded to be allowed to put up a sign that says, &lt;a href="http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/thebigblog/archives/156716.asp"&gt;"Santa Claus will take you to Hell"&lt;/a&gt;. I never thought I'd laugh at Fred Phelps and his gang of hateful loonies, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We aren't done yet! &lt;a href="http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1528"&gt;Bill Donohue of the Catholic League has to butt in and bray&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gov. Gregoire is responsible for this mess. Having first acceded to the requests of atheists to attack Christmas, she is now confronted with the likes of the Westboro Baptist Church, a viciously anti-American, anti-Catholic and anti-gay group. There is a way to deal with this situation in a manner that is legally acceptable and morally defensible, but neither the Washington governor, nor her lawyers, have figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, I know! How about keeping the government entirely secular, throwing all the Christmas kitsch out of the capitol, and admitting that government has no business promoting &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; religious beliefs at all? That would be my solution. I think it's clear by now that in a country with a crazy plurality of religious ideas, each one demanding equal recognition, the only fair decision is &lt;i&gt;no recognition at all&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Bully Donohue &lt;i&gt;can't&lt;/i&gt; figure that out. His solution is some pointless shuffling of signage around to keep the atheists separate from the nativity scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/it_just_gets_better_and_better.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/482265284" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229051100459"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/11/griffinobama-follow-up/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/08b4a942d1dfe0f1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">Griffin/Obama follow up</title><published>2008-12-12T02:21:44Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T02:21:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/11/griffinobama-follow-up/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine who shall remain nameless sent me an interesting follow-up to &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/11/nasas-griffin-butting-heads-with-obama/"&gt;the news that Griffin may be giving the Obama transition team for NASA a hard time&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of blogs and news orgs wrote about the situation, so Griffin posted a note to a NASA mailing list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point of Contact: David Mould, Office of Public Affairs, 202-358-1898&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;————————————————-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A MESSAGE FROM THE NASA ADMINISTRATOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent report in the Orlando Sentinel suggested that NASA is not cooperating with members of President-elect Obama’s transition team currently working at Headquarters. This report, largely supported by anonymous sources and hearsay, is simply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to reiterate what I have stated in a previous email to all NASA Officials: we must make every effort to “lean forward,” to answer questions promptly, openly and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are fully cooperating with transition team members. Since mid-November, the agency has provided 414 documents and 185 responses to 191 requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are six outstanding responses, and the agency will meet the deadline for those queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we strongly urge full and free cooperation by companies performing work for NASA. I am appalled by any accusations of intimidation, and encourage a free and open exchange of information with the contractor community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition team’s work is too important to become mired in unsupported and anonymous allegations. The President-elect’s transition team deserves everyone’s complete cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael D. Griffin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administrator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I’m not thrilled with using &amp;quot;unnamed sources&amp;quot; in articles, but on the other hand Griffin’s statement doesn’t really clear things up; if the accusations are false then nothing has changed, and if they are true than he would be forced to post something like this anyway. It’s an irritating aspect of he-said-she-said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also like I said in the earlier post, read the original Sentinel article with skepticism, but it doesn’t take away the point I was making. Griffin will almost certainly be replaced, and that I hope Obama picks up the ball and puts someone in his stead who has experience and vision for NASA. While I disagree with Griffin politically and on some other issues, he in general has the right idea for NASA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229043190762"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7739267758056601489">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6f022e9c6231a49c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="My World" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Noah's Ark</title><published>2008-12-12T00:35:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-12T00:43:19Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/noahs-ark.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7739267758056601489/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7739267758056601489" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Yesterday I dropped a hint about a plastic model of Noah&amp;#39;s Ark.

I was about to give him congrats over there, but I figured this deserved a post of its own.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started blogging seriously in May of 07.  I had been attracted to the crankosphere via the cesspit of inanity that is Conservapedia.  A small cabal of folks set up a parallel site called &lt;a href="http://rationalwiki.com"&gt;rationalwiki &lt;/a&gt;to refute the hate-filled lies at the other site.  I ended up writing a number of medical pieces over there, and eventually decided I needed to write pieces less consistent with what a wiki requires, so I started up &lt;a href="http://whitecoatunderground.com"&gt;WhiteCoat Underground&lt;/a&gt; at wordpress.  Originally, I was going to write a lot more medical anecdotes, but I was seduced by the need to refute ridiculous medical claims, and finally stumbled on the term &lt;a href="http://whitecoatunderground.com/?page_id=252"&gt;"woo"&lt;/a&gt;.  Trying to hunt down this term, I came upon &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence"&gt;Respectful Insolence&lt;/a&gt; (and from there, the rest of scienceblogs.com).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote prolifically, if not always well, and found ideas here at Sb to riff on.  After sharing some cross-traffic from Orac, I emailed him for blog advice, and was surprised to receive a prompt and helpful response.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chandra’s X-Ray view of the Tarantula Nebula. Credit: NASA/CXC/Penn State/L.Townsley, et al.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a giant, vast, meganormous cloud of gas furiously churning out stars. It’s too huge to comprehend; it’s &lt;em&gt;800 light years across&lt;/em&gt;. For comparison, the nearby Orion Nebula is maybe 50 light years across, tops. So we’re talking monster gas cloud here. Happily, it’s 165,000 or so light years away in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a companion galaxy to the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it gets scarier. When any star-forming cloud gets going, lots of massive stars get made. They live short lives then explode in titanic events called supernovae. The Tarantula has three huge bubbles inside it, cavities plowed up by exploding stars. Near the center of the cloud they have intersected, and there sits the cluster R136, another giant in its class. It has at least 200 massive stars, and who knows how many smaller ones, drowned out in the glare of their luminous brethren. A lot of the stars in R136 are gonna blow someday soon, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found yourself suddenly transported to the Tarantula, you’d be fried, battered, irradiated, vaporized, suffocated (of course: it’s still a pretty hard vacuum by Earth standards), and probably just pretty damn unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those stars in R136 are flooding the gas cloud with X-rays, but it’s probably the long-dead supernovae that are lighting up the gas as seen in &lt;a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2008/30dor/"&gt;this Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the Tarantula&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the deepest X-ray image ever taken of the cloud, totaling 31 hours of exposure time. Scientists will plumb that data, looking for insight into how these massive stars formed, how the older ones died, and just what’s going on in this mind-numbingly violent region of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder when the next star to detonate will let go in that cloud. When it does, it’ll be a cornucopia of science for astronomers. The cluster and cloud are too far away to hurt us, but the light show should be pretty cool to watch unfold.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229026630630"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3501">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/710dd85d38bdfa52</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="cars"/><category term="Daniel hamermesh"/><category term="financial crisis"/><title type="html">What's the Point of Bailing Out the Auto Industry?</title><published>2008-12-11T20:26:26Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T20:26:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/Jzm4BcUGm68/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/whats-the-point-of-bailing-out-the-auto-industry/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Governments intervene in markets all the time - and they should, in order to make markets more competitive; to solve problems of externalities (which are ubiquitous); to resolve difficulties caused by individuals' shortsightedness, including the spurring of innovation; and to reduce transactions costs.

Craig Ewert’s suicide was assisted without complications in a Swiss clinic and filmed in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The European Commission proposed legislation Wednesday that would let drug companies give consumers "objective and nonpromotional" information about their medicines in print and online. Currently, drug companies can't provide any information to European consumers, except on leaflets found inside drug packaging. The legislative proposals must be approved by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers before becoming law, a process that could take years.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the US, it looks as though drug companies have agreed to largely meaningless reforms in advertising.  Jonathan Rockoff and Shirley Wang of the Journal &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122896253835797105.html"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that prescription drug marketers, represented by former congressman Billy Tauzin, have said, "...they will halt advertising that includes promoting prescription drugs for uses that the Food and Drug Administration hasn't approved or using actors as physicians without saying so. The guidelines say celebrity endorsers shouldn't say they use a drug unless they actually do."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's the big b.s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Billy Tauzin, president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group that issued the standards Wednesday, said the aim was to address the concerns of doctors, Congress and other critics while continuing to keep patients informed about valuable treatments.

&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to constantly look at [the ads] and see if we can improve them, so they are more informative, more educational and less promotional," Mr. Tauzin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How philanthropic!  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/two_developments_in_dtc_drug_m.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/481917701" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229023176610"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/amylase_and_human_evolution.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/32f0e688d2a92385</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Amylase and human evolution</title><published>2008-12-11T17:32:47Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T17:32:47Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/481877094/amylase_and_human_evolution.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/amylase_and_human_evolution.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blogging on Peer-Reviewed Research" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/rb.png" width="120" height="90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a mistake that was quickly corrected by a correspondent. Yesterday, in writing about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php"&gt;copy number variants in human genes&lt;/a&gt;, I used the example of the amylase gene on chromosome 1, which exists in variable numbers of copies in human populations, and my offhand remark was that the effect is "nothing that we can detect", but that maybe people with extra copies would be "especially good at breaking down french fries". Well, it turns out that we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; detect this, that there was even a very cool study of this enzyme published last year, and that the ability to break down complex starches rapidly may have been a significant factor in human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course I have to tell you all about this now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/amylase_and_human_evolution.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/amylase_and_human_evolution.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/481877094" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229023030602"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3487">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8460b6ad2b6c8ab9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="Nassim Nicholas Taleb"/><category term="statistics"/><title type="html">More or Less</title><published>2008-12-11T18:54:25Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T18:54:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/l-AgK0FB5BA/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/more-or-less/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">The author and Financial Times columnist Tim Harford is the presenter of the BBC   podcast More or Less, a 25-minute program about numbers and statistics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;(The webpage for the event is &lt;a href="http://www.daywithoutagay.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are stories all over the place, for instance &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081209/ap_on_re_us/calling_in_gay"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; suggested to me by Ben Zimmer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name "A Day Without a Gay" is based most immediately on "A Day Without a Mexican" (the title of a 2004 film, directed by Sergio Arau, about a day of Hispanic protest), and has the additional virtue of rhyming. But there are lots of "A Day Without X" precedents, among them: A Day Without Art (12/1/89), A Day Without Facebook (9/12/06), A Day Without Google (or any other major search engine, 6/12/07), and a proposal that, to save the oceans, you pick one day and make it A Day Without Plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Call in gay" is of course based on the idiom "call in sick (to work)". Ben Zimmer noted on ADS-L on 9 December:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that one inspiration for the snowclone-y substitution of "call in sick" with "call in gay" is this quote, attributed to lesbian activist Robin Tyler: "If homosexuality is a disease, let's all call in queer to work: 'Hello. Can't work today, still queer.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me a bit of the "driving while X" snowclone. Here are some other "call in X (to work)" variations attested on the Web: stupid, grumpy, sad, crazy, dead, drunk, ugly, fat, stinky, gray [referring to hair dye], gasless [from the days of high gas prices], empty [ditto], cold, well, healthy, rich, hysterical, constipated, allergic, seasonally affective, kidnapped, Republican, Democrat. (From a Google search of: {"call in * to work" -"call in sick|late|gay|queer"}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Many are of the negative form, "you can't call in X to work", or the interrogative, "can I call in X to work?")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Horn then added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also, in a related snowclone, "stage an X-out" (sick-out), I assume based on walk-out, such as staging a gay-out or queer-out. (Too close to outing?)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s always the blue flu for police job actions, although I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s sponsored snowclones, given the rhyme factor.  Hair stylists  staging a do-flu?  Tiger-cage cleaners putting on a zoo-flu? Underpaid rabbis organizing for…well, you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we're in the murky area between idioms with open slots in them and snowclones; notice that Ben Zimmer called the pattern "call in X" merely "snowclone-y". Both originate in some fixed expression, which is then varied by replacement of one (or more) of the parts by other items. It might not be profitable to try to draw a crisp line between small-scale snowclone-y patterns (snowclonelets?) and larger-scale snowclones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snowclonelet came past us a little while ago, in &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=879"&gt;my posting&lt;/a&gt; on "Whopper virgin". The original here is the simple lexical item &lt;em&gt;virgin&lt;/em&gt; 'someone who has not experienced sex' (for some sense of &lt;em&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt; — a topic for some future posting), which is varied by addition rather than replacement, to give &amp;quot;X virgin&amp;quot; &amp;#39;someone who has not experienced X&amp;#39;. There are tons of instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, still in the sexual arena, there's "oral virgin" (oral sex) and "anal virgin" (anal sex), with some variation in usage as to which roles (insertive, receptive, either, both) are referred to. And plenty of nonce creations, among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brickworks virgin [the Brick Works site in Toronto], Tolkien virgin [books by Tolkien], Glasto virgin [the Glastonbury music festivals], Pippi virgin [the Pippi Longstocking books], Bassmaster virgin [the Bassmaster Elite Series tournament, for bass fishing], tonsillolith virgin [tonsil stones], Cariban(a) virgin [the Caribana festival in Toronto], festie virgin [the Michigan Womyns Music Festival], bulgogi virgin [the Korean dish bulgogi], Astaire virgin [Fred Astaire movies], L&amp;amp;O virgin [the television show &lt;em&gt;Law and Order&lt;/em&gt;], Easterhegg virgin [annual event organized by Germany's Chaos Computer Club]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that 'someone who hasn't experienced X' is only a stab at the actual meanings. "X virgin" expressions are in fact noun-noun compounds, and as we've pointed out several times in Language Log (for instance, &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=437"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the semantic relationship between the two nouns in such compounds can be quite complex and indirect. An Astaire virgin, for instance, is not really someone who hasn't experienced an Astaire, but refers to experience with something involving a particular Astaire (Fred and not Adele), namely the experience of watching movies starring Fred Astaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/obama_griffin.jpg" alt="Obama and Griffin"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reports of arguments, back-room meetings, managing of messages, and so on. The reports in the article are anonymous (though from multiple unnamed sources), so take them with some skepticism. However, there is also a ring of truth to them in my ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Griffin must know his chance of staying on as NASA chief is very low; his &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/06/01/nasa-administrator-griffin-saying-global-warming-is-bad-is-arrogant/"&gt;ridiculous statements about global warming&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2007/06/07/griffin-regrets-saying-what-he-thinks/"&gt;luke-warm apology later&lt;/a&gt;) pretty much guarantee that. I imagine Obama has quite a list of potential replacements, and if I know that, so does Griffin. The Constellation program — the next step in manned space flight, designed to get us back to the Moon and eventually to Mars — is Griffin’s baby, and I would guess he’s concerned that the new Obama Administration may attack it. This would understandably make Griffin defensive, and he would do what he can to ensure the program will continue after he is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m concerned about that too, in fact. Constellation has problems, and of course is over budget, but I think it’s the right move for the space agency right now. The Shuttle is being retired (as well it should; it was originally a good idea, but even by the time &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; first launched in 1981 the system was a white elephant), and love it or hate it, the manned space exploration program must go on. That’s where the money is from Congress, and that’s what the public thinks of when they think NASA. I wish NASA would do a better job of promoting the unmanned program — remember, if you read this blog you probably are predisposed to supporting scientific exploration, which makes you a person who is not a typical member of the public! — but until then, the manned work is the agency’s bread and butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been and probably always will be ambivalent about Griffin. He has done some magnificent work at NASA, but has also really stepped in it. I still wonder what his role was in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/02/04/outrage-at-attacks-on-nasa-science/"&gt;the Deutsch affair&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/04/followup-on-msl-griffins-spin/"&gt;I’ve disagreed with his spin&lt;/a&gt; on other issues as well. But NASA has done OK under his command, which, let’s face it, has seen some very difficult times. I hope that if and when Obama picks a new person to head NASA, it’s again an engineer like Griffin, someone who has had their sleeves rolled up before when it comes to working on the space program. And I hope that Griffin makes that possible as well. Obama’s and Griffin’s teams may have a lot to disagree about, but I hope they can work that out and understand that the overall, overarching goal is to keep NASA strong, vigorous, and healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of humanity is in space. Politics should be making that easier to achieve, not harder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229020332659"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-3809928748599507436">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/936647322d094e99</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Blogs" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Denyse O'Leary Loses!</title><published>2008-12-11T18:17:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T18:25:21Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/denyse-oleary-loses.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/3809928748599507436/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=3809928748599507436" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> The results are in and Denyse O&amp;#39;Leary&amp;#39;s blog Post-Darwinist did not win in the Best Canadian Sci/Tech category.

&lt;p&gt;I made a mistake that was quickly corrected by a correspondent. Yesterday, in writing about &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php"&gt;copy number variants in human genes&lt;/a&gt;, I used the example of the amylase gene on chromosome 1, which exists in variable numbers of copies in human populations, and my offhand remark was that the effect is "nothing that we can detect", but that maybe people with extra copies would be "especially good at breaking down french fries". Well, it turns out that we &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; detect this, that there was even a very cool study of this enzyme published last year, and that the ability to break down complex starches rapidly may have been a significant factor in human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course I have to tell you all about this now.&lt;/p&gt;
        

&lt;p&gt;Amylase is a digestive enzyme that specifically helps break down complex sugars, like starch, into simpler sugars that can be processed by other enzymes or absorbed by the intestine. You are secreting this enzyme all the time into your saliva, so that as soon as you pop something made of starchy carbohydrates, it's coated with these enzymes that get to work breaking it down. As it's swallowed and enters the stomach and intestine, these enzymes are still busy rendering the starches down into something more manageable for your gut to handle. This is an important function: if you chew starchy foods made from rice, corn, or potatoes, saturating them with the enzyme, blood glucose levels afterwards are measurably higher than if you just swallow the food whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, the amylase gene has another interesting attribute — it seems to be in a hotspot for duplication, and different people have different numbers of copies of the gene. If you just had one copy of the gene per chromosome, your cells would each have a grand total of two copies…but instead, we more typically have 5 to 7, with some people having only 2, and others having 15 or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to count how many copies of the gene there are, but one of the more visually appealing ways is to use fiber FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization). In this technique, intact DNA is extracted from cells and stretched out, then a probe for the amylase gene that is tagged with a fluorescent label is allowed to bind to the strand, and every place with an amylase gene lights up red. As you can see below, then you can directly count the genes: in this case, the individual at the top has 14 copies of the gene on two chromosomes, the one in the middle has six copies, and the very interesting fellow named Clint at the bottom has only two copies. Clint happens to be a chimpanzee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="fiber_FISH.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/11/fiber_FISH.jpeg" width="357" height="520"&gt;&lt;br&gt;High-resolution ﬁber FISH validation of AMY1 copy number 
estimates. Red (~10 kb) and green (~8 kb) probes encompass the entire 
AMY1 gene and a retrotransposon directly upstream of (and unique to) 
AMY1, respectively. (a) Japanese individual GM18972 was estimated by 
qPCR to have 14 (13.73 ± 0.93) diploid AMY1 gene copies, consistent with 
ﬁber FISH results showing one allele with ten copies and the other with four 
copies. (b) Biaka individual GM10472 was estimated by qPCR to have six 
(6.11 ± 0.17) diploid AMY1 gene copies, consistent with ﬁber FISH results. 
(c) The reference chimpanzee (Clint; S006006) was conﬁrmed to have two 
diploid AMY1 gene copies.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chimpanzees don&amp;#39;t exhibit much copy number variation in the amylase gene, but humans do…how interesting. Could this variation be a reflection of something specific in human evolution? Why, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work by Perry and others went on to look for patterns in different human populations with different dietary historys, and discovered that there is a correlation: cultures with diets heavy in starch, agricultural populations such as Americans, Europeans, and Japanese, or hunter-gathers who live on many roots and tubers, have a higher average copy number than cultures that depend more on hunting and fishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the distributions! Populations with little starch in their diets also have a relatively low copy number of 5.44 amylase genes per individual; we french fry eaters have a higher number of 6.72 amylase genes per individual. The difference is small, and the distributions also overlap significantly (note that some with high starch diets only have 2 copies, and some living on low starch diets have 13 copies), but the difference is measurable and significant. It &lt;i&gt;implies&lt;/i&gt; that there may have been some selection for greater copy numbers in cultures with diets high in starchy plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="amy_copy_number.jpeg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/11/amy_copy_number.jpeg" width="425" height="689"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Diet and AMY1 copy number variation. (a) Comparison of qPCR-estimated AMY1 diploid copy number frequency distributions for populations 
with traditional diets that incorporate many starch-rich foods (high-starch) 
and populations with traditional diets that include little or no starch (low- 
starch). (b) Cumulative distribution plot of diploid AMY1 copy number for 
each of the seven populations in the study.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can't entirely rule out drift as a possible cause of the difference; while we can see differences in the enzyme levels in saliva, low levels of the enzyme haven't been shown to be directly deleterious to anyone. It is again implied: oral digestion of starches may be an important pathway for taking in energy during episodes of diarrhea, so it could be critical when individuals are experiencing disease-related stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very suggestive. The fact that it represents a distinct difference between other apes, such as chimpanzees, and ourselves also suggests that it may have had significant evolutionary consequences. Maybe we aren't primarily the biggest-brained apes; we are the Apes Who Eat Roots As Well As Bananas. A core nutritional difference could have played a more significant factor in our early evolution than small differences in brain size, and may have been an enabler of brain expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

More photos at &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arealgirl/"&gt;my Flickr page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Although this isn’t strictly the place for this, I got tagged with an internet meme.  I’m the sort that doesn’t do memes, doesn’t do forwarding, etc.  But this one was kind of cool.  I had to go to the 6th page of my Flickr photostream, look at the 6th photo, and blog about it.  At the time I wrote this (but not anymore,) that photo was this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s me, half-dressed, at Dragon*Con.  I’m with Evo Terra, who &lt;a href="http://evoat11.com/"&gt;I visited last week in Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.  He runs &lt;a href="http://podiobooks.com/"&gt;Podiobooks.com&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m a total podcast junkie, especially podcast fiction, so this was kind of like me meeting (and hugging) my pusher.  We’d just met that night, and he couldn’t have been cooler about me crashing his party and insisting on bartending.  Evo sometimes comments here at Skepchick, and is (in my experience) a great guy, good friend, and all around bon vivant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got tagged by my friend &lt;a href="http://www.onthecreativeside.com/"&gt;Sheila&lt;/a&gt;, who happens to be Evo’s spouse. If this were any other site but Skepchick, or I were a different kind of girl, I’d say that couldn’t have been just coincidence.  Of course, it was just coincidence.  And I’m not a different kind of girl.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>a.real.girl</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229018376456"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-8819657398687462663">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c326eee2965df6bc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Society" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</title><published>2008-12-11T14:59:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T15:13:15Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/universal-declaration-of-human-rights.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/8819657398687462663/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=8819657398687462663" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Yesterday was the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

A lot of scientists I know are praising this decision. I am tentatively supportive of this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Chu’s understanding of science is of course rock solid, being the Secretary of a government Department is a &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; job. Now, Chu does have political experience. In 2004 he was appointed to be the Director of the Lawrence Berkeley Lab in California, was chair of the Stanford physics department before that, and is also involved with some international projects that do involve considerable political savvy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chu doesn’t seem to have experience in the American government’s political system, and I’m weighing in my head how much of a concern that is. The current Energy Secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, had quite a bit of experience before taking on the role, and the Secretary before him was a State Senator. I disagree pretty strongly with the political stances of both of those men, but they did have political careers before they became Secretary. Looking at other Departments, their heads have a various amount of political expertise, some with very little indeed, and that has led to some disastrous situations in this country. On the balance, I think Chu has more political experience than many of these people, so that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This choice does make me happy of a lot of reasons: he’s a scientist, for cripes sake! He is an activist when it comes to global warming. He has worked very hard on creating collaborations between disparate groups of people. He has no experience with Arabian horses that I can find, so that makes him way ahead of the typical hack Bush appointee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I think this is a good choice from Obama, but I’d like to see more information. If he does get chosen, the vetting process should reveal more of his history and his ability to take on this role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again: the very fact that he is a scientist indicates a whole new ball game politically here in the United States of America. January 20, 2009 cannot come quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229011269898"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3497">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b3d55db840ef3e9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="corruption"/><category term="government"/><category term="rod blagojevich"/><title type="html">New York Governor Highlights the Dismal Record of Senate Appointments</title><published>2008-12-11T16:13:57Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T16:13:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/ftBZBzA7Mrg/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/new-york-governor-highlights-the-dismal-record-of-senate-appointments/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Yesterday we wondered how the Blagojevich Affair would influence other politicians who need to fill vacant seats in the Senate or elsewhere.

&lt;p&gt;For once, I haven't forgotten my blogiversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, as hard as it is to believe, I've been at this more or less nonstop just as long as a Presidential term in office. It all began on a dank, overcast Saturday afternoon in December four years ago today. What whim struck me to sit down in front of my computer and use Blogger to create my &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com"&gt;original blog&lt;/a&gt; I have no idea, but I did. Maybe it was because I had become tired of sparring with Holocaust deniers in the Usenet newsgroup alt.revisionism and with alt-med mavens like Ilena Rosenthal on misc.health.alternative, as well as other advocates of pseudoscience on other newsgroups. Such writing, while fun, was reactive against pseudoscience and irrationality, and I had decided to become proactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so Respectful Insolence was born with &lt;a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2004/12/please-allow-me-to-introduce-myself.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/as_long_as_a_presidential_term_in_office.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/as_long_as_a_presidential_term_in_office.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/481711753" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229006730897"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4652">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8f3cb4f19dc79d0a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 12.11</title><published>2008-12-11T14:30:13Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T14:30:13Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4652" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

Jon Stewart goes right to the topic I would have and asks a lot of the same questions I wish I could. And, you get the impression he’s just as dissatisfied with the answers as I would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style="padding-right:0px;display:inline;padding-left:0px;float:none;padding-bottom:0px;margin:0px;padding-top:0px"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He really gets to the crux of the Gay Marriage debate which is that there is no good secular argument against it. It’s great to see him force one of the religious right’s more likeable leaders to dance around the issue, because it shows that even the comparably sane and intelligent portion of that segment of society still can’t just answer a question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, as far as I can tell, only three non-religious rationales behind banning gay marriage that are ever even proffered and one is off topic. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. It’s bad for everyone’s children. I heard this a lot in the debate about the California initiative, parents saying &amp;quot;I don’t want my children to have to learn about gay people.&amp;quot; I don’t know where CNN found all of those Californians without basic cable to interview, but trust me ladies and gentlemen, your kids already know.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s 2008. Your kids are going to become aware that there is a such thing as same-sex couples. Little Timmy having two mommies isn’t going to be their first exposure, and even if it were, gay people already have children all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can’t restrict a civil liberty just because it means kids may have to learn about it in school before you’re ready for them to. I’m sure some people once didn’t want their children learning about interracial marriages for the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Gay couples are unfit to raise children. I would actually be open to hearing about this if the argument were over whether or not gay couples were allowed to adopt. You’d have to prove it (which would be tough because almost all data points to the opposite conclusion) but at least it wouldn’t be a straw man. But in reality gay marriage and gay adoption aren’t the same, and arguments against one, even if they were correct, wouldn’t be arguments against another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, if conservatives believe so heavily in marriage, and they don’t want to stop gays from adopting, they should want them to marry. I realize that sentence was logic, which is kryptonite to the religious right, but it’s true. If they’re already having children, and marriage makes them better parents, it’s in everyone’s best interest that they be allowed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. It’s the way it’s always been. This is by far the most common one. As Stewart points out, for one, it isn’t the way it’s always been. It’s the way it’s been for a while, but not back in the Biblical times social conservatives seem to want to use as a template for modern society. Our marriage system would be almost totally unrecognizable to them. Women marrying in their late twenties to men they actually chose? Unheard of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if it were the way it has always been, that wouldn’t make it right. Slavery had always been legal on this continent, until it wasn’t anymore. Women were always not allowed to vote, until they could. Even most social conservatives wouldn’t argue that those precedents were good ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that’s the fundamental difference between the socially progressives and the conservatives. Progressives realize that just because something is done one way, and has been done that way for awhile, doesn’t mean it’s right. Conservatives think &amp;quot;that’s the way it’s always been done&amp;quot; is a legitimate argument for anything, even when it hasn’t always been done that way and they’re just too ignorant to know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every great moment of human progress came when someone realized that the way it’s always been done was wrong. Every scientific advance, every great business, every great political movement. Each one has someone behind it who realized that there was a better way than the present one. Einstein realized that the way we thought about time and space was wrong. Sam Walton realized that many things about the way retail chains operated was wrong. Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement realized many of our laws were evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no shocker that the GDP per capita of the socially conservative states trails so  far behind that of the blue, they’re too busy doing things the way they’ve always been done to invent the ways we’ll do them in the future. And unfortunately our electoral college gives them disproportionate power allowing them (as happened in 2000, when they lost the popular vote but won the election due to it) to hold our nation in place against its own collective will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huckabee mentions that not all people who want to ban gay marriage are homophobic. I suppose that’s true. They’re not afraid of gay people (not all of them anyway) they’re afraid of change. They’re progressophobic. &lt;/p&gt;

This provoked immediate questions and counter-claims. So I promised to devote a Breakfast Experiment™ to quantifying the choice among alternative verb forms used to express future time in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the questions and counter-claims.  Joe &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=897#comment-14156"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Is that true? "Going to/gonna" seems fairly common as well. When I was an EFL teacher I paid a lot of attention to the use of "will" and "going to" in conversations with other teachers, and based on my observations I feel like "going to" is actually more common. Is there a way to find out the statistics on these things?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response was to modify my original statement, to say that &amp;quot;… a common way to express a future-time meaning is …&amp;quot;, since in fact I had no evidence to offer about relative frequencies, only a guess. In contrast, Language Hat &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=897#comment-14164"&gt;was in no doubt about the matter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;I think it's important to emphasize that "will" is not even the most common way to express a future meaning; the simple "present" is, I believe, more common in contemporary colloquial English. "We're going tomorrow" seems to me much more natural than "We will go tomorrow."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response, again, is that we need to look at the facts. Though I agree with Steve's judgment about the cited example, it strikes me as not entirely typical.  "We will" would be "we'll" even in less formal written English these days. And the implied context seems to me to shade the meaning in a direction that's more friendly to &lt;strong&gt;going to&lt;/strong&gt;, in those situations where it's available as an alternative to forms of &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's start by clarifying the nature and scope of this morning's experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we're looking only at the forms of finite verbs used in clauses used to describe future-time events, states and so on, in contemporary American English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I'm going to ignore things like "I promise to be good"  or "The future is bright", even though it's not obvious that their time reference is pragmatically much different from "I'll be good" or "Things are gonna be great". However, I'll include things like "until they arrive" or "when I yell 'go'", even though English pretty much insists on the present tense in constructions of that type. We'd get slightly different counts by looking only at finite verbs in main clauses, but that seems like an artificial restriction to me. And where I'm unsure about whether an example should be counted, I'll count it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, as I said in responding to Joe, it&amp;#39;s clear that genre, register and even topic make a difference. So I&amp;#39;ll look at a variety of  sources, consistent with the need to get on with my day by 9:00 a.m. or so. Let me stipulate that this is not an adequate sample — but perhaps it&amp;#39;ll be enough to suggest the way the wind is blowing. In any case, it&amp;#39;s a step up from simple assertions of divergent opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, the first sample is a political speech, full of promises about the future: the transcript of president-elect Obama's &lt;a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/the_key_parts_of_the_jobs_plan/"&gt;December 6 radio address&lt;/a&gt; about his economic plans. In 773 words, he used forms of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 25 times. Of these, 4 were the negative form "won't" (&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We won’t do it the old Washington way"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), 14 were spelled "will" in the transcript (&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It will put people back to work"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) , and 7 were spelled "'ll" (&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We’ll invest your precious tax   dollars in new and smarter ways"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). He used present tense for future time reference in 2 when-clauses (&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;When Congress reconvenes&lt;/strong&gt; in January, I look forward to working with them   to pass a plan immediately"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). There were no examples of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;going to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gonna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second sample is a press release, a genre that is sometimes also  future-oriented — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.law.stanford.edu/news/pr/106/Stanford%20Law%20School%20Launches%20Intellectual%20Property%20Litigation%20Clearinghouse/"&gt;Stanford Law School Launches Intellectual Property Litigation Clearinghouse&lt;/a&gt;", 12/8/2008. In 1282 words, there were 4 examples of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and one example of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that I judged to involve a clear future-time reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;We are very excited about the research opportunities now available, as   well as how &lt;strong&gt;the results of such research may aid the legal community&lt;/strong&gt; not   only in resolving disputes, but also in reducing the costs of resolution   and providing insights for business and policy decision makers in the   future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third sample is a news story — &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/business/11bair.html"&gt;Fighting Foreclosures, F.D.I.C. Chief Draws Fire&lt;/a&gt;", NYT, 12/10/2008. Along with 4 forms of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2 of "will", one of "'ll", and one "won't"), there are 2 present-tense future references in main clauses. One is in a quote from the FDIC chair Sheila Bair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;And at the end of the day, &lt;strong&gt;I’m happy&lt;/strong&gt; if Treasury just picks a plan and   does it. Even if it’s not my plan, its better what we’re doing right now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is in a quote from an anonymous White House official (which also features a future-time &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re done&lt;/strong&gt; in two months. The next   administration &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; try to find a way out of that maze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;is more than holding its own — 33 forms of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, vs. a total of 6 future-time references using other verbal forms: 2 plain present tense in when-clauses, 2 plain present-tense references in main clauses, 1 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 1 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Even subtracting the political speech, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is winning 8 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is all formal written language, except for the quotations in the news story. Let's look at something more colloquial. I'll stack the deck by searching blogpulse.com for "gonna" and taking the top four posts from &lt;a href="http://johnrflynn.com/blog/"&gt;the first U.S.-based blog I find&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, there's just 1 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gonna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 1 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;going to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 3 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 4 &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'ll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and 1 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (in a song quote &lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;"Shall we dance? Or maybe just limp around?"&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let's try  &lt;a href="http://landeasyyy.livejournal.com/"&gt;another blog&lt;/a&gt; found by searching for "gonna".  This one is much more colloquial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Wow. I haven't pulled an all nighter and Felt THIS fine. it took me about 4hours to do my essay because i really tried. I was about to fall asleep until i got done, and i woke up! lOL. i was like fuck it. im gonna do homework all morning so i dont have to do it tonight. But yeahh.. its gonna be a bitch going to work 2-6. Probably bust home and nap an hour or so. Then mandatory Gyming with Justin. I guess i need an energy drink today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three entries are available. I count 5 &lt;strong&gt;gonna&lt;/strong&gt;, 3 &lt;strong&gt;'ll&lt;/strong&gt;, 1 &lt;strong&gt;won't&lt;/strong&gt;, 1 future-time &lt;strong&gt;don't&lt;/strong&gt;, and 3 present-tense future references in subordinate clauses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It'll be something &lt;strong&gt;we hopefully do&lt;/strong&gt; til &lt;strong&gt;we're old men&lt;/strong&gt; smoking out of a pipe when &lt;strong&gt;cannibus is legal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even in this case, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gonna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; only accounts for 5 of 13 futures, and barely beats out forms of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. (It's also pretty clear that in this sort of English, there are differences in meaning among the various alternative choices for verbal expression of future-time reference.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about genuine conversational transcription? I picked four conversations at random from the &lt;a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC97S62"&gt;Switchboard Corpus&lt;/a&gt;, and found 16 forms of &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;, 6 instances of &lt;strong&gt;going to&lt;/strong&gt;, and 5 examples of future-time reference in (other) present tense clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative conclusions? In formal written English, forms of &lt;strong&gt;will &lt;/strong&gt;are by far the commonest way to express future time reference in tensed clauses.  In more informal writing and in speech, forms of &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; are less dominant, but apparently still very much in the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger-scale experiment might count corpus instances of the strings "will", "'ll", "going to", etc., and then check by hand a random sample of each collection, in order to estimate overall corpus frequencies. This kind string-search-based method will not catch other uses of plain present-tense verbs for future-time reference, but it would give a more reliable estimate of the relative frequency of &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; vs. &lt;strong&gt;going to&lt;/strong&gt; in various kinds of material. This would take several breakfast periods, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: in an odd moment between other chores, I scanned &lt;a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4846"&gt;this web forum discussion&lt;/a&gt;, which is a regular orgy of speculation about the future. I counted 293 forms of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (283 "will" and 10 "'ll") to 33 instances of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ("gonna" didn't occur), which is almost exactly the 9-to-1 ratio cited by Alex Boulton in the comment below (293/33 = 8.88). ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1229003823418"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=437">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ab87ada4978e1b67</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science and the Media"/><category term="Science and Medicine"/><title type="html">New Stats on CAM Usage</title><published>2008-12-11T13:51:44Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T13:51:44Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=437" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/12/10/alternative-therapies-have-gone-mainstream/"&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; declares, “Alternative Therapies Have Gone Mainstream.” &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/10/AR2008121001601.html"&gt;The Washington Pos&lt;/a&gt;t claims, “Survey Documents Rise in Alternative Treatments.” (That headline was in the RSS feed.) &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE4B95XO20081210"&gt;Reuters &lt;/a&gt;writes, “Many Americans turning to unconventional medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fail!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are talking about the &lt;a href="http://nccam.nih.gov/news/2008/nhsr12.pdf"&gt;2007 National Health Statistics report&lt;/a&gt; on CAM use by Americans.  This data was actually released in September. I went through the statistics at the time and &lt;a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=203"&gt;reported on them for Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. I guess that was too much work for most journalists, so they waited three months to be spoon-fed the data by the NCCAM. They also appear to have been spoon-fed their conclusions, for none of the outlets even comes close to getting it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the statistics show the opposite of what the headlines proclaim - for as long as statistics have been gathered on CAM use the numbers have been remarkably stable - not increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the actual numbers reported by the survey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Modality                       % used Ever             2002                 2007&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture                   	6.55                          1.1                    1.4&lt;br&gt;
Ayurveda                        	0.56&lt;br&gt;
Biofeedback                    	1.23                           0.1                    0.2&lt;br&gt;
Chelation                         	0.34&lt;br&gt;
Chiropractic or&lt;br&gt;
Osteo Manipulation      	21.91                         7.5                    8.6&lt;br&gt;
Energy Healing                1.72                          0.5                   0.5&lt;br&gt;
Hypnosis                         	2.34                          0.2                    0.2&lt;br&gt;
Massage                          	16.02                        5.0                    8.3&lt;br&gt;
Naturopathy                   	1.51                          0.2                    0.3&lt;br&gt;
Homeopathy                   	3.65                          1.7                     1.8&lt;br&gt;
tai chi                                 0.9&lt;br&gt;
qi gong                               	0.6&lt;br&gt;
yoga                                  	9.53                          5.1                     6.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers are not significantly different than 20 years ago. Also, the “significant increase” that proponents are crowing about and the press are parroting are hardly significant. The numbers for manipulative therapies in 2007 include chiropractic and osteopathy while the 2002 numbers include chiropractic only, so the comparison is not valid. Massage increased by 3.3 percent. Otherwise the numbers are static or just slightly increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the numbers reveal the hollowness of the CAM label - what does CAM really mean? The numbers are inflated by including items that are not necessarily out of the mainstream. Massage is a perfectly reasonable modality for muscle relaxation. I would only consider it “alternative” if pseudoscientific therapeutic claims were being made for it, and this survey does not capture that information. Biofeedback is established for stress reduction and some symptomatic relief of tension headache and similar conditions. Yoga is exercise and stretching. Also, manipulative therapy is reasonable for uncomplicated acute lower back strain, with is what about 60% of manipulation is used for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you factor out these modalities (and also legitimate use of nutrition), the numbers remaining are all quite low - in the single digits, and not significantly increasing. Only 1.8% of the population used homeopathy, 1.4 acupuncture, 0.3 naturopathy, and 0.5 energy healing. For these hard-core CAM modalities usage is still marginal and not really changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the headline should read is, “Despite unfounded hype, political activism, poor regulation, and promotion by gullible media - use of CAM modalities remains minimal and fringe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington post reports “38% of Adults use Alternative Medicine.” But as should now be clear, that 38% figure is inflated and misleading. They also did not question or explore the “alternative” label. What they did do is quote Dr. David Eisenberg, who has been misrepresenting CAM statistics for years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s fair to say we can conclude that this is part of the steady state of medical care in the United States,” said David Eisenberg, director of the Harvard Medical School’s division for research and education in complementary and integrative medical therapies. “I think the news is complementary and alternative medicine use by the U.S. public is here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is fair to say that the abuse of statistics by CAM proponents to create the illusion of mainstream acceptance, despite the numbers, is here to stay. This is nothing more than pro-CAM propaganda, unfiltered by journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For balance they did interview Wallace Sampson, who also blogs with me at SBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are either unproven or disproven,” said Wallace Sampson, founding editor of the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. “Acupuncture is a placebo. Homeopathy is one step above fraud. It goes on and on. The fact that they are so widely used is evidence for how gullible large segments of our society are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know from my prior discussions with him that Wally believes the numbers to be inflated exactly as I have discussed, so I suspect he was selectively quoted here. His point is legitimate, but does not address the bigger deception that I discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also quote Stephen Barrett from Quackwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a tremendous amount of money being wasted on this,” said Stephen Barrett, who runs Quackwatch (&lt;a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/"&gt;http://www.quackwatch.org&lt;/a&gt;), which monitors false medical claims. “That money could be used to do research on something that has been waiting in line to get money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again - a legitimate point. But there was nothing in the article discussing the misrepresentation of the numbers, and if the reporter, Rob Stein, spoke to Wally Sampson and Steve Barrett it is very likely that he was made aware of this concern. (I will ask them about this and add an addendum when I have more information.) It seems as if the media had their story - CAM gone mainstream - and that was the story they were going to write. Quotes from skeptics are usually just plug ins, they don’t alter the main theme of the story itself. This is a disturbing habit among journalists - writing the story prior to doing the research, and conducting interviews only to provide quotes to plug into the existing story framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am always annoyed by such journalistic failures when dealing with CAM, I am at least heartened that the numbers for use of core CAM modalities remains so low and are barely fluctuating. And at least now the media are (sometimes) adding at least token scientific comments. Perhaps there’s hope after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Addendum added 12/16/08&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one mainstream outlet, US News and World Report, saw through the spin and hype to the real numbers. &lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/blogs/comarow-on-quality/2008/12/12/alternative-medicines-rapid-spread-nonsense.html"&gt;Avery Comarow&lt;/a&gt; gets it right.&lt;/p&gt;

You can read my challenge &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/christian-apologists-i-challenge-all-of.html"&gt;directly below this post&lt;/a&gt;. I have recently decided to go on the offensive.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One reason is because I'm tired of some of the skeptical arguments I've seen. Another reason is because I'm getting more and more feedback almost every single day from Christian people who have read my book and say they cannot adequately deal with it. One seminary trained pastor said my book only leaves open the possibilty of some sort of religious mysticism. And today I learned that yet another well-read Christian has lost his faith from reading just one book, mine. He had read Michael Martin's book, &lt;em&gt;The Case Against Christianity&lt;/em&gt;, and David Ramsay Steele's book, &lt;em&gt;Atheism Explained&lt;/em&gt; (both great books), but his faith was not affected at all until he read mine. &lt;strong&gt;[Edit: This morning my book was ranked #1 on the blog titled &lt;a href="http://failingtheinsidertest.blogspot.com/2008/12/book-reviews.html"&gt;Failing the Insider Test&lt;/a&gt; (check it out! This Blog seems to be a spin-off from my &lt;em&gt;Outsider Test for Faith&lt;/em&gt;). He says my book is "Head and shoulders" above the rest.].&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still another reason is that many Christians hate me anyway. If you do, it's not my problem. I'm not here to win friends. I'm here to help you take back your brainwashed selves. I have Christian Blog terrorists at my feet sooner or later whenever I leave the door open for a free and respectful discussion of the ideas that separate us. And I've decided that I really don't care if other skeptics agree with how I argue. I am not writing for them! They are not my target audience. You are! Mine is an arrogance about the arguments. I have them. You don't. [Plenty of other skeptics have great arguments too, so don't get me wrong about this]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just to be sure, there is no personal animosity toward Christians as the good people I think most of you are. I like most Christians. That's not the issue. My claim is that not a single one of you can effectively and honestly deal with every argument in my book, any one of which is fatal to your faith (and I mean conservative Christians). Call me arrogant if you will. I don't care. Bring it on. Every day you wait, another soul might be lost from reading my book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't revel in knowing some Christian people will probably suffer pain as the result of agonizing over their faith along with the social repercussions from leaving it. I'm only interested in educating people about Christianity. It's a delusion. You are deluded. And I am here to help you get over it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The fine for committing one of the most heinous acts imaginable against a virgin woman without God’s permission is a pound of silver paid to her father and a forced marriage to the victim.  (Deut 22:28-29) Yes, God’s idea of justice for the raped woman is to be horrendously punished again by forcing her to marry the man who savagely attacked her. This disgusting rule is nowhere near what most people would consider an ethical resolution, and it’s certainly not a decision rendered by any court I would like to be facing. On the other hand, a man who rapes an engaged virgin or a married woman will be stoned to death, not because he committed a brutal atrocity against the woman, but because he “violated another man’s wife.” (Deut 22:24-25)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note the shamefully sharp contrast in disciplinary action between raping a woman with a husband and raping a woman without a husband: death versus a pound of silver. Since being raped is certainly all the same to the woman, it now becomes clear that God feels the husband is the one who is the victim of the attack. Raping a woman of your choice who does not have a husband allows you to marry the woman of your choice, but raping a woman who already belongs to another man warrants the death sentence. I could talk for days without overstating the evil absurdity of these rules. I simply cannot have any respect for any Christian who reads these regulations, acknowledges them, and makes excuses for them because they are part of the Old Testament. At no time should this philosophy have been law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been asserted by Christian apologists that Deut 22:28-29 speaks of consensual sex, and not rape. There are several reasons why I believe this is unfeasible. The argument that "to take (taphas) and lay with (shakab)" do not refer to rape is invalidated by Genesis 34:2, in which "to take (laqach) and lay with (shakab)" is long understood to be a case of rape. Strong's confirms that Taphas and Laqach (and Chazaq in Deut 22:25 for that matter) are closely related synonyms. The idea that this isn't rape because the author didn't reuse Chazaq (from 22:25) in Deut 22:29 also does not hold up because one could make the same argument that Chazaq doesn't imply rape because Laqach (from Gen 34) wsn't reused in Deut 22:25 and again in Deut 22:29. The clear meaning of taphas, laqach, and chazaq when used in conjunction with shakab is to take/handle/hold by force (granted that chazaq appears to be stronger than either taphas or laqach, but laqach (Gen 34) is no stronger than taphas (Deut 22). Cases of pure adultery in Deut 22 do not mention any sort of "taking" or "forcing," only "laying with." The only argument left for the apologist is to suggest that Dinah was not raped in Genesis 34:2, but the context from later in Genesis 34 casts doubt on this hypothesis. And we know women were possessions in the OT, so let's not pretend otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comments appreciated but my time will be limited this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pareidolia is putting the Virgin Mary in all sorts of strange places. The latest: in the &lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/dec/05/virgin-mary-fort-pierce-womans-brain-scan-next-sto/"&gt;MRI of a woman's brain&lt;/a&gt;. She's trying to sell it off on eBay, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a silly illusion, but as I looked at it, I had an epiphany. It's a body part. There's a little nubbin for a head beneath a hood, with fleshy veils representing Mary's robes below that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, there&amp;#39;s another anatomical region on women that looks like that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when is someone going to start selling gynecological photos on eBay? Can we defend explicit porn as religious iconography?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, there is a poll associated with this story: "Do you see the Virgin Mary in this MRI?" No is ahead with 49% of the vote so far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/mary_gets_around.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/481451483" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228976645138"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/hungarian_phrasebook_sketch_co.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0bee0ff26b22672</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Hungarian phrasebook sketch comes to life</title><published>2008-12-11T05:59:05Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T05:59:05Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/481353265/hungarian_phrasebook_sketch_co.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/hungarian_phrasebook_sketch_co.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see a magazine with Chinese calligraphy on the cover, which I cannot read at all, I have to wonder if it means something strange, like 
"&lt;a href="http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/hungry.htm"&gt;My nipples explode with delight&lt;/a&gt;". The journal of the Max Planck Research Institute was hit by this little problem: &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/home/technology/how-eminent-science-mag-got-hit-for-sex/2008/12/11/1228584998876.html"&gt;they used some lovely Chinese calligraphy on their cover without looking up the meaning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

KK and Jiamei as directors, who will personally lead jade-like girls in the spring of youth,

Beauties from the north who have a distinguished air of elegance and allure,

Young housewives having figures that will turn you on;

Their enchanting and coquettish performance will begin within the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops. Max Planck Forschung apparently ran an ad for a Chinese brothel or strip club on their cover. At least they didn't get it as a &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/02/fashion/sundaystyles/02tattoos.html"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt;, and have reissued the magazine with a new cover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/hungarian_phrasebook_sketch_co.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/481353265" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228975860835"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f24e30534bc66da</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Christopher Bedgood</title><published>2008-12-11T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/medical/bedgood.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">E-mailed plea solicits Christmas cards for a little boy suffering from cancer.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228973106374"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/semantics_is_cold_comfort_when.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fb12e05b7a44f727</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Semantics is cold comfort when it comes to humanity</title><published>2008-12-11T05:07:02Z</published><updated>2008-12-11T05:07:02Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/481309782/semantics_is_cold_comfort_when.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/semantics_is_cold_comfort_when.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mike Huckabee is a smug little hypocrite who tries to defend his opposition to gay marriage by arguing that a) it's traditional (never mind that marriage has changed greatly since biblical times), b) it's natural and necessary for procreation (ignoring the fact that a childless marriage is still regarded as a marriage), and c) that you can't redefine the magic word "marriage" (yeah, like language never evolves). &lt;a title="Jon Stewart smacks down Mike Huckabee on gay marriage | Crooks and Liars" href="http://crooksandliars.com/silentpatriot/jon-stewart-vs-mike-huckabee-gay-mar"&gt;Jon Stewart makes him squirm over his position&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guy in North Carolina has the original flying saucer spaceship model from the movie &amp;quot;Forbidden Planet&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_11180380"&gt;and he’s auctioning it off to pay for his bills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (specifically, electricity to power his Christmas lights).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction is Thursday, and if any BABloggee has $100,000 they want to give me, I’ll let you come to my house after I buy the ship and I’ll even let you hold it. But only for a second. [Edited to add: assuming this thing is legit. Rereading the news article it occurs to me that this guy may be, um, well, not so legit.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh man. I would love to have that ship. &amp;quot;Forbidden Planet&amp;quot; is awesome, a classic. And it’s a &lt;em&gt;flying saucer!&lt;/em&gt; That &lt;em&gt;rawks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In this space &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/07/antivax_lies_from_a_local_repo.php"&gt;we've dealt with some of the problems&lt;/a&gt; that arise when "generalist" reporters try to "do" science and medicine.  And now, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/purepedantry/2008/12/boo_on_you_cnn.php"&gt;CNN has shut down its science unit&lt;/a&gt;.  Given the increasing complexity of medical and scientific knowledge, this is very bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fine example of poor medical reporting, &lt;a href="http://www.dbusiness.com/DBusiness/November-2008/The-Fatigue-Factor/"&gt;let's look at a local business magazine&lt;/a&gt;.  The article, called "The Fatigue Factor", is about fibromyalgia, and manages to get it wrong from the very beginning.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some medical reporting is destined to be bad simply because the topic is too complex for a generalist reporter.  But sometimes, a reporter succumbs to journalistic sloth.  In this story, for instance, if the reporter had spoken to a recognized local expert rather than a self-proclaimed expert, she would have written a much different article.&lt;/p&gt;

However, today the BBC published an interview with him in which the public pose the questions, and Pullman answers. At first, he seems to be as dull as suspected. Duller, even. His answers are terse and bored and patronising. But as I read on I realised that what seems to be the worst interview ever is actually genius. By the end, I was laughing out loud. I don’t know if he did it on purpose, and it doesn’t really matter. Pullman has gone up in my estimation. Here are the highlights of the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you ever expect His Dark Materials to become so popular, as well as such a controversial subject?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you still writing The Book of Dust? Can you give us a little more insight about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not yet. I never show anyone work in progress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you consider writing a story for Doctor Who’s time and space adventures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. I write the things I want to write, not things someone else asks me to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I just read The Broken Bridge and loved it! I was wondering, how do you write from the point of view of characters that are so different from you (half-Haitian teenage girl)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for your comment. I’m glad you enjoyed the story. As for how I wrote it, it’s a matter of imagination. You imagine what it would be like to be someone else, and then you write about it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last answer killed me. It’s like someone asking Phillip Seymour Hoffman how he went about playing the role of Truman Capote, and him replying “I pretended I was him”.&lt;/p&gt;

I almost bought it but I thought I might end up not liking it and was hesitant to spend the money on it so I selfishly used my clout as a Skepchick blogger and asked the author to have his publisher send me a review copy. About a week later, it showed up in my mailbox. I am not sure why I wanted to read this book. I’ve been conscientiously avoiding the books that could be considered “&lt;a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,3216,Two-new-fleas-are-discovered,RichardDawkinsnet"&gt;fleas&lt;/a&gt;” riding along on the back of the atheist bestsellers, but something about this book caught my interest. I guess it was that it claimed to be friendly, and that the author seriously seemed to want to have a dialog with unbelievers, rather than a debate. (As you may know from many of my previous posts, I absolutely despise debates and arguments and I think they are basically an annoying and unproductive a waste of time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up reading the entire book. I agreed with some parts of it, thought the author missed the point in other parts, but in general I was pleased to find that the book was congenial and interesting. I am not going to go over the book point by point to tell you which parts I disagreed with. You’ll have to read it yourself and come to your own conclusions. But I can say, that there are many interesting topics that could lead to fruitful discussions between believers and unbelievers, if we can refrain ourselves from trying to always be right and get points for making the other guy look stupid. I hope many of you will take the time to give this book a chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I’ve been sick lately, I’ve asked the author to write a guest post in lieu of having an interview. I hope you enjoy it and please feel free to pose any questions that come to mind in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And without further ado….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=139"&gt;A Friendly Letter to Skeptics and Atheists:  Musings on Why God is Good and Faith Isn’t Evil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by David G. Myers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can a skeptic believe in God?  Can an appreciative longtime subscriber to The Skeptical Inquirer and Skeptic magazines also be a theist?  Can someone who has written about the perils of &lt;a href="http://davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=19"&gt;unchecked intuition&lt;/a&gt;, and who begins his introductory psychology text with a chapter on “Thinking Critically with Psychological Science,” find meaning in religious faith?  Can someone whose skeptical website is Google’s first nonWikipedia result for “&lt;a href="http://www.davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=15"&gt;extrasensory perception&lt;/a&gt;” searches be spiritually engaged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I explain in this new little book, it’s possible, methinks, to transcend the skeptic/believer dichotomy.  That involves suggesting to people of faith a faith-based case for science and to skeptics the possibility of a reasonable, meaningful, and humane faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridging skepticism and faith requires, first, accepting many indictments of religion, which, especially in religion’s fundamentalist forms, is often associated with irrationality and evil.  And it requires embracing the religious spirit of humility, which acknowledges that we all have dignity but not deity, and therefore need to check our error-prone ideas against reality.  Thus, informed by science and by recent biblical scholarship, many people of faith have taken a new look at their former understandings of the soul, of intercessory prayer, and of sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I then seek to offer my skeptical friends the outlines of a progressive, biblically rooted, “ever-reforming” faith─a faith that is hopeful, science-affirming, and humane.  For example, in contrast to assertions that religion─all religions─are dangerous or even evil, the available evidence indicates that religiosity, on balance, is associated with happiness, helpfulness, and health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must tip the hat to Skepchick readers, who form a counter example to data I present in a little chapter on “The Skeptics Boys Club.”  Skepticism has generally been the province of the male and pale.  Authors of skeptical and new atheist books, 20th century skeptical heroes (as identified by the Skeptical Inquirer), and members of skeptical organizations are predominantly Euro-American White men.  If we were to judge from who is authoring New Age books, and from those who believe in God, worship, and pray, women and African Americans appear more open to spirituality and to nonrational forms of knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a male and pale rationalist myself, I often find myself cheering on the skeptical guys (and Skepchicks).  Indeed, I take pleasure in critically examining not only ESP but also near-death experiences, subliminal persuasion, astrology, alleged repressed and recovered memories, alternative medicine, and much more.  My point in that short chapter was simply to acknowledge that antireligious skepticism is predominantly a product of men expressing contempt for the beliefs of people whose thinking and culture differ from their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my larger aim in this book is to suggest to skeptical friends how someone might share their commitment to evidence and skepticism, while also embracing a faith that makes sense of the universe, gives meaning to life, connects us in supportive communities, mandates altruism, and offers hope in the face of adversity and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.davidmyers.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;David G. Myers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; professes psychology at Hope College.  His seventeen books include (with excerpts available online) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=19"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intuition:  Its Powers and Perils&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=23"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What God Has Joined Together:  The Christian Case for Gay Marriage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and, most recently, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidmyers.org/Brix?pageID=139"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Friendly Letter to Skeptics and Atheists:  Musings on Why God is Good and Faith Isn’t Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3699565/Muslim-lawyer-Anjem-Choudary-brands-Christmas-evil.html"&gt;one crazy lawyer, Anjem Choudary, is calling Christmas evil&lt;/a&gt;. How can we godless top that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very concept of Christmas contradicts and conflicts with the foundation of Islam. Every Muslim has a responsibility to protect his family from the misguidance of Christmas, because its observance will lead to hellfire. Protect your Paradise from being taken away - protect yourself and your family from Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Have no fear. We can say something much, much worse. Here's an &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3702157/Primary-school-teacher-tells-class-that-Father-Christmas-isnt-real.html"&gt;elementary school teacher who told her class that Santa wasn't real&lt;/a&gt;. The reaction from the parents is amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lad was nearly in tears and so was everyone else in the class - especially as it was so close to Christmas. I thought it was wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was distraught about it. He's only seven-years-old and it's part of the magic of Christmas to him.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We told him that she did not believe in Father Christmas because of her religion and he's fine now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found it shocking. She has done it maliciously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, seven years old … I wonder how many of them actually bought that Santa nonsense at all? Looks like some smart-aleck kids saw a ploy to disrupt class, make a teacher suffer, and get extra-special sympathy from their parents.&lt;/p&gt;

Something like that took place the last few days. A skeptic is preparing to debate David Wood on the resurrection so he emailed me and asked for my advice. I spent a great deal of time advising him. The original structure of his argument was bad. He was arguing for things that were non-essential. And the centerpiece of his argument was a lame one. While I agree with it, a Christian will not think it has the slightest bit of plausibility. He didn't like my advice and he did not express gratitude for the fact that I spent a lot of time dealing with him. What he wanted was a pat on the back--a yes man. Well, I am not a yes man. Anyone who reads this blog knows that. If he doesn't radically change his argument then David Wood will have an easy go of it. Hell, I'd even like to debate him. That's my opinion, and unless he changes it I'm stiking to it.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've also watched plenty of debates online between high profile skeptics and believers. Most of them do not get at the heart of what I consider to be the &lt;em&gt;Achilles' Heel&lt;/em&gt; of Christianity. Again, that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. Since it seems skeptics need some help in the area of debate, I want it known that I'm now throwing my hat into the ring. I want to begin debating Christians on topics related to the Christian faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will not debate obnoxious Christians who are disrespectful to me. I will only debate educated ones. I'd much prefer face to face debates in front of a live audience, not written ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I challenge them all. That's right, all of them, one at a time. Bring it on. Your place or mine (in Indiana). My guess is that most of them will not want to do it after reading through my book. If they bristle at such a suggestion then fine. Put up then. So that I might get their attention let me specify some of those Christians I challenge: I mean Richard Swinburne, William Lane Craig, J. P. Moreland, R. Douglass Geivett, Gary Habermas, Norman Geisler, Douglas Groothuis, James F. Sennett, Paul Copan, Mark Linville, Craig Evans, Greg Ganssle, Craig Bloomberg, Michael Rea, Greg Koukl, Gregory A. Boyd, Paul Rhodes Eddy, Richard G. Howe, Michael R. Licona, David Marshall, R.C. Sproul, Peter Kreeft, Frank Turek, Ronald K. Tacelli, Ravi K. Zacharias, Josh McDowell, Albert Mohler, Hank Hanegraaff, James White, Dinesh D'Souza, Lee Strobel, Timothy Keller, Mary Jo Sharp, Todd Friel, or David Wood, just to name a few, some of whom I consider friends of mine and others very good friends of mine. This is not anything personal with any of them at all. It's just my way of getting their attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a pretty bold challenge. But I mean it. This does not mean I think I know more than all of them. I don't, not by a long shot. Their collective wisdom is much greater than I could ever hope for. But when it comes to the over-all case against Christianity I will debate any and all of them one at a time for as long as it takes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------- &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you comment on this challenge, don't merely suggest that I should debate someone. Organize it and get back to me. Get sponsors, and so forth. If a Christian knows of someone they'd like me to debate then contact that person and tell them of me. Email this post of mine to anyone and everyone. I say to them all. I'm here. I'm willing. Let's have a go at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So, why math?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The short version of the answer is remarkably simple: math provides
a tool where you can, without ambiguity, prove that something is true or false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I'll get back to that - but first, I'm going to make a quick diversion, to help you understand my basic viewpoint on things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This blog actually started in response to something specific. I was reading
&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence"&gt;Orac's blog "Respectful Insolence"&lt;/a&gt;, and
he was fisking a study published by the Geiers, purporting to show a change in the trend in autism diagnoses. Orac was attacking it on multiple bases, but it struck me
that the most obvious problem with it was that it was, basically, a mathematical argument, but the math was blatantly wrong. It was making a classic statistical analysis mistake which is covered in first-year statistics courses. (And I mean
that very literally: when I was in college, I lazily satisfied some course requirements by taking a statistics course given by the Poly Sci department, and
in statistics for political scientists, they covered exactly the error made by the Geiers in November of the fall semester.) It struck me that while there were a lot of really great science bloggers - people like Orac, PZ Myers, Tara Smith, and so on - that I didn't know of anyone doing the same thing with math.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So I &lt;a href="http://goodmath.blogspot.com/2006/03/bad-math.html"&gt;started this blog on Blogger&lt;/a&gt;. And my goals for the blog have never changed. What
	I've wanted to do all along is:&lt;/p&gt;
	
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; To show people the beauty of math. Math is really wonderful. It's
		fun, it's beautiful, it's useful. But people are &lt;em&gt;taught&lt;/em&gt; from
		an early age that it's useless, hard, and miserable. I want to show
		otherwise, by describing the beauty of math in ways that are approachable
		and understandable by non-mathematicians.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; To help people recognize when someone is trying to put something past
		them by abusing math - what I call obfuscatory mathematics. Because so many people don't know math, hate it,
		think it's incomprehensible, that makes it easy for dishonest people
		to fool them. People throw together garbage in the context of a mathematical
		argument, and use it to lend credibility to their arguments. By pointing
		out the basic errors in these things, I try to help show people how to
		recognize when someone is try to use math to confuse them or trick them.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; To show people that they use and rely on math far more than they think.
		This relates back to the first point, but it's important enough to 
		justify its own discussion. Lots of people believe that they can't
		understand math, and avoid it like the plague. But at the same time, they're
		using it every day - they just don't know it. My favorite example
		of this is from my own family. My older brother had a string of truly horrible
		math teachers, and was convinced that he was horrible at math, couldn't
		understand it, couldn't do it. You couldn't even try to teach it to him,
		because he was so sure that he couldn't do it that he'd psych himself out
		before he even started. But he's a really smart guy. When he went to college,
		he studied music. I visited him at one point, and was watching him do an
		assignment for his music theory course, where they were studying something
		called serial composition. He was analyzing a musical score - and what
		he was doing to analyze it was taking determinants of matrices in mod-12 
		arithmetic! Of course, he didn't &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that that was what he was
		doing; instead of the numbers 0 through 11, he was using the notes of the
		musical scale. But it was taking a determinant, just using a different
		symbol set. He had no trouble doing that; but try to teach him to compute
		a percentage, and he'll insist not just that he can't do it, but that 
		he's &lt;em&gt;incapable of learning to do it.&lt;/em&gt; That kind of thing is
		all too common - people do math every day, without knowing it. If they
		understood whata they were doing, they might be open to learning more,
		to being able to do more themselves - but because they've been taught
		that they can't do it, they don't see that they do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This will come around back to my basic point; keep reading below the fold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/why_math.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/why_math.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/480923265" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228940415922"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6f202f4e672cf8cc</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">Copy Number Variants are not evidence of design</title><published>2008-12-10T19:07:41Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T19:07:41Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/480877954/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;div style="float:left;padding:5px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://researchblogging.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blogging on Peer-Reviewed Research" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/rb.png" width="120" height="90"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Creation Research has a charming little magazine called &amp;quot;Acts &amp;amp; Facts&amp;quot; that prints examples of their &amp;quot;research&amp;quot; — which usually means misreading some scientific paper and distorting it to make a fallacious case for a literal interpretation of the bible. Here&amp;#39;s a classic example: &lt;a href="http://www.icr.org/article/4273/"&gt;Chimps and People Show 'Architectural' Genetic Design&lt;/a&gt;, by Brian Thomas, M.S. (Note: this is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; the peer-reviewed research paper implied by the logo to the left — that comes later.) The paper is a weird gloss on recent work on CNVs, or copy number variants. Mr Thomas makes a standard creationist inference that I have to hold up for public ridicule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/copy_number_variants_are_not_e.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/480877954" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228939538428"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4600">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a1979d8220b8f983</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 12.10.08</title><published>2008-12-10T20:00:36Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T20:00:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4600" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=4f278303ec34c4603662c97a63533b8c&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pup.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pup-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="158" height="127"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having always had a pet in my life (that’s my pup to the right), I’ve often wondered about the cognitive and emotional abilities of animals. The prevailing wisdom has been that most of the anthropomorphic characteristics we see in our pets are projection. But my dog &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to love me, or at least be affectionate. And she understands that certain labels apply to certain actions. How can I really know the extent of what she feels and understands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPR discussed this issue yesterday in an article entitled &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97944783"&gt;Dogs Understand Fairness, Get Jealous, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;. The study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, studied the existence of jealousy in dogs by giving unequal rewards for the same behavior. The study found that dogs that were previously happy to perform tricks for mere praise, stopped cooperating when other dogs were given treats for the same behavior. Sulking, it would seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How “human-like” do you think the cognitive and emotional abilities of our pets are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s what the announcer said: “traffic,” as though we weren’t sitting on tracks underground in a closed system that should be relatively predictable seeing as it’s been running for the past hundred years or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my bag, I had two boredom-fighters: one was the newspaper I picked up yesterday but had no time to read, and the other was a book I began yesterday that I was nearly finished. I pulled out the paper and noticed the horoscope – I love reading yesterday’s horoscope, because it gives me that much more perspective on both what I did that day as well as the uselessness of astrology. Yesterday’s horoscope read simply, “Libra: Take control of your life.” I frightened the other passengers by literally laughing out loud, because the book that I had started yesterday and had been thinking about quite a bit was called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970818181?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=skepchick-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0970818181"&gt;The Myth of Free Will&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of essays edited by Cris Evatt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cris was kind enough to mail me her collection quite awhile ago, and I had flipped through it but didn’t get a good, in-depth read of it until yesterday. In short, I really enjoyed it. Great thinkers like Richard Dawkins, V. S. Ramachandran, and Sue Blackmore offer very brief thoughts on what free will is all about, and why it’s an illusion. It’s a subject I never gave much thought, and had you asked me last week whether or not I thought there was such a thing as free will I probably would have said I wasn’t sure. If you asked me today, I’d tell you that free will is more than likely one of the coolest, craziest illusions man experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essays themselves are ridiculously short and often repetitive, which I would probably cast as a criticism with any other subject. In the case of free will, though, it’s so weird and trippy that I appreciate the straightforward, easy-to-read style as an introduction to the topic. It leaves plenty of room for someone to pause and think, “Oh. Oh!” That will happen a lot, if this is your first foray into the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked about free will before on Skepchick: &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=364"&gt;Stacey gave a good overview of the subject nearly two years ago&lt;/a&gt;. I admit this is an area where I’ve been intellectually lazy, assuming that the question of free will was philosophical navel-gazing. I was so very wrong, and doubly wrong to only skim the comments that followed that initial essay, not only because they’re very well-written and thought-provoking, but mostly because &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=364#comment-4386"&gt;midway down I’ve just seen this&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blake Stacey&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You write so well and so cogently, I’m always left wondering why you don’t have your own blog for us all to read. Even a weekly update would be worthwhile! I’m certain that I’m not the only one who would love to see it, and since I encounter your comments on Pharyngula and BA as well, I’m sure you’d pull in a cross-section of regular readership from fans of yours at all three places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say that you should stop commenting elsewhere, of course…just that, you know, having one solid place for all of your insight would be a good thing &lt;img src="http://skepchick.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that Blake &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/sunclipse/"&gt;now has a very successful SciBlog&lt;/a&gt;, and considering that none of us has free will, I do believe this means that Expatria’s comment, which in and of itself was one of many effects created by the Skepchick blog as a whole, was one of an integral series of causes leading to the eventual effect of Blake’s brain creating the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s how lack of free will means that Blake owes us all Cokes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228937137591"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-7885666789152816004">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2b0550371358014d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Rationalism v Superstition" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Humor" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Hint</title><published>2008-12-10T19:12:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T19:23:39Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/hint.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/7885666789152816004/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=7885666789152816004" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> In my family we don&amp;#39;t give gifts at Christmas (but we do have a Christmas tree and we do celebrate the season).

I still think that’s likely to be the case, but there’s more to talk about on the topic now: &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/3687843/Jesus-was-born-in-June-astronomers-claim.html"&gt;an astronomer in Australia thinks he’s found the actual Star&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t a star, he says, but an incredibly close conjunction of the planets Venus and Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3097791623/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3170/3097791623_5f2c21ae3a_o.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you saw &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/01/venus-the-moon-and-jupiter/"&gt;the very close pass of the two planets&lt;/a&gt; on December 1, 2008, then you know how striking it was. What astronomer Dave Reneke found was that in 2 BC, Venus and Jupiter were so close together they would have appeared almost as a single object. That would have been quite spectacular, especially over the few days leading up to the event as the two planets crept closer in the sky. If he’s right, then it wouldn’t surprise me at all that this event would have caught everyone’s attention 2000 years ago, especially since they were more attuned to the night sky than we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s his assumptions about the event I find fault with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the team is correct, it would mean Jesus was a Gemini, not a Capricorn as previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian astronomer Dave Reneke used complex computer software to chart the exact positions of all celestial bodies and map the night sky as it would have appeared over the Holy Land more than 2,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It revealed a spectacular astronomical event around the time of Jesus’s birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Reneke says the wise men probably interpreted it as the sign they had been waiting for, and they followed the ’star’ to Christ’s birthplace in a stable in Bethlehem, as described in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem with this is the leap of logic from The Star being a real event to it actually signaling the birth of Jesus. Basically, if this is being reported correctly, he is still relying on the account in the Bible being literal. There’s still no indication of this; the conjunction could have been real, but that does not mean it had anything to do with Jesus’ birth. As we know, people see signs all the time, and will conflate two different events given the chance. There’s no indication anywhere outside the Bible story that the Wise Men really existed, or made their journey, or saw The Star. We also know that the Bible has been re-interpreted, re-written, and retranslated many times over the years, so it seems very likely to me that the Wise Men story is just that: a story, and the conjunction gives it a nice ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying any of this didn’t happen. I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; saying that we still have no proof, but the article states all this as a matter of fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reneke goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not an attempt to decry religion. It’s really backing it up as it shows there really was a bright object appearing in the East at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree; it’s not backing up religion, it’s giving evidence that &lt;em&gt;one part&lt;/em&gt; of a Bible story may actually have occurred. Anything else is speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article goes even further, saying that this means Jesus was born in June (when the conjunction occurred), not December. Again, this is stated as fact without any real evidence linking the event to the birth of Jesus. The thing is, the reason Christmas is celebrated in December is not clear. There’s nothing in the Bible indicating the actual date (and some evidence in the Bible against it being in December; the Bible says shepherds were tending their sheep at night, which was unlikely during the winter). There are lots of theories, including early Christians usurping a pagan holiday (there is evidence for and against that idea; but decorating trees, for example, didn’t start until centuries later) that occurred at the winter solstice. So it’s certainly possible that Jesus was not born in December, but it’s still a pretty big assumption that this conjunction was tied to the actual date of the birth of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, I will admit to an error on my part. In my other article on this (linked above), I made a point about not being able to follow a star in the sky for any length of time because stars rise and set. However, for a conjunction of Venus and Jupiter to be easily seen, it has to happen near the eastern or western horizon; Venus never gets far from the Sun, so you can only easily see it after sunset (in the west) or before sunrise (in the east). So if the Wise Men story is true, and they saw the conjunction before sunrise in the east, then they could &amp;quot;follow&amp;quot; it, knowing they had to travel east. During the day they couldn’t see it, but they would have known that was the right direction to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still and all, I think this is a solution looking for a problem. Like a lot of other Bible stories, I think this is a pretty tale that has some basis in reality, but is probably not true in detail (like Noah’s Ark, Job’s travails, Sodom and Gomorrah, and so on). The astronomical evidence is interesting, but interpreting it should be done with a &lt;del&gt;pillar&lt;/del&gt; grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

Not surprisingly, responses have pointed out that the gaps are getting smaller and smaller and that a lot is known about how phototransduction may have arisen from precursors in other systems through duplication, co-option, and the various processes discussed in &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/t125078h5p201442/?p=4ff4ba2122cb4ab49df0058812c084de&amp;amp;pi=3"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think this debate misses a much larger and more significant point.  Darwin suggested that eyes evolved in the &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;, published 150 years ago.  This was before even the basics of heredity were generally understood.  It was before the discovery of DNA.  Before the elucidation of the structure of DNA.  Before the rise of molecular biology.  Before the advent of phylogenetics.  Before evolutionary developmental biology.  Before genome sequencing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, through the emergence of all these major new sources of data, not a single reliable observation in any of these fields has contradicted the general hypothesis that eyes are the product of evolutionary mechanisms.  Quite the opposite, as the picture of how this probably occurred in different lineages is become increasingly clear thanks in large part to this rapidly expanding body of knowledge.  Gaps remain, of course, which is why it's an intriguing field of inquiry.  But the notion of waiting until every last detail is known before accepting the basic historical reality badly misinterprets the nature of science and scientific evidence.&lt;img src="http://feeds2.feedburner.com/~r/Genomicron/~4/icsna2y-pFE" height="1" width="1"&gt;</content><author><name>T Ryan Gregory</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/Genomicron</id><title type="html">Genomicron</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228932354723"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-37148773.post-2938752387966636032">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/28d3fb678e6b4e79</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Biology" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">This Doesn't Seem Right ...</title><published>2008-12-10T17:53:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T18:01:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2008/12/this-doesnt-seem-right.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/feeds/2938752387966636032/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=37148773&amp;postID=2938752387966636032" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/" type="html"> Scientific American is reporting on a growing trend among field biologists.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The things people around the globe have in common are a strong interest in socialising and politics, according to Marissa Mayer, vice president of search at Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Social networks compromised four out of the top ten global fastest-rising queries while the US election held everyone's interest around the globe," she wrote on Google's official blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked back on the &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/global-zeitgeist.html"&gt;Google Blog&lt;/a&gt; and what Mayer wrote was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social networks comprised four out of the top 10 global fastest-rising  queries, while the U.S. election held everyone's interest around the  globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the BBC editors, besides changing &lt;em&gt;10&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; and removing the comma before &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt;, apparently also changed &lt;em&gt;comprised&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;compromised&lt;/em&gt;. A fascinating &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=386"&gt;miscorrection&lt;/a&gt; (or incorrection, if you prefer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's always possible that the Google Blog entry originally had &lt;em&gt;compromised&lt;/em&gt; but then was later fixed to read &lt;em&gt;comprised&lt;/em&gt;. That doesn't seem likely, however, since only the Beeb appears to have used the &lt;em&gt;compromised&lt;/em&gt; wording in quoting Mayer. And of course, even if it were in the original post, the BBC editors should have caught the miswording and [sic]ed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not seem to be a spellchecker-induced &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino_effect"&gt;Cupertino&lt;/a&gt;, since it's hard to imagine a spellchecker dictionary that includes &lt;em&gt;compromised&lt;/em&gt; but not &lt;em&gt;comprised&lt;/em&gt;. Instead I'm guessing it's an entirely human miscorrection, wherein &lt;em&gt;comprised&lt;/em&gt; somehow looks "wrong" to the editor and is changed to &lt;em&gt;compromised&lt;/em&gt; despite not making sense in context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when spelled correctly, Mayer's usage wouldn't satisfy a lot of prescriptivists. As the American Heritage &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/72/C0537200.html"&gt;usage note&lt;/a&gt; explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional rule states that the whole &lt;em&gt;comprises&lt;/em&gt; the parts and the parts &lt;em&gt;compose&lt;/em&gt; the whole. In strict usage: &lt;em&gt;The Union comprises 50 states. Fifty states compose&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;constitute&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;make up) the Union.&lt;/em&gt; Even though careful writers often maintain this distinction, &lt;em&gt;comprise&lt;/em&gt; is increasingly used in place of &lt;em&gt;compose,&lt;/em&gt; especially in the passive: &lt;em&gt;The Union is comprised of 50 states.&lt;/em&gt; Our surveys show that opposition to this usage is abating. In the  1960s, 53 percent of the Usage Panel found this usage unacceptable; in  1996, only 35 percent objected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to &lt;em&gt;comprised/compromised&lt;/em&gt;. Google turns up many similar substitutions, such as  when "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=is-compromised-of"&gt;is compromised of&lt;/a&gt;" appears where "is comprised of" is intended (again, using the prescriptively scorned sense). The substitution is so common that it even shows up in numerous edited books and journals on &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=is-compromised-of"&gt;Google Book Search&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Category 5 &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; two types. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=A8TPF_O385AC&amp;amp;pg=PA611&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Human-Computer Interaction Handbook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; various system level components deployed at various locations within a target network. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UMHAYcvH2x0C&amp;amp;pg=PA285&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Computer Security - Esorics 2005&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As discussed in detail in Chapter 2, the formula &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; three basic elements. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ty09vH7VZfAC&amp;amp;pg=PA6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tongues of the Fathers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than two thirds of this list &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; patients awaiting renal   transplantation. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9d6hwYiCfV4C&amp;amp;pg=PA54&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Living Donor Organ Transplantation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her tattoo art &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; black ink and shading work only. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vtCC1GUtX_IC&amp;amp;pg=PA96&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Body: Jewish Choices, Jewish Voices&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the underlying items &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; both forward and backward traces. (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UiRvY5MqKfwC&amp;amp;pg=PA145&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;The Psychology of Learning and Motivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information Lifecycle Management &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; the policies, processes, practices, and tools used to align the business value of information with the most appropriate and cost effective IT infrastructure. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ybzS-yylJfAC&amp;amp;pg=PA531&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emerging Trends and Challenges in Information Technology Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This body &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; delegates representing theological colleges in the various states of Australia. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1L2tvl0SK-gC&amp;amp;pg=PA28&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theological Reflection and Education for Ministry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sociodemographic profile of the individual &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; their age, sex and socioeconomic status. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=S7IFohMmAHcC&amp;amp;pg=PA29&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Urban Dynamics and Spatial Choice Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significantly, membership &lt;strong&gt;is compromised of&lt;/strong&gt; senior staff including the international students' counsellor, teachers of English as second language and senior staff. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9Jo3jigvmykC&amp;amp;pg=PA44&amp;amp;dq=is-compromised-of"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worlds of Learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on and so forth. Any thoughts on why this substitution is so commonplace? Is a malapropism giving way to a new sense of &lt;em&gt;compromise&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update, 1 pm EST: BBC News has already changed it back to &lt;em&gt;comprised&lt;/em&gt; in their &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7775344.stm"&gt;online article&lt;/a&gt;.

In a Morning Edition interview on NPR today Rob Chametzky heard Condoleezza Rice saying, "To mention Robert Mugabe in the same sentence with the President of the United States is an outrage."  No it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ruin a whole country that used to be prosperous, and plunder its remaining resources and steal its elections and beat and kill political opponents to keep your corrupt ass in power even as your starving people face epidemics, &lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt; is an outrage.  Mentioning the President of the United States in the same sentence with the name of a corrupt old tyrant who will soon be an ex-tyrant is not an outrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, as Jeff Burkholder first pointed out to me, there never was a sentence with both names in it.  This is unusually weird.  Here's the relevant part of the interview (thanks to Jonathan Lundell):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="000088"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interviewer:&lt;/b&gt; A lot of this — Guantanamo, all these issues — you start hearing from people, bad actors in the world, people like Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, he brings up these issues at the United Nations General Assembly floor. And I wonder if you think some of this made it more difficult for you as the secretary of state to talk about human rights.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="000088"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Rice:&lt;/b&gt;No, of course not. Robert Mugabe — to mention Robert Mugabe in the same sentence with the president of the United States is an outrage. And Robert Mugabe is simply trying to cover the fact that he&amp;#39;s taken a country, which was once one of the jewels of Africa, made it into a center of starvation and now of rampant disease that threatens its neighbors. And no, we shouldn&amp;#39;t fall prey to any kind of moral relativism here. We ought to call it as we see it.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we take the linguification at face value, Dr Rice was protesting about something that had not happened.  Further evidence that what is developing here is a kind of meta-cliché.  Dr. Rice was picking up on the suggestion that perhaps a Secretary of State who represents a nation run by George W. Bush is not as well placed to criticize the evil old wrecker of Zimbabwe as a representative of a nation run by someone better respected and liked overseas; and of course she bristles at the implied juxtaposition.  Linguification is a sort of depiction of moral or other analogical juxtaposition in terms of linguistic juxtaposition.  &amp;quot;In the same sentence with&amp;quot; is used as a surrogate for &amp;quot;in the same league with&amp;quot; or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that linguification is a dysfunctional device, and it irritates me; but past experience has shown that not many people agree with me on that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am naturally disappointed about this lack of fawning subservience to my every preference and whim.  And in order to dull the hurt of seeing that people do not share my peeve, I find it helps to keep comments closed.  So comments are closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's your own fault.  If only you agreed with me I would let you comment.  You have done this to yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't call me unfair.  Don't even mention my name in the same sentence with that adjective.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Geoffrey K.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/chickenghost.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source is the &lt;a href="http://www.savagechickens.com/2005/12/christmas-carol.html"&gt;Savage Chickens cartoon for 12/21/2005&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of the commenters on the cartoon points out, it would help to make the sentence unambiguously passive if "by" were substituted for "with", since "He is disappointed with his life" might just involve the copular verb "is" followed by the adjective "disappointed".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same commenter suggested that The Ghost of Future Perfect Progressive Passive might announce itself by saying  “Ebenezer! When I come again, you will have been being disappointed for quite some time by all the wrong choices you have made in your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as several people noted in commenting on "&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=897"&gt;What's will?&lt;/a&gt;", phrases like "you will have been being disappointed" are present in English only in a somewhat ethereal form.  Checking the first 10 pages of Google hits for "will have been being", I found only grammatical examples and (grammatical) jokes.  A search in Literature Online finds no hits at all, suggesting that the four-word sequence "will have been being" has never been used in the 350,000 works of English-language poetry and prose indexed there. And similarly, a search in the Proquest Historical Newspaper archive comes up empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that this four-word auxiliary sequence has never been used in earnest, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that most English speakers have never encountered an example. If so, that means that the grammaticality of these phrases (and I'm personally convinced that they're in some sense part of the language) is implicit in the patterns that people do often encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In order to encourage the empirical impulse among our readers, the first person who finds and documents a genuine, real-world use of "will have been being" will receive a free lifetime subscription to Language Log. ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[And again, just to keep things straight — &amp;quot;will have been disappointed&amp;quot;, as used in this cartoon, certainly expresses a prediction about future time (a semantic notion), but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s in the future tense (a morpho-syntactic notion).]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228926510507"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/10/track-the-shuttles-return-to-florida-in-real-time/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/7f9790e2f8aaf1fd</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="NASA"/><title type="html">Track the Shuttle’s return to Florida in real time</title><published>2008-12-10T16:24:54Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T16:24:54Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/10/track-the-shuttles-return-to-florida-in-real-time/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;BABloggee Ryan Wilhelm tipped me off to &lt;a href="http://flightaware.com/live/flight/NASA911"&gt;a website which tracks the Space Shuttle Endeavour’s return flight to Florida from California&lt;/a&gt;, where it landed a few days ago.

&lt;p&gt;Oh, boy — get out the model airplane glue and little bottles of paint: &lt;a href="http://www.hobbymasters.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&amp;amp;ProdID=10972"&gt;you can build a model of Noah's Ark&lt;/a&gt;! And it's &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; $74! (The price of plastic models has sure gone up since I used to buy them with my lawn mowing money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This injection molded plastic model kit measures over 18 1/2" long and includes 3 separate interior decks with embossed wood texture and many details including ramps and animal cages and corrals. The kit offers several building options.  Modelers may display the Ark in cross section to reveal the internal decks or in the full-hull version.  Additional building options include: constructing the Ark with or without the deck cabin and a choice to include the "moon pool" (an open center well allowing access to water and waste disposal). This deluxe kit also includes a figure of Noah and 8 pairs of animals!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cute. Check out these details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Museum-quality replica&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Highly detailed tooling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Accurately scaled to the cubit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait…what kind of museum would show this silly thing? Can we also get a museum-quality replica of, say, the Millennium Falcon?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this talk of detail and accuracy bugs me. Here are the complete, total, unedited specifications for Noah's Ark, straight from the book of Genesis. This is really all it says about it; it isn't as if it even includes photos or movies or piles of glurge from George Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where's the moon pool, the cabin, the details? All we know is that it will fit within a 300x50x30 cubit box (and cubits are very sloppily defined), and it has one window and one door on the side. It seems to leave a lot of room for interpretation. In fact, this seems like an opportunity for some &lt;a href="http://www.automedia.com/The_Original_Rat_Fink/pht20060901er/1"&gt;Big Daddy Roth&lt;/a&gt;-style customization — it really needs a big &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dGAcUTBWd3EC&amp;amp;dq=big+daddy+roth+hot+rod+models+rat+fink&amp;amp;pg=PP1&amp;amp;ots=tTMcnLao47&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;sig=2r1-CCGqzVbRlSkUIv93-lUwYeE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=8&amp;amp;ct=result#PPA12,M1"&gt;rat fink&lt;/a&gt; mounted on the prow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The venerable Hubble telescope has found carbon dioxide on an extra-solar planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you may be thinking…”Wow, that means that Hubble may have found evidence for life since life can create carbon dioxide…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no. The planet in question, HD 189733b, is jupiter sized and far too hot for life as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the link to see an artist’s conception of this planet orbiting its parent star. It’s probably very different in reality but the drawing is very pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.theness.com/images/blogimages/c02planet.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="225"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if this planet is too hot for life, what’s the big deal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big deal is that this is proof that the biomarkers for life can be detected in the atmospheres of extra-solar planets. This Hubble experiment was always just a proof-of-concept and it was a resounding success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we’ll know what to look for when we observe earth-sized planets. Finding C02 and other biomarkers on such a planet could mean that life exists on that planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In the grammar text we are perusing, the concept of modals has  raised its head.  The words &amp;quot;The nice thing about modern grammarians is  that they have reduced the number of TENSES in English to just two,  PRESENT and PAST.  Notice even WILL (formerly considered to represent  the future tense) is really a PRESENT TENSE MODAL expressing present  time intent or will…..)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The class and I are  perplexed.  How wide-spread is this thinking?  Can you explain this,  particularly the WHY this change came about, and let us know how widely  accepted this concept is?  It has not  crept into most grammar books that kids use.  I told them that I would  ask a linguist about this since my linguistic studies are in a distant  past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me try to give a short answer to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's convenient to talk about past, present, and future time, and it's convenient to call the commonly-associated English verb forms past, present, and future tense: "we liked it; we like it; we'll like it." But when you look more carefully at  the whole pattern of possibilities for English tensed verbs, I think that you (and your class) will see the force of the argument that English doesn't really have a future tense form, even though it has many ways to express a future-time meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it's true that a common way to express a future-time meaning is indeed to use the auxiliary verb &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — but from a syntactic point of view, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;is used in the same way as the class of words generally called "modal auxiliaries", such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a closer look at the meanings of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that it doesn't really express future time, but rather has the same sort of relationship to time-meanings that (for example) &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  terminology remains variable, but at least since &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Jespersen"&gt;Otto Jespersen&lt;/a&gt; a hundred years ago, many grammarians working on English have  taken all this to mean that English has only two basic tenses, present and past. (Well, Jespersen called the past tense by the old-fashioned name &amp;quot;preterit&amp;quot; — but as I said, the terminology varies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, for those of you who are still with me, let's go on to a longer answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what does it mean to say that &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; has the syntactic distribution of  a  modal auxiliary? Consider this paradigm of 16 singular finite (i.e. tensed) auxiliary+verb forms in standard contemporary English, taken from p. 105 of the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"&gt;Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="text-align:center" border="1"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Modal &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Perfect &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Progressive &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Passive &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Lexical Verb &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;takes&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;is&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;taken&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;is&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;taking&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;is&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;being&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the column labelled "Modal", you can replace &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, etc., and get good standard-English auxiliary+verb forms.  But that's the only place in the paradigm where &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — or the rest of these words — can fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; shares a number of other properties with its fellow modal auxiliaries. Here are three of the five shared properties, in my paraphrase of the explanation given in CGEL on pp. 106-107.   (Explaining the other two would be a distraction at this stage.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;(a) Modal auxiliaries take only primary forms. For example, they have no &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; form, and you can't precede them with the infinitive marker &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  To see this, let's contrast the modal auxiliary &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with the phrase of similar meaning "be able to"; and the modal auxiliary &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; with "be about to". Thus you can say "I regret not being able to leave" but not "I regret not canning leave"; and similarly "I regret not being about to leave", but not "I regret not willing leave". Likewise "I want to be about to leave" works, but "I want to will leave" doesn't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;(b) Modal auxiliaries don't show person-number agreement: "I am about to do it" vs. "We are about to do it"; but "I will do it" vs. "We will do it".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;(c) Modal auxiliaries take bare infinitival complements (i.e. without "to"): "We can leave; we will leave", not "we can to leave; we will to leave", compared to "We want to leave; we ought to leave; we are about to leave".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are these words called "modals"? In a tradition going back to Aristotle, &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/"&gt;modal logic&lt;/a&gt; deals with ways of qualifying the truth of a judgment. In its modern form, modal logic might deal with the logic of necessity and possibility, or the logic of obligation and permission, or the logic of belief, or the logic of time. And since the words like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;would&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are verbal auxiliaries that mostly express modal concepts, it makes sense to call them "modal auxiliaries".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the argument that the core meaning of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is not really "future"? As CGEL explains (pp. 209-210):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;The difference in interpretation between a simple present tense and its counterpart with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is to a very large extent a matter of modality. Compare, for example:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style="text-align:left" border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Present Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Future Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; That is the doctor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; They meet in the final in May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;plain form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; That will be the doctor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; They will meet in the final in May.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In each pair the time is the same, but the version with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is epistemically weaker [i.e. less certain] than the simple present. Note also that all of the auxiliaries in question can be used with situation that are in part, present, or future time. Compare &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Past Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Present Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Future Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;He will have left already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; He will be in Paris now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; He will see her tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;He may have left already.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; He may be in Paris now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; He may see her tomorrow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more reflective and extensive discussion, I recommend an earlier Language Log post ("&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005471.html"&gt;The Lord which was and is&lt;/a&gt;", 3/18/2008) by Geoff Pullum, co-author of CGEL. For a fanciful speculation about why all the modern Germanic languages have  lost the future tense category that Spanish, French and other Indo-European languages have retained, see David Beaver's "&lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000521.html"&gt;There's no future in canoeing&lt;/a&gt;", 3/2/2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you  want to follow an experienced guide deep into the grammatical woods, take a look at Anoop Sarkar, "&lt;a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/papers/pdf/pwpl-final.pdf"&gt;The conflict between future tense and modality: The case of &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;in English&lt;/a&gt;", &lt;em&gt;Penn Working Papers in Linguistics&lt;/em&gt; 5(2):  91-117, 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anoop's conclusion? English &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;is a present-tense modal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the original question, let me add that it's easy to see why the quoted passage would puzzle an intelligent, informed and curious teacher. (And why it would positively baffle a class full of intellectually engaged seventh graders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place, &amp;quot;modern grammarians&amp;quot; haven&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;reduced the number of tenses in English to just two&amp;quot; — rather, they&amp;#39;ve argued that English has had only two tenses all along, going back to the time before it was even called &amp;quot;English&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second place, the change has nothing to do with the fact that modern grammarians are nice (though &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001808.html"&gt;they are&lt;/a&gt;) — rather, it&amp;#39;s motivated by a logical argument based on the facts of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third place, it seems wrong to claim that the present-day meaning of will is "present-time intent". Originally, it mean "to want" or "to wish" or "to choose", and one of its uses in English historically was to express "present-time intent". But this sense is largely obsolete today, except in a few constructions and expressions.  CGEL suggests that the kind of modality involved is "epistemic", i.e. having to do with knowledge or degree of acceptance; and in the &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005471.html"&gt;cited LL post&lt;/a&gt;, Geoff Pullum attributes to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (with examples) "a wide range of meanings, ranging over volition, inclination, habituation, tendency, inference, and prediction".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a text for middle-schoolers shouldn't just appeal to the authority of "modern grammarians", whatever their motivation, especially when it suggests that they've changed their minds about something. It's not hard to give some arguments for the view that English has no future tense, as I've done above. The arguments might be right or wrong, and students should be free to engage them seriously and come to a conclusion. This is not because they're better qualified than the experts, but because it's the only way for them to understand the claims.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228918640955"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/facepalm_thy_name_is_dr_egnor.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5420d7ff4559ffef</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">Facepalm, thy name is Dr. Egnor!

&lt;img alt="facepalm.jpg" src="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/facepalm.jpg" width="400" height="320"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to wonder if the most famous denizen of the Discovery Institute in medical circles, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=egnor&amp;amp;sa.x=6&amp;amp;sa.y=8&amp;amp;sa=search"&gt;Dr. Michael Egnor&lt;/a&gt;, is on vacation or something. For some reason, he's been especially active over at the Discovery Institute's repository of pseudoscience, &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Evolution News &amp;amp; Views&lt;/a&gt;, over the last couple of weeks. Neurosurgeons tend to be very busy people, more so even than a humble breast cancer surgeon like me, and few are as motivated as I am to blog. Yet, these days Dr. Egnor&amp;#39;s been flooding EN&amp;amp;V with more of his blather than I&amp;#39;ve seen him do in a long time, maybe ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's times like these that I can't help but ask him if he doesn't happen to have a few brains to operate on instead of embarrassing the fine profession of surgery for me among all the basic scientists with whom I have to interact. After all, everybody's favorite obtusely creationist neurosurgeon, whom I once called the "&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/the_energizer_bunny_of_antievolution_1.php"&gt;Energizer Bunny of antievolution&lt;/a&gt;," is arguably one of the biggest embarrassments to me as a surgeon that I have yet encountered. The man is a bottomless pit of evolution denial; worse, he is unrelenting in his perseveration of repeating the same tired old "intelligent design" creationism canards over and over again and, as &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/12/dr_michael_egnor_neurosurgeon.php"&gt;Mike Dunford&lt;/a&gt; documents, either utterly clueless or even possibly dishonest in the way he selects what he will quote from posts by those whom he is trying to refute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, this flurry seemed to start around the time I posted &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/11/wheres_that_doctor_doom_mask_again.php"&gt;this exasperated plea&lt;/a&gt; for a mask to cover my face because of this &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/11/is_pz_myers_attending_a_confer.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;post by Dr. Egnor&lt;/a&gt;. What I had failed to notice is that Dr. Egnor actually &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/11/darwinian_medicine_and_militar.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;replied to me&lt;/a&gt; and went off on one of his usual tangents that did nothing more than hammer home his ignorance of evolutionary theory. Oddly enough (or perhaps not surprisingly), I didn&amp;#39;t even notice that he responded, which at least reassures me that EN&amp;amp;V isn&amp;#39;t a particularly highly trafficked site if its incoming signal gets totally lost in the noise of my stats. Mike Dunford, fortunately, took up my slack and leapt into the breach to shoot down Dr. Egnor&amp;#39;s nonsense, &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/11/egnor_shoots_he_scores.php"&gt;pointing out that&lt;/a&gt;, if anything, Dr. Egnor had actually unintentionally made a good argument for the validity of evolution as applied to medicine. Given that Mike did such a good job of demolishing Dr. Egnor's misinterpretation of science, I don't see a compelling need to pile on, especially not when Dr. Egnor provides such a--shall we say?--target-rich environment, for instance, &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/12/who_would_connect_the_legacy_o.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; referring to P.

This is not exactly what we meant, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2008/dec/06/do-you-see-the-virgin-mary-in-this-brain-scan/"&gt;Pamela Latrimore&lt;/a&gt; believes that an aparition of the Virgin Mary has appeared on an MRI scan of her brain.  She also hopes that others might believe this, as she is selling her scan on Ebay to raise money for her medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a particularly impressive example of pareidolia. Mary sightings are common, perhaps, because it is relatively easy to provoke pareidolia for this type of image. All that is needed is a downward curve that can look like a hooded bent head. Sometimes there is a face present, sometimes not. In this case there are some dots that the brain can fit into a very crude face. It doesn’t take much for our visual processing cortex to match a pattern to something recognizable. Picaso was evidence of this - he could evoke the impression of human figure with a single curved line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also note that this MRI scan is upside down. That may not be apparent to someone not used to looking at them, but it struck me immediately.  The image is cropped so you can only see a bit of the writing around the image (which typically contains information about the patient and technical information about the scan), but I think you can tell from this that the writing is upside down. This is convention, of course - there is no objective up or down for these coronal views, sliced through the head horizontally. But the option of looking at the scan right-side-up or up-side-down doubles the chance for pareidolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of one day as a student when I got a little bored looking at slides of microscopic sections of various organs. These slides are filled with random shapes and squiggles - a cornucopia of pareidolia. I became distracted looking for faces and other familiar shapes in the histology of the liver and pancreas. It was not difficult. Later I attended a lecture of a pathologist who had collected slides over the years of interesting microscopic pareidolia. My memory of this is now faded. I could not find anything like it with a quick search on Google. If anyone knows of something like this let me know in the comments, it would be good to link to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thought - I wonder how far knowledge of pareidolia has penetrated into the broader culture. I would think the internet would have increased this substantially.  There doesn’t seem to be any shortage of new cases of gullible pareidolia, however. Sounds like a question ripe for a survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, what came to mind was her movie of earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0871426/"&gt;Baby Mama&lt;/a&gt;, whose title was one of assorted indications of late that &lt;em&gt;baby mama&lt;/em&gt;, the black American inner-city term referring to a woman one has had children with but is not married to, has become mainstream. Further evidence was when Fox News used the term in a teaser graphic last summer in reference to Michelle Obama ("Outraged liberals: stop picking on Obama’s baby mama").  Graceless, but in its assumption that viewers were familiar with the term, indicative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunt up the derivation of the term these days and even the &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2141083/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;OED&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has fallen for a tasty but mistaken idea that the source is Jamaican Creole (&amp;quot;patois&amp;quot;), in which there is a term &amp;quot;baby-mother&amp;quot;. However, the chance that a random locution from Jamaican Creole becomes common coin across all of black America is small—a fluent speaker of Black English could go several years without uttering a single word born in Jamaican Creole. Plus, usually the Jamaican term doesn’t really mean what &lt;em&gt;baby mama&lt;/em&gt; does, referring more generally to a pregnant woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This derivation is based on a general misconception that language is just words, rather than grammar. &lt;em&gt;Baby mama&lt;/em&gt; is not just an &amp;quot;idiom&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;expression&amp;quot; — it is a predictable manifestation of a general grammatical rule of Black English different from the equivalent one in Standard English. Namely, the possessive &lt;em&gt;’s&lt;/em&gt; is often not present in Black English—not just between the words &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mama&lt;/em&gt;, nor between those and &lt;em&gt;baby&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;daddy&lt;/em&gt; as well (&lt;em&gt;baby daddy&lt;/em&gt; is also a set expression), but between any two words in a possessive relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to people speaking the dialect the next time you're in line, on a subway, or watching a black film and you'll catch it. Lisa Green in her &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/African-American-English-Linguistic-Introduction/dp/0521891388/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1228894073&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;grammar of Black English&lt;/a&gt; gives the basics, with sentences like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;i&gt;Sometime Rolanda bed don't be made up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;That's the church responsibility.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I myself recall hearing someone at a fast food restaurant saying &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s Brenda drink, not his&amp;quot; and in a barbershop &amp;quot;Melvin can do what he please — today Melvin day!&amp;quot; (instead of &lt;i&gt;Melvin's day&lt;/i&gt;). None of this has anything to do with Jamaica: it's a structural trait of the grammar of Black English right here at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, while the folk history of the term currently highlights the rappers Outkast's 2000 hit "Ms. Jackson" as helping imprint it with its dedication to "all the baby mamas' mamas", black America was regaled with an example of the grammatical construction way back in the eighties and early nineties when the late, great Robin Harris was doing comedy routines about the notoriously naughty brood "Bebe's kids" (enshrined in a lovely and undersung &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103783/"&gt;cartoon film&lt;/a&gt;) with Harris&amp;#39;s catchphrase &amp;quot;Dem Bebe kids!!!!&amp;quot;  Again, Harris was not aping Jamaican patois — he was using the grammar of his American home dialect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to Joe Louis.  In the film, he says "All I know is I'm in Uncle Sam's army and we are on God's side." Or at least that's what the script had, and how the line has been quoted in print. But the way Louis, a native speaker of Ebonics one part Alabama and one part Detroit, actually rendered the line was, in fluent Ebonics style, "All I know is I'm in Uncle Sam army."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: &lt;em&gt;baby mama&lt;/em&gt; is not just "an expression" in which the absence of the possessive &lt;em&gt;’s&lt;/em&gt; motivates a comparison to Jamaican Creole or anything else that emerged beyond where Black English itself did. It is an instantiation of one general grammatical rule out of a great many that makes Black English an alternate &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; that its speakers command alongside standard English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom is that standard varieties have &amp;quot;grammar&amp;quot; while vernacular varieties have merely &amp;quot;slang&amp;quot;.  But Joe Louis on a soundstage in 1943, dutifully mouthing a carefully memorized written line, used a grammatical feature of his home dialect. He would have been perplexed — rightly — to be told that he was channeling calypso.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>John McWhorter</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228894895650"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c5109209d060c8e4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">How Big Is Wal-Mart?</title><published>2008-12-10T15:00:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T15:00:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/bigwalmart.asp" type="text/html"/><summary xml:base="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="html">Statistics about the size of the Wal-Mart chain of retail stores.</summary><author><name>snopes@snopes.com</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.rss</id><title type="html">New Urban Legends</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.snopes.com/info/whatsnew.asp" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228882253914"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/h_influenzaeit_aint_the_flu_bu.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fde83ad0857ddeb5</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Medicine"/><title type="html">H. influenzae---it ain't the flu, but it's still pretty cool</title><published>2008-12-10T03:42:27Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T03:42:27Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~3/480174739/h_influenzaeit_aint_the_flu_bu.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/h_influenzaeit_aint_the_flu_bu.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was first posted at &lt;a href="http://sciencebasedmedicine.com"&gt;Science-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, but I can't seem to keep myself from cross-posting.  --PalMD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I've been thinking about an interesting organism lately, an organism that illustrates some basic principles in science-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organism is called Haemophilus influenzae (H flu), a gram-negative bacterium discovered in the late 19th century. H flu has a great story, both in historic and modern times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brilliant microbiologist Richard Pfeiffer isolated H flu from influenza patients in the late 1800's (hence its name) and for many years, it was believed to be the cause of the epidemic illness, and when the flu pandemic of 1918 hit, researchers worked tirelessly to develop anti-sera against H flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some things weren't adding up. As thousands died of the flu, doctors were isolating H flu from victims, but also other virulent bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Influenza was decimating military camps, and was seriously degrading our ability to fight in WW I, so military bases were a focus of research. Doctors looked for H flu in patients, but could not find it consistently. For example in Camp Dodge, Iowa, an autopsy series showed H flu in only 9.6% of victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some researchers were focusing on something else. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/h_influenzaeit_aint_the_flu_bu.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/h_influenzaeit_aint_the_flu_bu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/480174739" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228878559493"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25805659.post-6617037589996470831">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/23ecc4da6e299292</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="syndicated"/><title type="html">Academic Quackometrics</title><published>2008-12-09T22:46:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-09T22:46:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2008/12/academic-quackometrics.html" type="text/html"/><author><name>Le Canard Noir</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.badscienceblogs.net/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">badscienceblogs</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.badscienceblogs.net" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228871364256"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/targetrich_polling_environment.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/019af60c1d41f338</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Pointless polls"/><title type="html">Target-rich polling environment</title><published>2008-12-10T00:29:01Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T00:29:01Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/480059737/targetrich_polling_environment.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/targetrich_polling_environment.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;AOL is running &lt;a title=" Bush Says He Doubts Bible Literally True" href="http://news.aol.com/article/bush-says-he-doubts-bible-literally-true/264531"&gt;several polls on Bush's recent statements&lt;/a&gt; — they seem more shocked by the fact that he didn&amp;#39;t believe the bible was literally true than that he doubted evolution. Anyway, have fun, but keep in mind that these are polls that are heavily trafficked so we probably won&amp;#39;t make that big a dent…but let&amp;#39;s shift &amp;#39;em our way as much as we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the four polls and their results so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you believe the Bible is literally true?&lt;br&gt;
No	50%&lt;br&gt;
Yes	50%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How close are George W. Bush's views on religion to your views?&lt;br&gt;
Not at all	41%&lt;br&gt;
Somewhat	36%&lt;br&gt;
Very	13%&lt;br&gt;
Not sure	10%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which explanation about the origins of life on Earth do you believe in?&lt;br&gt;
Creationism	47%&lt;br&gt;
Evolution	34%&lt;br&gt;
Intelligent design	13%&lt;br&gt;
None of the above	6%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you think Bush's religious views affected his policies as president?&lt;br&gt;
Yes, and that bothered me	39%&lt;br&gt;
Yes, and that's fine	35%&lt;br&gt;
No	26%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like an easier poll to roll over, here's &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/culture/081209-bush-creation-religion.html"&gt;another on a different site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's Your View of Evolution and Creationism?&lt;br&gt;God created heaven, the Earth and all life in six days. Evolution explains nothing. 4% (10 votes)&lt;br&gt;

Evolution and creationism are compatible. 20% (46 votes)&lt;br&gt;

Evolution makes creationism very unlikely. 11% (24 votes)&lt;br&gt;

Evolution explains life. Creationism is just a primitive story. 65% (146 votes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a science site rather than AOL, which explains why the results so far are much more sensible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/targetrich_polling_environment.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/480059737" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228865580079"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/09/gort-bags-a-burst/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/489c98e5fe61706e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Science"/><title type="html">GORT bags a burst</title><published>2008-12-09T23:30:57Z</published><updated>2008-12-09T23:30:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/09/gort-bags-a-burst/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;No, this isn’t a Day the Earth Stood Still reference.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left side is an image taken years ago as part of &lt;a href="http://archive.eso.org/dss/dss"&gt;the Digitized Sky Survey&lt;/a&gt;, and the GORT image is on the right, with the gamma-ray burst marked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks rather ordinary, doesn’t it, just your everyday star. But that’s no star. It &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be one, a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; one, maybe even 100 times as massive as the Sun. It ran out of fuel, and its core collapsed. A black hole formed in the very heart of the star, and the forces at play were vast and violent. Twin beams of unbridled fury roared out of the dying star, each containing enough energy to vaporize the Earth a hundred million times over&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy#grb_footnote"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They screamed across the Universe, losing energy as they spread out… and eventually touched us here on Earth, so hugely diminished that it took a telescope to notice them at all. Whole planets may have been destroyed by those beams in their home galaxy, but here, on Earth, the amount of energy we received is less than that generated by the beating of a mosquito’s wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That energy swept over the Earth just before sunrise on December 3. The gamma rays from the beams were detected by the Swift satellite, which promptly determined the burst’s position and sent the coordinates to Earth. Sent out via the Internet (srsly), telescopes across the planet responded to the call, and in northern California GORT swung its eye to the position of the gamma-ray burst. Within minutes of Swift’s detection of the burst, GORT began taking its images. The picture above was from just &lt;em&gt;7 minutes&lt;/em&gt; after Swift triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m very pleased to say that this is the first GRB GORT has imaged; we tried for a long time while I was there to nail one, but irritatingly they were always poorly placed in the sky, or below the horizon, or it was cloudy, or or or. I wished we could have bagged one while I was still at SSU, but I’m still pretty chuffed the system worked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://grad40.as.utexas.edu/grblog.php?view=burst&amp;amp;GRB=081203A"&gt;GRB081203A&lt;/a&gt; (named thus because it was the first burst seen on 2008 Dec. 3) is about 10.5 billion light years away, and according to GORT got to about magnitude 12, which is actually pretty bright for a GRB (though about 1/100th as bright as the faintest star you can see with your unaided eye). Imagine something that far away — 100 &lt;em&gt;sextillion&lt;/em&gt; kilometers away — that you can see with a small telescope! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GORT is a nice setup, but it’s literally made from off-the-shelf components. You could have a similar observatory yourself in your own yard, though it’ll set you back a few dozen grand. Still, it’s not like a major institutional observatory costing tens of millions of dollars. This kind of thing is affordable by practically any University, and there are a lot of amateurs who have even slicker setups (retired lawyers and doctors have time, money, and interest). Telescopes like GORT are in many ways the equal of much larger telescopes form decades ago. The technology these days is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thanks to Kevin McLin at SSU EPO for sending me the images and answering a couple of lingering questions I had about GORT. Also my congrats to him, Lynn Cominsky (the EPO lead) and all the others in the group. Very cool, and well done!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;font size="-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;GRBs are incredibly violent and energetic events, and if one were to happen a few hundred light years from the Earth it would spell the end of pretty much all life on Earth. Happily for us they all seem to be very far away, so we’re not in any real danger.

One of the canonical complicated organs, the vertebrate eye, is a long-time favorite of creationists and IDists.  They happily quote Darwin’s &lt;a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;amp;itemID=F373&amp;amp;pageseq=204" rel="external "&gt;notorious introductory sentence&lt;/a&gt; about it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then they ignore his answer to the problem in the next sentence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now an outstanding resource to support evolutionary claims about eye evolution is available.  &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/m3k441k67q3n/" rel="external "&gt;A special issue of &lt;em&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is under the general editorship of Gregory and Niles Eldredge, is available &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; online.  The special issue was edited by &lt;a href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/12/calling-fellow-bloggers.html" rel="external "&gt;T. Ryan Gregory&lt;/a&gt;, who also wrote the Introduction to the issue.  It includes 11 articles of original research and reviews, three on curriculum possibilities, and a book review.  All told it is an excellent resource.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty astonishing! Here’s the scoop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbs and emits light at very specific wavelengths in the infrared. Theses wavelengths are like fingerprints, indicating the existence of the gas. Using a near-infrared camera on Hubble, a team led by astronomer Mark Swain (I went to grad school with him! Nice work, Mark!) took data of the planet HD 189733b, which orbits its parent star every 2.2 days. They got a spectrum of the star and the planet at the same time, and then waited until the planet was behind the star and got a spectrum of just the star by its lonesome. By subtracting the star’s spectrum from the star+planet spectrum, they got the spectrum of just the planet itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how they saw the light emitted from the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, that sounds easy enough, but in practice this is incredibly difficult and detailed work. I’ve done work like it, and I’m here tell you this is quite an achievement. It’s the first time it’s ever been done. As a bonus, they also detected carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, this planet is 63 light years away — that’s over 600 trillion kilometers (about 380 trillion miles)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost certainly, these gases are not biotic; that is, weren’t created by life. Even though the star is a bit cooler than the Sun, the planet is less than 5 million km (3 million miles) from the star, so it’s &lt;em&gt;hot&lt;/em&gt;. Most likely, the gases are abiological in origin, but this new result has interesting implications for life. If we do spot a planet that is more suitably situated for life, we might be able to detect the presence of gases indicating that biology is going on. We’ll need better telescopes and all that, but think of this current work as a proof-of-concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, methane and water vapor have been detected in this planet’s atmosphere as well. Again, they are probably not biological, but this shows that we are getting pretty good at picking through the compositions of alien worlds… and that in this case the planet must have a whopping greenhouse effect going on. And it’s not like it needs it, that close to the star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty cool discovery. Along with the other gases detected, and the direct images we’ve made of planets around other stars, this is a fantastic time to be studying planets. Even ones a long, long way away.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve argued that destroying America&amp;#39;s educational infrastructure and promoting stupid ideas like creationism will inevitably erode our country&amp;#39;s competitive standing in the world marketplace. I&amp;#39;ve always thought the only way to correct that was to improve public education — but there&amp;#39;s an alternative. &lt;a href="http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/4652/46/"&gt;Make other countries stupider&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romania's withdrawal of the theory of evolution from the school curriculum could be evidence of a growing conservative tendency in teaching. Evolution has been removed from the school curriculum in a move which, pressure groups argue, distorts children's understanding of how the world came into being.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Meanwhile, religious studies classes continue to tell Romanian children that God made the world in seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It puts this well-known chart in perspective. You might think that we ought to be struggling to climb the ladder and move from second to the last to the top by working hard and doing better than those other countries, but no — all we have to do is export some of our poisonous stupidity to other nations, and watch them fall below us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="public_acceptance_of_evolut.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/upload/2006/08/public_acceptance_of_evolut.gif" width="427" height="648"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did it with Turkey — they borrowed heavily from teams of creationist &amp;quot;arkeologists&amp;quot; who visited their country to search for a big boat dumped on Mt Ararat by a world wide flood. Romania is next — in a few years, we&amp;#39;ll be third from the bottom without even working at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet it would be easy to knock tiny Iceland off its perch. A little free television programming, a faith-based initiative to send teams of televangelists on tour, a few Mormon and Jehovah&amp;#39;s Witnesses in missionary squads…yeah, it would be far easier to destroy their brains than to improve our own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/a_brilliant_new_strategy.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/479809604" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228850192964"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/09/sino-the-times/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/68c63b4423f83632</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="DeathfromtheSkies!"/><category term="Humor"/><title type="html">Sino the times</title><published>2008-12-09T19:15:36Z</published><updated>2008-12-09T19:15:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/09/sino-the-times/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href="http://www.fawan.com/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=196047"&gt;is this a good review or not&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an interview with a Chinese newspaper a few weeks ago about my book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Death-Skies-These-Ways-World/dp/0670019976/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220913560&amp;amp;sr=8-8/badastronomy"&gt;Death from the Skies!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; It went pretty well, I thought, and they just published the article. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3095841390/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3205/3095841390_589e1d2e0b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole article is longer than that screen grab I made. Sooooo… did they like it? Beats me. But there’s been interest in publishing a Chinese edition, so maybe that’s a clue.

&lt;p&gt;The scene above is from a Pentecostal church in Detroit, where workers are rightfully concerned about their economic future. The religious approach, however, seems to be to put a couple of big ol' dinosaur SUVs (at least they're hybrids in this case) on stage, streak people's foreheads with oil, and &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/us/08pray.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=us"&gt;pray for a big bailout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they don't get a dime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that I'm unsympathetic to the plight of the workers, but this irrational approach is how they got in trouble the first time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/this_is_not_a_time_for_prayer.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/479765638" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228846486604"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/chuck_e_choke_em.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b69117f5fd826499</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Booze"/><title type="html">Chuck E.

Cheese's.  Who knew?  The Journal &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122878081364889613.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Brookfield, Wis., no restaurant has triggered more calls to the police department since last year than Chuck E. Cheese's.

&lt;p&gt;Officers have been called to break up 12 fights, some of them physical, at the child-oriented pizza parlor since January 2007. The biggest melee broke out in April, when an uninvited adult disrupted a child's birthday party. Seven officers arrived and found as many as 40 people knocking over chairs and yelling in front of the restaurant's music stage, where a robotic singing chicken and the chain's namesake mouse perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring on the science!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The environment also brings out what security experts call the "mama-bear instinct." A Chuck E. Cheese's can take on some of the dynamics of the animal kingdom, where beasts rush to protect their young when they sense a threat.

&lt;p&gt;Stepping in when a parent perceives that a child is being threatened "is part of protective parenting," says Frank Farley, a psychologist at Temple University and former president of the American Psychological Association. "It is part of the species -- all species, in fact -- in the animal kingdom," he says. "We do it all of the time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they blame the alcohol.  But how else does one tolerate Chuck E. Cheese's, and don't we all love that delicious wine on tap?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...CEC also took alcohol off the menu at a Chuck E. Cheese's in Flint, Mich., in February, a month after police responded to a fight there involving as many as 80 people.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/chuck_e_choke_em.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/479746444" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228844701763"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=893">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/b3faa753c2fe151a</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="ambiguity"/><title type="html">Believed to be an F-18</title><published>2008-12-09T17:37:46Z</published><updated>2008-12-09T17:37:46Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=893" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone following the national news in the US yesterday — and perhaps many of you following international news elsewhere — has undoubtedly heard about the tragic crash of an F/A-18D fighter jet in San Diego yesterday morning. (The pilot managed to eject safely, but the plane crashed into a house, killing &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20081209-9999-7n9jetdown.html"&gt;[a] mother, her young child and the child's grandmother&lt;/a&gt;".) The fighter was on a training mission over the Pacific Ocean, and according to reports had already lost an engine over the ocean. Nevertheless, the pilot was apparently instructed to fly the jet to the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, which requires flying over residential and business areas just south of UC San Diego (where my basement office in Language Log Plaza is located). This is where the plane crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, this is Language Log — what&amp;#39;s this post about? Well, it turns out that this unspeakable tragedy has a couple of linguistic twists. First and foremost, two UC San Diego linguistics graduate students live a stone&amp;#39;s throw away from where the plane hit; fortunately, both students (and their home) are safe and sound. Second, one of those students (hat-tip, &lt;a href="http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~cynkil/"&gt;Cindy&lt;/a&gt;) noted an early news report with the following structurally-ambiguous sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot of the plane, believed to be an F-18, reportedly ejected safely and parachuted to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The source was our local &lt;a href="http://www.10news.com/news/18229447/detail.html"&gt;ABC Channel 10 news website&lt;/a&gt;, but the text has since been changed; I found a clipping of it &lt;a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread417950/pg1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the intended, sensical reading is for the verb phrase &lt;i&gt;believed to be an F-18&lt;/i&gt; to modify the noun &lt;i&gt;plane&lt;/i&gt;, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pilot2.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/pilot2.png" alt="" title="pilot2" width="500" height="163"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;plane&lt;/i&gt; is embedded inside a prepositional phrase that itself modifies the noun &lt;i&gt;pilot&lt;/i&gt;, and for reasons I won&amp;#39;t go into here — go nuts, syntactically-oriented commenters — (many) English speakers are (often) initially tempted to have the verb phrase modify that &amp;#39;higher&amp;#39; noun, even though the result is non-sensical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, in 1998 we had two blockbuster movies (&lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/armpitageddon.html"&gt;&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which sucked, and &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/movies/di2.html"&gt;&amp;quot;Deep Impact&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; which was excellent) showing us that asteroid and comet impacts could generate giant tsunamis, wipe out all life, cause lots of quick-cut camera shots, make Ben Affleck cry, and so on, but in the intervening years they haven’t gotten as much attention. There have been documentaries on TV and some coverage in the dead tree media, but that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/files/2008/12/asteroid_incoming.jpg" alt="Artist drawing of an asteroid entering Earth’s atmosphere"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the past couple of weeks there’s been a resurgence of interest. Of course, having three big, bright fireballs lighting up the skies recently didn’t hurt: the one in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/10/06/incoming-2/"&gt;Darfur&lt;/a&gt; months ago, or the one in &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/20/alberta-meteor-eh/"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; weeks ago, or the one in &lt;a href="http://www.universetoday.com/2008/12/06/exploding-colorado-fireball-100-times-brighter-than-the-moon-video/"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; the other night (which I missed, dagnappit!). Maybe it was the publishing of a brilliant book with a whole chapter dealing with asteroid impacts. Hard to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most likely it was the reporting on findings from panels of top-level scientists on the topic that’s caused a mini-flurry of stories. &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7760659.stm"&gt;The BBC news had a story on it&lt;/a&gt; just the other day. They interviewed Professor Richard Crowther, chair of the UN Working Group on Near Earth Objects (NEOs); and as you might expect, his conclusion was that we need to get off our asteroids and &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document says most asteroids entering the Earth’s atmosphere are small and burn up before reaching the surface. But it is the larger ones - perhaps 200m or more across - that would need to be deflected away from a collision course with the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a rock 50 meters across could take out a city, exploding high in the atmosphere and generating a devastating shock wave and fireball. But it’s literally impossible to find asteroids that small very long before impact. 150 meters or so is a reasonable size to find, and that’s also about the size where they start doing damage on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK newspaper &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/dec/07/space-technology-asteroid-shield"&gt;The Guardian also picked up on this story&lt;/a&gt;, talking about (what I think is) a different group called the International Panel on Asteroid Threat Mitigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international community must begin work now on forging three impact prevention elements - warning, deflection technology and a decision-making process - into an effective defence against a future collision,’ said the International Panel on Asteroid Threat Mitigation, which is chaired by former American astronaut Russell Schweickart. The panel made its presentation at the UN’s building in Vienna.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important point, We need to find these suckers, we need to understand what to do, and we need to understand how to do it. Think of it this way: we find an asteroid 300 meters across, and calculate it will hit in Germany. Uh oh! So we launch a rocket, use our tech, and push it out of the way… kinda. Something goes wrong, and it only gets nudged. We recalculate the path… and find out it will now hit Pakistan. Oops! Their government might be a little ticked over such a thing, so we need to have some sort of process in place to deal with these (fairly realistic) issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that scientists are able to get their reports out to the public, and I certainly hope the UN takes the threat seriously — they will meet in February to discuss the issue. This is a global problem, and needs to be dealt with on an international scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228843355541"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=390">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0aec690f21d29250</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">I COME FROM THE PAST</title><published>2008-12-09T17:16:16Z</published><updated>2008-12-09T17:16:16Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?p=390" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Damn it, I forgot it was my day to post to the SGU Blog. That’s okay, though, because yesterday was Pretend To Be a Time-Traveler Day. I traveled through time to x-post the following from Skepchick. SCORE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 8 &lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/geekdad/2007/12/pretend-to-be-a.html"&gt;is a very important day&lt;/a&gt;, as I’m sure you all know. (There’s a chance you didn’t know at one point, but once you learned, you manipulated time in order to return to a point in the past that would effectively mean you always knew.) In the spirit of the holiday, I thought I’d post to let you all know that I have arrived here from December 8, 2012, where the world population waits terrified in anticipation of the end of everything, as predicted by the Mayans. (You can learn more about it &lt;a href="http://www.december212012.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) I have traveled through time carrying a desperate warning, and a plea for help. Please, read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Hoy_botnb.jpg" alt="Nuclear Baby" width="250" height="334"&gt;I talked about some end-of-the-world scenarios &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1515"&gt;on Skepchick before&lt;/a&gt;, and we talked about the specific absurdity of the 2012 end-of-days theory on &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=133"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe back in February of 2008&lt;/a&gt; (”this year,” to you non-time travelers), but to recap: the Mayans were pretty brainy people, but nothing they ever did would suggest they had the power to predict the end of all life as we know it. See, they kept track of time using different calendars, one of which is known today as the Long Count Calendar. Like our calendar year, everything was referenced in terms of cycles, and the end of a cycle also meant it was the beginning of the next cycle. That changeover was a really great excuse to party, kind of like how &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; party at the end of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; annual cycle by paying a ridiculous cover charge to get into an otherwise cruddy bar where we’re given a thimble of cheap sparkling wine, which we drink and then make-out awkwardly with some guy we just met because god damn it it’s New Year’s and we’ll be damned if we’re going to spend it alone like last year, crying into a tub of ice cream and passing out in front of Dick Clark at 10:30pm. I mean, I guess some people might celebrate like that. In your time. Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point being that in all likelihood, not even the Mayans thought the world would end on December 21, 2012. It’s yet another apocalyptic fantasy made up by New Age crackpots with so much time on their hands that they need to pretend that time is running out faster than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, you are probably wondering why I, as an accomplished time traveler, have fled from December of 2012 in order to take up residence back here in 2008. After all, if the Mayans didn’t actually predict the world would end that month, why would I want to leave a time known for peace, prosperity, and ten to twenty more cupcakes a day than what humans averaged in 2008? Well, it’s simple . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . the New Age crackpots are driving me &lt;em&gt;nuts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve come to 2008 with a plea for your help. I need you – all of you – to help prevent a future of crackpots crying nonstop about the end of the world, with a hundred times more shrillness than any of those panicking over Y2K. Tell your friends! Your family! The world! Tell them to please stop getting all their information on the time-keeping habits of ancient civilizations from poorly designed web pages and emails with subject lines that read “Fwd: FW: FW: FW: FW: Fwd: END OF WORLD PERDICTED BY MYANS!!!!” Please. The future depends upon it. My sanity depends upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus&lt;/strong&gt;: it’s been a long time since I’ve shared an email chain from my workplace. Here’s a mass email I sent this morning. I love my coworkers, who are funny and put up with me five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;

The project, sponsored by the secular think tank Center for Inquiry and its Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion (CSER), is an effort by historians, biblical scholars, and theologians to determine what can be reliably recovered about the historical figure of Jesus, his life, his teachings, and his activities, utilizing the highest standards of scientific and scholarly objectivity. &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An earlier inquiry, "The Jesus Seminar," founded by Professor Robert Funk in 1985, concerned itself primarily with the sayings attributed to Jesus in the Gospels and related sources. Dr. R. Joseph Hoffmann, chair of the Project and CSER, said that the "The Jesus Seminar had difficulty separating itself from the faith commitments of its members. Its agenda was not exclusively, but in large measure theologically driven. Its conclusions and methods raised more questions than they answered." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The project has drawn together a diverse and rich group of scholars, including, among others Gerd Lüdemann, Paul Kurtz, Robert Price, James Tabor, Robert Eisenman, David Trobisch, Bruce Chilton, Dennis MacDonald, and R. Joseph Hoffmann. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the session this past weekend, participants agreed that a rigorous scientific inquiry was needed, and that the Project would be committed to a position of neutrality towards the sources used as "evidence" for the Jesus tradition. Participants represent a wide variety of perspectives, ranging from Tabor's argument that there is substantial evidence that the tomb of the family of Jesus has been located, to the view that the evidence for the existence of Jesus as an historical figure is not persuasive. "Jesus remains after 2,000 years the most fascinating figure of Western civilization," said James Tabor, author of The Jesus Dynasty: A New Historical Investigation of Jesus, His Royal Family, and the Birth of Christianity. "Scholars now at the beginning of the twenty-first century are able to take advantage of a plethora of new texts, sources, and methods, including the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, various lost Gospels that are not in our New Testament, and a rich archaeological record." Tabor says that scholars today find themselves uniquely positioned to examine the issue of who Jesus was in new and challenging ways. During the closing conference round-table, Tabor was quick to emphasize that "the Jesus Project repudiates any theological agendas, special pleading, or dogmatic presuppositions." All members of the project share a common commitment to the importance of applying scientific methodologies to the sources used to construct the Jesus tradition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Project has outlined a set of priorities for its next meetings, including a "consistent" translation of the Gospels, an inquiry into the causes of the canonization of the existing New Testament documents, parallels between Islam and early Christianity in delineating its sacred books, and the need to carve a middle path between what Hoffmann describes as "Da Vinci Code sensationalism and the truly fascinating story that underlies the history of Christianity."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Papers delivered at the conference will be published under the title "Sources of the Jesus Tradition: An Inquiry," by Prometheus Books in 2009. The Project's next conference is scheduled tentatively for May 2009 in Chicago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Listen to Robert Price &lt;a href="http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wbfo/news.newsmain?action=article&amp;amp;ARTICLE_ID=1432152"&gt;interview about The Jesus Project on WBFO&lt;/a&gt;, Buffalo's NPR affiliate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

they said, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!" 

4 How can we sing the songs of the LORD

To begin with, I want to note that no one piece of the evidence we have seems to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Jesus existed, but when taken together it looks more likely than not that Jesus existed. In this post, I am going to begin with some arguments which I think support a historical Jesus, then move on to bad or feeble arguments for a historical Jesus (This is intended to a series of posts, each looking at different arguments concerning Jesus’ historicity.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Arguments for a historical Jesus:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. In Mark 15 Jesus’ last words are recorded: “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani”, which is Aramaic for “My God, My God, Why hast thou forsaken me?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why is this signifigant? Well, you have to remember that Mark was written in Greek even though first century Judeans spoke Aramaic. It would make sense for Jesus’ followers to want to preserve his exact words, untranslated and as he spoke them. Yet it would not make sense to record this if Jesus had been viewed as a cosmic, supernatural figure who never walked the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Paul calls Jesus the “first fruits” of those who have fallen asleep (1 Corinthians 15:20). What Paul seems to be saying (reading the passage in context) is that Jesus was the first of the dead to be resurrected (It was thought that in the end times all the dead would be raised) and that the end times were now. This implies Jesus was a man of flesh and blood and lived recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad/Feeble Arguments for a Historical Jesus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The argument (or rather, arguments, as this involves many scriptures) we will consider is the argument from the Pauline epistles. This argument contends that &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. The letters of Paul were written in the 50’s (This is not doubted by even non-Christian scholars).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Paul Speaks of Jesus as a Historical Person (This is disputable, as we will see, many people misinterpret Paul as speaking literally when, read in context, he speaking figuratively. I know of only two Pauline passages which clearly point to a historical Jesus and I have mentioned them above).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. No one would invent a figure who lived so recently (less than 20 years prior) in Judea and contended that they knew his siblings and had those who had known him during his life. (I have no truck with this conclusion so long as the premises are sound).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let’s take a look at the passages John posted in one of his blog posts about the historical Jesus:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus descended from Abraham (Gal. 3:16); &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let’s look at the passage:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," meaning one person, who is Christ. What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We notice right off the bat that the connection between Jesus and Abraham is probably not a literal, flesh and blood relationship, at least in this context: There was something about Jesus which made him a successor to Abraham, something which was beyond DNA (Since the Jewish people were not also considered to be Abraham’s “seed” in the same sense that Jesus was). We also need to pay attention to the metaphor in use here, which I will discuss shortly: In Galatians 4 Paul also discusses how Sarah and Hagar, the wife and concubine of Abraham, should be thought of figuratively and how the Christians are the sons of Sarah, the free woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Jesus] was born of a woman and lived under Jewish law (Gal. 4:4);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allow to provide a lengthy excerpt from an &lt;a href="http://www.rationalresponders.com/paul_and_identity"&gt;essay by Rook Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;, who explains this passage much more clearly than I am able:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those out to verify the historical Jesus are quick to jump on this verse without considering what Paul is actually saying here. This verse is taken for granted, presupposed to be about a person which Paul never knew. For Jesus was not born at all but made (genomenon), specifically, under the law. What is the law? Paul actually tells us what “the law” (tou nomou) means. “It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator (mesitou).” (Gal. 3:19) Paul clarifies for us, “For we know that the law (ho nomos) is spiritual (pneumatikos), but I am of the flesh (sarkinos), sold under sin.” (Rom. 7:14) To Paul, what comes from the flesh is corruption and sinful. “For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh.” (Rom. 7:18) The law is the spiritual custodian (ephrouroumetha) of the flesh, a teacher by which Paul feels leads one to life. It is through this custodian, the spirit, per Paul, that we are also saved. There is also an underlining allegory to this passage that most scholars seem to ignore.[28] Do those who want to understand Paul so easily forget the allegory of the two women, Sarah and Hagar, for which we are all a part of?[29] This chapter (Galatians 4) is not about Jesus at all. It is entirely about the law and how to be saved under the law.[30]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don't you listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the free woman. However, the son by the handmaid was made according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was made through promise. These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar. For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children. But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all. For it is written, "Rejoice, you barren who don't bear. Break forth and shout, you that don't travail. For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has a husband." Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise. But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. However what does the Scripture say? "Throw out the handmaid and her son, for the son of the handmaid will not inherit with the son of the free woman." So then, brothers, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the free woman.” – Paul, Galatians 4:21-31&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The context is very important. Jesus is made under the law—the spiritual custodian—by a “woman” or specifically, “the Jerusalem above” (hê de anô Ierousalêm), which also happens to allegorically be the mother to everyone. Not everyone in a worldly sense, Paul makes this clear, “for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.” (Rom. 1:16) But Paul was speaking specifically to everyone who is adopted into the death of Jesus Christ, “but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’” (Rom. 8:15) And here the understanding of the parable comes back around. We die, the same way Jesus dies. We call out to our father, allegorically, as we become kin with Jesus through the spirit. But through this death we are saved, from the flesh which is corrupt, through a rebirth. This rebirth is of this allegorical woman in the same way that Paul’s Jesus is born through the same allegorical woman. Indirectly we, like Jesus, are born again spiritually by way of the heavens, or directly, by God.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Jesus] was the son of David (Romans 1:3);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to keep this article’s length to a minimum, I ask you to read the essay linked above as it also has the answer to this passage: It is an allegory intending to portray Jesus as one who treated Jews and Gentiles according to their deeds, just as David did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Jesus] had a brother named James (Gal. 1:19) and other brothers (I Cor. 9:5). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both of these passages use the phrase “brother of the Lord” or “brothers of the Lord” which seems to me to indicate a spiritual relationship rather than a genetic one (Why not simply call James, ‘the brother of Jesus’). I also must note the words of early church father Origen:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Now this James was he whom that genuine disciple of Jesus, Paul, said he had seen as the Lord’s brother; [Gal. i. 19.] which relation implies not so much nearness of blood, or the sameness of education, as it does the agreement of manners and preaching. If therefore he says the desolation of Jerusalem befell the Jews for the sake of James, with how much greater reason might he have said, that it happened for the sake of Jesus."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I also need to note that I have discussed this with Dr. James McGrath and he told me that by the third century some Christians believed Mary remained a virgin her whole life and thus they sought to explain away the references to Jesus’ siblings as symbolic. But think about this: Would it make more sense for the perpetual virgin dogma to spring up from a sect which believed (originally, at least) in a spiritual Christ, or would it make more sense to think that one day Christians decided Mary had to be a virgin and so they’d just explain away all the references to her other children? Of course, religious dogmas rarely make sense, so perhaps it is the latter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper (I Cor. 11:23-25); was betrayed (I Cor. 11;23);&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does not tell us where or when Jesus was killed, and so this does not affect the Jesus myth theory as I present it: Jesus may have appeared to Paul in a vision with a cup of wine and a loaf of bread and instituted the eucharist for all we know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[He] was killed by the Jews of Judea (I Thess. 2:14-15), &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is very likely an interpolation (&lt;a href="http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=2523"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt;). Although the link I give is to one of those “conservative Christian” sites, there is a reasonable discussion of why this is thought to be a later addition to the text. In the end, however, I must disagree with the author’s conclusion that we need a text without the offending passage to make up our minds about its authenticity. The earliest manuscripts of Paul’s letters date to well over 100 years after Paul wrote, and we know that scribes made alterations to Biblical texts they copied (See Misquoting Jesus by Bart Ehrman). So there may be a lot of interpolations which we will never be able to prove (using manuscriptural evidence) are interpolations. We are stuck looking for clues within the text.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[H]e was buried and seen as resurrecting (I Cor. 15:4-8).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, where and when?

&lt;p&gt;Not bad. The description of the algorithm is a bit thin, but he promises to release the source code soon. It sounds like a million generations is an overestimate, since his population size in each generation was 1, and it also sounds like his selection was far more stringent than you'd find in nature, but it's an interesting if oversimplified example of the power of chance and selection.&lt;/p&gt;

He's very cranky about the atheist sign in the capitol of Washington state, which is Olympia, so he rants against Seattle. I'm sure it makes sense in Billo World.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle now rivals San Francisco for secular-progressive nuttiness. The city fathers are allowing public nakedness in city parks, nude bike riding, and in Fremont, a Seattle suburb, they actually put up a statue honoring Lenin, the father of communism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s wrong with nudity? That sounds like a perfectly reasonable idea, especially in such a cloudy place — it would increase the exposed surface area for enhanced synthesis of vitamin D. It&amp;#39;s probably not something people could do very often there, but in the summer…sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Lenin_(Seattle)"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; is lovely. It wasn&amp;#39;t put up to honor Lenin, though — it was a work of art rescued from a Russian scrapyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some on the Seattle school board actually supported denigrating Thanksgiving by teaching children about the atrocities against Native Americans by the Pilgrims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than keeping the children in ignorance? What does Bill think the purpose of a school is? I think it is a good idea for students to learn from the ugly events in our history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Washington State voters have passed assisted suicide, and the state gives out free birth control pills, including the "morning after" pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is wonderful! A state that promotes dignity for all and freedom for women, that does the right thing to reduce teen pregnancy, and uses government to promote the welfare of society. What's the objection?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the quality-of-life front, the streets of Seattle are full of homeless people, but they don't have to be out in the rain. The city will pay to house alcoholics and drug addicts if they want it. They can actually get free furnished apartments. Taxpayers, of course, pick up the tab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping the poor and needy? My dog, this place sounds like &lt;i&gt;paradise&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything he listed sounds great! Bill O'Reilly has succeeded in making me homesick. I want to go back now, even though I know Seattle can't quite be the rosy-dawned utopia he's painting for us here.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve been dealing with creationists for a long time now, and I thought that I’d gotten over being surprised by dishonest behavior in their ranks. In fact, I thought I’d gotten over it &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/03/two_things_that_dont_go_togeth.php" rel="external "&gt;even when I’m on the receiving end of the false witness, and when the person dishing it out is someone who really should know better&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, I might not have quite as far over it as I thought. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As regular readers know, Dr. Michael Egnor is one of the more impressively credentialed denizens of the Discovery Institute’s media complaints blog. He has decades of experience as a neurosurgeon. He’s on the faculty at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, where he serves as a professor of neurosurgery. And, based on the level of intellectual integrity that he just demonstrated, he’s not someone I would trust to train a dog, much less a doctor. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That’s a harsh statement, I know, but I just got through reading &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/12/mike_dunford_alleles_that_surv.html" rel="external "&gt;his response&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2008/11/egnor_shoots_he_scores.php" rel="external "&gt;my recent critique&lt;/a&gt; of some of his Discovery Institute ramblings. Or, rather, his response to what he &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; was my recent critique. It was actually an interesting experience. He managed to take what I wrote so far out of context, and distort it so thoroughly, that I actually had problems recognizing some of the quotes as being my own work. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I may (or may not) deal with the nonexistent scientific merit of Dr. Egnor’s reply later on. I’m not even going to try and catalogue all of the cases where Egnor was less than honest in his characterization of my writing. Instead, I’m simply going to highlight the most egregious case of flat-out, nose-growing, pants-on-fire lying. 
&lt;/p&gt;

This post was inspired by an article in which historian of the Nazi era Richard Evans was featured in a &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/3540339/How-Hitler-perverted-the-course-of-science.html"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; about Nazi science and expressed his amazement at how much Nazi science was treated just like any other science, with little or no comment by other scientists of the era about the completely unethical and downright evil nature of the experiments, which reduced human beings to the status of laboratory animals, and badly treated ones at that. This "normalization" of the horrible applied even to the horrific experiments at Auschwitz, including those by Dr. Josef Mengele, and performed in other camps. In this, perhaps such a noted expert on the Nazi era should not be so surprised, because if there was one trait that characterized the Nazi regime as a whole, it was the normalization of the horrific, the banalization of evil, as it has sometimes been referred to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main refrains in the comments posted in response to my intellectual meanderings and speculations was that Nazi science couldn't have been good science because the overarching ideology of the Nazi regime perverted it and led Nazi scientists to pursue pseudoscience in the name of the mystical strains in their racial ideology. Such ideological contamination of science led to studies designed to find anatomical differences between Jews and Aryans that could explain Aryan superiority, using methodology based on the previous racial pseudoscience known as racial hygiene; expeditions to Tibet; studies looking for every detail known about Thor's hammer, and archaeology expeditions in search for the Aryan founders of every civilization. This latter belief of Himmler and other Nazis was based on the &lt;a href="http://archaeology.about.com/od/heritagemanagement/fr/pringle06.htm"&gt;idea&lt;/a&gt; that there were three types of people: the founders of culture, the bearers of culture and the destroyers of culture. (Guess who the destroyers were and who the founders were.) In any case, this idea led Nazis to believe that, if they looked long and hard enough, their archaeologists would inevitably find Aryans as the founders of every major culture. When they didn't, they became increasingly desperate and branched out into ever more bizarre hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/was_nazi_science_good_science_part_ii.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/was_nazi_science_good_science_part_ii.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/479559452" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228830998404"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4593">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9868b130374aec1c</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Quickies"/><title type="html">Skepchick Quickies 12.9</title><published>2008-12-09T13:42:35Z</published><updated>2008-12-09T13:42:35Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4593" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=808dec167bb32ef006d87b8df6d4a6a1&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

More precisely, can you translate an instance of one game — a match or a round or whatever — into an instance of another game, as you can translate a sentence or a paragraph of Chinese into a sentence or a paragraph of English?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helen DeWitt &lt;a href="http://paperpools.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-game-new-game-new-game.html"&gt;sensibly says that you can't&lt;/a&gt;. But I think that there's more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's Helen's argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Suppose I grow up in a family where people obsessively play Hearts. We switch around between different versions of the game - sometimes we play Black Maria, where the Queen of Spades costs you 13 points and you pass on three cards to the left before you begin play, sometimes we invent twists of our own. I also have four friends: A lives in a family of chess fanatics, B lives in a family of bridge fanatics, C lives in a family of go fanatics, D lives in a family of poker fanatics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;What I see at once is something remarkable. Languages are translatable, more or less; it may be more or less tricky, but it's intelligible to speak of Chinese being translated into Turkish AND Arabic AND English. Games are not translatable. Chess is a game for two players with complete information; you can't "explain" what's going on in a chess game in terms of bridge, which is a game for two sets of partners with imperfect information, a mixture of skill and chance which depends on skilful sharing of information between partners. And you can't "explain" either in terms of poker, which is a game for an indeterminate number of players, a mixture of skill and chance in which sharing of information between players would in fact be collusion and outlawed. A game is intelligible on its own terms - which means, paradoxically, that you can play a game with someone whose language you don't know, provided you both know the rules of the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly true about hearts, chess, and poker. But there are some special games, probably never played by any family for fun, where it may be false. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on &lt;a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-games/"&gt;Logic and Games&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Important examples are semantic games used to define truth, back-and-forth games used to compare structures, and dialogue games to express (and perhaps explain) formal proofs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this realm, there are circumstances that make it plausible to talk about a translation from one game to another. For example, suppose we provide game-theoretic semantics for two different logics that express propositions about the same sorts of worlds, or two different programming languages that apply similar sets of actions to the same sorts of states. Then it may make sense to talk about translating "games" of one kind into "games" of another kind, just as it makes sense to talk about translating logical expressions or translating computer programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sorts of relationships are possible here, I think. Two game-systems might be isomorphic, in the sense that every game-instance in game-sytem A is translatable into a game-instance in system B, and vice versa. Or game A might properly include game B, in the sense that every game-instance of B can be translated into A, but not vice versa; or two games might have both an intersection and a symmetric difference that are non-null.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is irrelevant to Helen's point about the impossibility of radical translation between chess and hearts. But she was responding to a &lt;a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/003333.php"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; where Language Hat quoted Remy de Gourmont on the need for writers to break the rules of their cultural tradition ("Le crime capital pour un écrivain c'est le conformisme, l'imitativité, la soumission aux règles et aux enseignements"). And her next two sentences were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;You don't understand a game in terms of some other game, you understand it by learning to play it - but the more games you play, the more you will understand about the radical otherness of games. And this, it seems to me, is the sense in which Gourmont thinks each writer will develop his own aesthetics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the cultural patterns in question are more like logic or computer programming than like chess or hearts, in the sense that they're not just systems for scoring a sequence of ritualized actions, but also ways to express, communicate, or modify meanings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this connection, it may be interesting to raise a question that puzzles game-theoretic logicians. Quoting again from the Stanford Encyclopedia article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In most applications of logical games, the central notion is that of a winning strategy for the player ∃. Often these strategies (or their existence) turn out to be equivalent to something of logical importance that could have been defined without using games — for example a proof. But games are felt to give a better definition because they quite literally supply some motivation: ∃ is trying to win. This raises a question that is not of much interest mathematically, but it should concern philosophers who use logical games. If we want ∃'s motivation in a game G to have any explanatory value, then we need to understand what is achieved if ∃ does win. In particular we should be able to tell a realistic story of a situation in which some agent called ∃ is trying to do something intelligible, and doing it is the same thing as winning in the game. As Richard Dawkins said, raising the corresponding question for the evolutionary games of Maynard Smith,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:60px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt; The whole purpose of our search … is to discover a suitable actor to play the leading role in our metaphors of purpose. We … want to say, ‘It is for the good of … ‘. Our quest in this chapter is for the right way to complete that sentence. (The Extended Phenotype, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1982, page 91.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;For future reference let us call this the Dawkins question. In many kinds of logical game it turns out to be distinctly harder to answer than the pioneers of these games realised. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(A notational note: the two players in these games are conventionally known as &lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;∃ and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#000000"&gt;∀, which are the symbols for the existential and universal quantifiers, but here are pronounced "Eloise" and "Abelard".)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reference to Jaakko Hintikka's influential game-theoretic semantics for the predicate calculus, the article adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Computer implementations of these games of Hintikka proved to be a very effective way of teaching the meanings of first-order sentences. One such package was designed by Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy at Stanford, called ‘&lt;a href="http://ggww2.stanford.edu/GUS/tarskisworld/index.jsp"&gt;Tarski's World’&lt;/a&gt;. Independently another team at the University of Omsk constructed a Russian version for use at schools for gifted children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;In the published version of his John Locke lectures at Oxford, Hintikka in 1973 raised the Dawkins question (see above) for these games. His answer was that one should look to Wittgenstein's language games, and the language games for understanding quantifiers are those which revolve around seeking and finding. In the corresponding logical games one should think of ∃ as Myself and ∀ as a hostile Nature who can never be relied on to present the object I want; so to be sure of finding it, I need a winning strategy. This story was never very convincing; the motivation of Nature is irrelevant, and nothing in the logical game corresponds to seeking. In retrospect it is a little disappointing that nobody took the trouble to look for a better story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Robert Furber writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Translating between games can in some cases be defined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Andre Joyal defined a category (in the sense of category theory) of games based on John Conway's theory of two-player games with complete information. A translation into English of the original note is &lt;a href="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~rhouston/Joyal-games.ps"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Because Conway's theory allows games to be added and negated, I can think of a strategy for A - B to be a thing that would be a strategy for A if only I had a strategy for B (the article explains this in more detail). This is rather like two things:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;1. The way implication works under the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of (intuitionistic) logic. A proof of A -&amp;gt; B is a function that turns a proof of A into a proof of B.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;2. Subtraction of vectors. A - B tells you how to get from B to A. This relates to translation in the sense it's used in geometry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update #2: Vykromond Jorilliam points to a very different sort of idea –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Raph Koster's attempts at establishing a "game grammar" (&lt;a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1979/defining_games_raph_kosters_game_.php"&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1979/defining_games_raph_kosters_game_.php&lt;/a&gt;) might be relevant to this topic as an approach to attempt to identify a formal "language" for games that would allow for, among other things, translation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting-sounding idea, reminiscent in some ways of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://nickm.com/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Nick Montfort&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;#39;s work on interactive fiction. But I can&amp;#39;t tell from the cited interview, or from any of the links it contains, what Koster actually means, and whether there&amp;#39;s more to his idea so far than a perceived need and a general prescription for the shape of a solution. ]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228824270012"><id gr:original-id="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=435">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/9fd745f175c487a9</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="General Science"/><title type="html">SETI Science</title><published>2008-12-09T12:00:17Z</published><updated>2008-12-09T12:00:17Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theness.com/neurologicablog/?p=435" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://theness.com/neurologicablog" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am a strong supporter of SETI - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. To me this is a fascinating scientific endeavor with a potentially huge payoff. And yet, I find that even within skeptical circles I hear grumblings that SETI is not real science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary complaint stems from the misapplication of an important scientific principle - that a necessary criterion for any scientific hypothesis is that it needs to be falsifiable. If you cannot make an observation or conduct an experiment to prove an idea wrong, then that idea is not useful to science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SETI critics argue that the notion of extraterrestrial intelligence is inherently unfalsifiable. No matter how much you look with negative results, one could always argue that it is not enough, we have to look deeper into space, for fainter signals, in more EM frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this, however, does not render SETI unfalsifiable in the that is meant by philosophers of science, because it runs up against another scientific principle - the notion that you cannot prove a negative.  It is logically impossible to prove completely that a phenomenon does not exist (unless it can be demonstrated that it violates know laws - but even then the proof is only as good as the degree to which the violated laws are established). Evidence for the lack of a phenomenon is always only as good as the thoroughness and efficacy of the search methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can apply this to anything is science, even drug trials. If a large well-designed clinical trial shows that drug A does not improve disease B what it really showed is at the dose and duration given it did not have an effect big enough to be detected with statistical significant by the study. You cannot rule out a small effect, a subpopulation effect, or that a higher dose would not have shown an effect. What the study does, in effect, is set statistical limits on the size and scope of an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search for ET (or any new phenomenon) is the same.  We can never prove that there are no ET’s in the universe - but that’s not the point. The more searching we do with negative results the more statistical limits we can set on the number of ET civilizations that are engaging in specific behaviors - like broadcasting at certain frequencies. Right now, for example, we can say there aren’t numerous nearby ET civilzations or artifacts braodcasting in our direction in the radio frequencies we have listened to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081208/full/news.2008.1287.html"&gt;recent Nature commentary&lt;/a&gt;, Philip Ball also feels the need to defend SETI.  He discusses another method (other than listening for radio signals) for looking for ET, writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dyson suggested that a sufficiently advanced civilization would baulk at the prospect of its star’s energy radiating uselessly into space. They could capture it, he said, by breaking up other planets in their solar system into rubble that would form a spherical shell — known as a Dyson sphere — around the star, creating a surface on which the solar energy could be harvested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is talking about the work of Richard Carrigan, who asked a specific question: are there any detectable Dyson spheres within about 1000 light years. That is not the same thing as asking if there are any ET’s, rather its a proxy question. It’s a method of looking where the light is good. What behaviors might ET be engaged in that we can detect. Well, they may be broadcasting at us in the radio frequency. Or they may have buit something like a Dyson sphere around their star - perhaps we can detect that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these methods require speculation about what an ET civilization might do. This is problematic because really we have no idea. All we really can do is assume that humanity is somewhat representative of technological intelligence and then speculate about what a more advanced version of our own civilization might do. It’s a pretty thin line of reasoning, although it is legitimate as far as it goes. We just know we are speculating from too little information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another recent SETI “innovation” was to assume that ET might be interested in looking for life elsewhere in the galaxy. They might start by looking for planets around other systems, and planets like earth would be easiest to detect from a direction in the plane of our system. Therefore, to those observers the earth would eclipse the sun and that is one way they could detect it. It might be more likely, therefore, that such civilizations are broadcasting at us, because they know we are here, or at least life might be here. Perhaps, then, SETI should focus its efforts by looking at stars in the plane of our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is another long chain of speculation - but very interesting, and legitimate as far as it goes. This is an effective investigational logic to use - imagine what might be the case, then take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It still strikes me as odd when people use this feature of SETI to argue that it is pseudoscience. No -it would only be pseudoscience if SETI proponents concluded that ET exists based on such reasoning, or to explain away negative results. But this is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis upon which to design a program for searching for data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SETI programs also use a very reasonable protocol for dealing with signals when they encounter them. They consider such signals an anomaly, then they systematically rule out possible known causes.  So far, every candidate signal has turned out to be something known - no enduring anomalies. This behavior is very different from pseudoscientists, who might call such signals “ET signals” and then proceed to only rule out a couple of obvious known causes, or then dismiss non-ET explanations for the signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take ghost hunters, for example.They typically look for anomalous photographic effects, declare such anomalies to be “ghost globules” and then dismiss any non-ghost explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to properly demarcate legitimate science from the “cheap imitation.” In my book, SETI is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, with SETI we just might hit the cosmic lottery and find genuine evidence for ET. That’s worth the tiny investment currently going to SETI projects. Even knowing that our galactic neighborhood is relatively empty is interesting information. Perhaps humanity is more rare than we imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course nothing would be more fascinating than discovering that we are being bathed in a stream of information from an advanced alien culture.  I like just knowing that SETI makes that possible.&lt;/p&gt;

And please, President-elect Obama, clear away the rotting debris of this ghastly administration. The latest example of dreadful Bush appointees: &lt;a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/12/08/johnson-science-faith/"&gt;Stephen Johnson, head of the EPA&lt;/a&gt;. Asked about the evolution/creation debate, this is what he had to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not a clean-cut division. If you have studied at all creationism vs. evolution, there's theistic or God-controlled evolution and there's variations on all those themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wobble and waffle. Religion and science, it's all the same to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might say that maybe this is irrelevant — as the EPA chief, he&amp;#39;s just a bureaucrat who must manage a horde of underlings, and his scientific qualifications aren&amp;#39;t all that important. Now I&amp;#39;d hope that the guy who is in charge of protecting the environment would know something about science and would care about the environment, but Johnson seems to be a complete flack, a lackey for corporate interests. &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tfk/2008/12/the_creationist_running_the_ep.php"&gt;Josh Rosenau sums him up&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, on evolution, he rejects scientific evidence in favor of the opinion of his authority figures. On climate change, he again rejects the scientific evidence in favor of the opinion of his authority figure. On the ethics of human testing of pesticides, on the appropriateness of using atrazine, on the environmental risks of mega-farms, and on value of a human life in cost-benefit analyses, Johnson has consistently ignored his scientific advisors, going along with the opinions of his political superiors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the above links also tap into this &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=6418908"&gt;typical interview with George W. Bush&lt;/a&gt;. We have had this joker in office far too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MCFADDEN:&lt;/strong&gt; Is it literally true, the Bible?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUSH:&lt;/strong&gt; You know. Probably not ... No, I'm not a literalist, but I think you can learn a lot from it, but I do think that the New Testament, for example is ... has got ... You know, the important lesson is "God sent a son."&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MCFADDEN:&lt;/strong&gt; So, you can read the Bible...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUSH:&lt;/strong&gt; That God in the flesh, that mankind can understand there is a God who is full of grace and that nothing you can do to earn his love. His love is a gift and that in order to draw closer to God and in order to express your appreciation for that love is why you change your behavior.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MCFADDEN:&lt;/strong&gt; So, you can read the Bible and not take it literally.  I mean you can -- it's not inconsistent to love the Bible and believe in evolution, say.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUSH:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I mean, I do. I mean, evolution is an interesting subject.  I happen to believe that evolution doesn't fully explain the mystery of life and ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MCFADDEN: &lt;/strong&gt;But do you believe in it?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUSH: &lt;/strong&gt;That God created the world, I do, yeah.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;MCFADDEN:&lt;/strong&gt; But what about ...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUSH:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I think you can have both. I think evolution can -- you're getting me way out of my lane here. I'm just a simple president.  But it's, I think that God created the Earth, created the world; I think the creation of the world is so mysterious it requires something as large as an almighty, and I don't think it's incompatible with the scientific proof that there is evolution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grand old hotel, in an increasingly progressive and prosperous India: Suddenly, hundreds of innocent, unsuspecting people are hostages, some of them being systematically murdered. Bombs are exploding, people are screaming, military are descending into the chaos, TV crews are coming from everywhere to broadcast the carnage worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it was a terrible and shocking event. However, he really doesn't &lt;i&gt;care&lt;/i&gt; about Indians suffering and dying — he wants to warn Americans that it could happen here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look around. Watch your evening news. Read your newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, Pat! I have! Where are these terrorists bombing buildings and gunning people down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you not seen the awful similarity between what happened in Mumbai and what's happening &lt;i&gt;right now in our cities?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our cities? Now? I checked the news web sites right away — they seem to have missed it. All looks quiet. Give me a better hint, Pat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I refer to California's Proposition 8. You haven't heard about the well-oiled campaign to find out the names of every voter and business that contributed as much as $1,000, or even much less, in support of Prop 8? You haven't heard about the announced plans to boycott, demonstrate, intimidate and threaten each one - because they &lt;i&gt;dared&lt;/i&gt; to vote to retain marriage as between one man and one woman? You haven't seen, on the evening news, prominent entertainers and even California Gov. Schwarzenegger, urging the demonstrators on, telling them they should "never give up" until they get their way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh, Pat, gay people aren&amp;#39;t threatening to kill anyone — they are demanding civil and judicial action. How divorced from reality are you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slavery was abolished, blacks and women obtained the rights to vote, and these true rights were not obtained by threats and violent demonstrations and civil disruption (though these things did occur, of course), but by due process, congressional deliberations and appropriate ratification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh. On Pat Boone's Alternate Earth, the Civil War never happened, and the 50s and 60s were placid periods where lawyers and politicians quietly and without fanfare enacted civil rights laws in the absence of any citizen action. How nice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What troubles me so deeply, and should trouble all thinking Americans, is that there is a real, unbroken line between the jihadist savagery in Mumbai and the hedonistic, irresponsible, blindly selfish goals and tactics of our homegrown sexual jihadists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't quite know what to say, Pat. I don't believe that the &lt;i&gt;thinking&lt;/i&gt; Americans will be troubled by your imaginary line, but perhaps the purblind ignorant ones will be…so it makes sense that you&amp;#39;re peddling this rancid tripe on WorldNutDaily.&lt;/p&gt;

She is a fantastic singer, and her songs are intelligently and lovingly written. I’ve seen her in concert a few times, and she’s wonderful. She lives in Austin, Texas, and is also very giving to the community, sponsoring projects for kids and people in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family spent Thanksgiving visiting friends in Austin, and they knew of my unrequited crush on Sara. So after some finagling, &lt;em&gt;they managed to get her to come to their house and give us a private concert!&lt;/em&gt; I was swooning the whole time, but managed to get some video. With her permission, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBk180coao"&gt;here is Sara singing one of my favorites&lt;/a&gt; (I asked her to sing this, in fact), &amp;quot;Simply&amp;quot;. It’s a love song. On the video I missed the first few seconds of her description; she’s saying she wrote this song when she was 17 and had a crush on a boy… the actual song starts about 2 minutes in, but listen to her intro since it’s delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;


&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/JXBk180coao%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a total sweetheart, even letting The Little Astronomer use her guitar and play a song she’s learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more about Sara at &lt;a href="http://www.sarahickman.com"&gt;SaraHickman.com&lt;/a&gt;. My HUGE thanks to Gennie and Bill for getting this put together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note  added after I initially wrote this: To see what else Sara is capable of — in a totally different but hauntingly beautiful way — &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViL3e-4WUi0"&gt;watch this video of hers of &amp;quot;Mad World&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Kim Poor, the organizer, just informed me that he has updated his guest list: it now includes Apollo 12 astronaut Dick Gordon, as well as Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood — the stars of the movie &amp;quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;quot;! That’s very cool. Moreover, Apollo 9 astronaut Rusty Schweickart will give a talk about how to prevent asteroid impacts, a topic he is an expert in (as people who have read my book already know). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic time at the last Spacefest (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/sets/72157603450850073/"&gt;check out my photos on Flickr!&lt;/a&gt;), and I’m really looking forward to this one. Plus, San Diego is a happening town, and I always enjoy visiting. I hope to see plenty of BABloggees there!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Phil Plait</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/feed/</id><title type="html">Bad Astronomy</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228771758477"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=891">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a8be84e9cd615aee</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Changing Times"/><title type="html">He's My BF</title><published>2008-12-08T21:21:36Z</published><updated>2008-12-08T21:21:36Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=891" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I was chatting with three of our visiting graduate students from the PRC.  Thinking that I was being au courant, I mentioned the expression DUI4XIANG4 對象 (&amp;quot;boy/girl friend&amp;quot; &amp;lt; &amp;quot;target; object&amp;quot;); I knew very well that no one would say something so creepy and out-of-date as NAN2PENG2YOU and NÜ3PENG2YOU.  But all three of them (two women and one man) simultaneously laughed and said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s so old-fashioned, Professor Mair!&amp;quot;  So I asked them, &amp;quot;What do you say now?&amp;quot;  I was amazed when they told me, &amp;quot;We just say &amp;#39;BF&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;GF&amp;#39;.&amp;quot;  Of course, I knew right away that they meant &amp;quot;boy friend&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;girl friend,&amp;quot; but I thought such usages were confined to short text messaging, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and so forth, where they are indeed extremely widespread.  What struck me is that &amp;quot;BF&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;GF&amp;quot; are part of their spoken Chinese vocabulary as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TA1 SHI4 WO3DE BF 他是我的bf ("He's my boy friend") is a perfectly good Mandarin sentence.  I suppose that one could refer to this as a kind of code-switching, but I suspect that BF and similar expressions function as assimilated Chinese terms.  Acronymic loan words?  I'm really not sure what to call them, but they certainly are prevalent in the language as spoken and written today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Victor Mair</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228769804277"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4449">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a65abd4c37ecdd4e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Skepticism"/><title type="html">Afternoon Inquisition 12.8</title><published>2008-12-08T20:53:07Z</published><updated>2008-12-08T20:53:07Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4449" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=eabf0397d6a4639a524a2211391c2d47&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, you all listened to the second Skepchick podcast (you did, didn’t you?) where we suggested great gifts for the Skepchick in your life (and ourselves, should you feel generous).

&lt;p&gt;You know, more and more I'm starting to be of the mind that perhaps marriage should not be defined by the government. After all, to the government, marriage is nothing more than a contract. Consequently, I wonder whether the government should simply issue civil contracts to any couples wanting to be married, be they straight or gay, without distinction of sexual orientation and let people for whom a religious imprimatur on their union matters go to their churches to be officially "married."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/proposition_8_the_musical.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/478810784" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228768956800"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=617">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/ba7eb0d5642bf7e1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Me Thinking So You Don't Have To"/><title type="html">A Little Better Advice</title><published>2008-12-08T14:27:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-08T14:27:00Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=617" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve read a few articles lately about startup founders advising other people whether not to start up themselves (usually not) and it’s given me a sense of déjà vu. Back when I was a B-list professional poker player I got a lot of inquiries from people I didn’t know asking me if they should go pro. A lot of other pros who were asked that question said no every time. And they weren’t really wrong to do so, because if you’re asking someone you don’t even know that question, no is at least 75% likely to be the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a very helpful one though. I realized early that people aren’t really asking you if they should go pro. They’ll make their decision regardless what you tell them, and if they got far enough along in the process to start asking, the smart money was that they were going to do it in the near future. I’d bet that the majority of them did, even though almost all of them were told not to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of just giving them a flat out no, I asked them a bunch of questions. Do you have kids to support? How much do you need to make each month to make ends meet? Do you have enough saved up to break even for three months (or six if you’re playing live) and still have a bankroll left? What’s your win rate and sample size? Yada yada yada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to help them at least realize that going pro means a hell of a lot more than just quitting your job and gambling all the time. And it even means a lot more than just being good at poker, because something like 30% of people are winning players, but only a tiny fraction of them could successfully do it for a living. Success as a professional is more about bankroll management than poker skill, and avoiding going broke is a lot harder to do well than beating a $10/$20 game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people probably ignored everything I told them anyway, just as they would had I said no (or yes for that matter, since they were going to anyway, though they’d blame me if it went badly for them). But I know I saved a few people from a lot of agony, and ended up encouraging a few who went on to have success with it. By not advising them one way or another, but rather giving them more information, I helped anyone who I could, and I at least didn’t hurt the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think startups are much the same as poker. People often ask if they should do one, but they’re not really looking for a yes or no answer. Most of them are just thinking out loud or looking for confirmation of the decision they’ve already made (or, if you say no, someone to tell “I told you so” after their IPO) but many are looking for information to help them come to their own conclusion. So you try to help the ones who might actually consider what you say and make their own informed choice, and assume the rest will ignore you anyway. Just saying no is definitely more convenient for me, but I don’t mind taking a few seconds to help someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like poker, startups can be a great way to go, you just have to be prepared and know what you’re getting into. If you’re used to steady, professional employment it’s a big change. You’re jumping out of the hot tub and into a frozen, stormy ocean. While other people might just advise staying dry, I try to give them a metaphorical wet suit and a life raft.&lt;/p&gt;

The first &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/opinion/06ayers.html?_r=1&amp;amp;em"&gt;former terrorist Bill Ayers' explanation of why he didn't respond when Obama was smeared by association&lt;/a&gt; and the second &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/07/AR2008120701925.html"&gt;P. Michael Conn and James V. Parker writing for the WaPo about the escalation in recent years of animal rights terrorism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me about both these articles is the interesting divide between how terrorists justify their behaviors and diminish their objectives of striking fear into their opponents, and the reality of what the subjects of such acts perceive.  Conn and Parker are quite right to use the label "terrorist", as even though the ALF has been unsuccessful in actually killing someone so far, they've come close, demonstrated carelessness for human life, and ultimately are using acts of violence to intimidate others into changing their behavior.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now frequently AR terrorism been downplayed in discussions on this blog as property damage, or mere economic assaults on research science.  As an example of this mentality, listen to Ayers downplay the Weather Undergrounds violent activity:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/terrorism_denialism.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/terrorism_denialism.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/478751483" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228763446701"><id gr:original-id="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=3455">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/1e88026d5a7e9525</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Uncategorized"/><category term="iPhones"/><category term="Oprah"/><category term="Wal Mart"/><title type="html">What Do the iPhone and Jonathan Franzen Have in Common?</title><published>2008-12-08T22:40:37Z</published><updated>2008-12-08T22:40:37Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FreakonomicsBlog/~3/pxWexNkiA9c/" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/08/what-do-the-iphone-and-jonathan-franzen-have-in-common/"/><summary xml:base="http://www.freakonomics.com/" type="html">Or, put another way:

You know how it goes: I put up a post for nominations, leave it to simmer for a while, it scrolls off the bottom of the page, and I lose track of it all. Then I come back and the soup is all scorched and horrible. Oh, wait, no — it&amp;#39;s fine! This internet thingie let&amp;#39;s comments sit there forever if I let it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've caught up with two months' worth of nominations, and here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For September, two awards: &lt;b&gt;Patricia&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Nick Gotts&lt;/b&gt;. Give 'em some belated applause!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For October, the winner actually got lots of votes for September, too, but if I gave her both months' awards everyone would accuse me of being lazy (which would especially sting because it would be true). So, finally, &lt;b&gt;SC&lt;/b&gt; gets the Molly for October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm all caught up, of course, it's time to collect nominations for the best commenter of November. Leave your suggestions here, and someone remind me before they all boil over this time.&lt;/p&gt;

I was just informed that Cristian Adomnitei &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education,_Research_and_Youth_(Romania)"&gt;has been replaced&lt;/a&gt;, but the article linked below didn’t mention it. If you have updated information, please leave a comment!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To most Americans, Romania may seem like some far-distant land that has nothing in common with us. However, sadly, that’s not true; they have taken a step a lot of antiscientists in America are actively trying to make happen: &lt;a href="http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/4652/46/"&gt;schools in Romania no longer teach evolution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounding much like the antiscience embarrassments that are the creationists on the Texas Board of Education, Cristian Adomnitei, the Romanian Minister of Education, said this incredibly Orwellian thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This subject can be found implicitly from middle school to high-school… Do you think that the studies about the world where we live, its evolution or genetics can ignore the evolution theory? This is impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t actually &lt;strong&gt;teach&lt;/strong&gt; the topic, then your definition of the word &amp;quot;ignore&amp;quot; must be different than mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, not everyone in Romania is satisfied with either this policy of the Education Minister:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Remus Cernea, president of Solidarity for Freedom of Conscience, is unimpressed by the Ministry’s position on implicit learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can the evolution theory be implicit?” Cernea says. “The evolution theory is either present in the curriculum and in the text books and is studied by everybody, or not present in the curriculum and nobody studies it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Education Minister’s position is so artfully dumb that I suspect that it will be eagerly incorporated by creationists here in the States. I can imagine the reasoning: &amp;quot;By &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; teaching science, we are &lt;em&gt;implicitly&lt;/em&gt; teaching science. We teach the students everything &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; science, and they can figure out what science is by looking at the gaps!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me that’s no more crazy than what we have heard coming out of Kansas, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Dover…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know America doesn’t have a strangle hold on antiscientific nonsense that could eventually destroy the next generation of scientists we produce. But this is one particular export that simply carries too high a tariff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romania, you need to wise up, literally. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C5%9Fescu"&gt;Nicolae Ceauşescu&lt;/a&gt; may be gone, but that doesn’t mean everything will be milk and honey after that. And that’s an analogous object lesson to us in the States as well: just because we are getting rid of the worst antiscience President we have ever had does not mean that we can let our vigilance slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So until they see toward what a disaster they are headed:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(There’s a chance you didn’t know at one point, but once you learned, you manipulated time in order to return to a point in the past that would effectively mean you always knew.) In the spirit of the holiday, I thought I’d post to let you all know that I have arrived here from December 8, 2012, where the world population waits terrified in anticipation of the end of everything, as predicted by the Mayans. (You can learn more about it &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.december212012.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) I have traveled through time carrying a desperate warning, and a plea for help. Please, read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/12/Hoy_botnb.jpg" alt="Nuclear Baby" width="250" height="334"&gt;I talked about some end-of-the-world scenarios &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=1515"&gt;on Skepchick before&lt;/a&gt;, and we talked about the specific absurdity of the 2012 end-of-days theory on &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=133"&gt;The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe back in February of 2008&lt;/a&gt; (”this year,” to you non-time travelers), but to recap: the Mayans were pretty brainy people, but nothing they ever did would suggest they had the power to predict the end of all life as we know it. See, they kept track of time using different calendars, one of which is known today as the Long Count Calendar. Like our calendar year, everything was referenced in terms of cycles, and the end of a cycle also meant it was the beginning of the next cycle. That changeover was a really great excuse to party, kind of like how &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; party at the end of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; annual cycle by paying a ridiculous cover charge to get into an otherwise cruddy bar where we’re given a thimble of cheap sparkling wine, which we drink and then make-out awkwardly with some guy we just met because god damn it it’s New Year’s and we’ll be damned if we’re going to spend it alone like last year, crying into a tub of ice cream and passing out in front of Dick Clark at 10:30pm. I mean, I guess some people might celebrate like that. In your time. Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point being that in all likelihood, not even the Mayans thought the world would end on December 21, 2012. It’s yet another apocalyptic fantasy made up by New Age crackpots with so much time on their hands that they need to pretend that time is running out faster than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, you are probably wondering why I, as an accomplished time traveler, have fled from December of 2012 in order to take up residence back here in 2008. After all, if the Mayans didn’t actually predict the world would end that month, why would I want to leave a time known for peace, prosperity, and ten to twenty more cupcakes a day than what humans averaged in 2008? Well, it’s simple . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . the New Age crackpots are driving me &lt;em&gt;nuts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve come to 2008 with a plea for your help. I need you – all of you – to help prevent a future of crackpots crying nonstop about the end of the world, with a hundred times more shrillness than any of those panicking over Y2K. Tell your friends! Your family! The world! Tell them to please stop getting all their information on the time-keeping habits of ancient civilizations from poorly designed web pages and emails with subject lines that read “Fwd: FW: FW: FW: FW: Fwd: END OF WORLD PERDICTED BY MYANS!!!!” Please. The future depends upon it. My sanity depends upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+++++++++++&lt;/p&gt;

As the producer and one of the co-hosts of SGU 5×5, I have not felt this level of pride about something I’ve worked on in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one set of feelings to be able to play a smaller part of a much greater project, such as our primary podcast, The Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe. That in itself carries a great deal of weight and a great sense of accomplishment. But in the most honest assessment, it is but a mere and limited contribution in the light of what Steven Novella has accomplished as producer, host, and editor of The SGU. To be a part of Steve’s show has been the highlight of my career in skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, when all of us on The SGU were talking about new projects and fresh approaches for 2008, we unanimously decided that we needed to produce a second podcast. It was rather clear and apparent what our new podcast had to be. Just about all of the other top science podcasts in the world, such as those being produced by NASA, National Geographic, Discovery, and Scientific American, had multiple podcasts available, with more on the way. If we were going to try and “keep up with the Jones’” to some extent (at least as much as a small group of friends doing this as a hobby can accomplish), we had to come up with a new show. Fortunately, there were already a few things working in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the other top science podcasts had multiple shows, none of them were as long as The SGU. That meant we would need to produce a shorter show. If we had a shorter show to begin with, and tried to come up with a much longer second show, that would have been a big mountain to climb. In addition to show duration working on our side, we did not have to re-invent the wheel. The model for success had already been established with The SGU. We would use the same cast and the same, open, roundtable format. All we had to do was to shrink it down into a “bite-sized” nugget covering a single skeptical topic, and presto, we have a new podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else that was determined from the get-go was that Steve had no additional time to produce another podcast. It was incumbent on one of us to take control as the producer and editor of this new show. The combination of my pride in our work with The SGU and our collective desire to keep The SGU moving forward motivated me to volunteer to produce the new show. I would be responsible for coming up with the topics, scheduling the recording time, collecting all the files, and editing the show. All Steve would have to do is give the final stamp of approval and upload the file. I would have a small taste, and an even greater appreciation, for what Steve does every week for an 80 minute show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we needed a title. We agreed that the show should be around five minutes in length, and we had already agreed that the podcast would be the five of us participating on each episode. The moniker ‘five by five’ was a natural fit. It was short, catchy, and had the added bonus of being a phrase used by the dropship pilot, Ferro, in the movie ‘Aliens’ to report that the drop is proceeding as planned. And you know us – we can’t let a perfectly good science-fiction catch phrase go unused. And “five by five” is also another way of saying “a-ok.” It was a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGU 5×5 started out as a discussion on a weekly news item, much like we do each week on The SGU. After several weeks of following this format, we decided to move a bit laterally and go with more generic topics of discussion, such as discussing the basics of skepticism in our ‘Skepticism-101’ series, or our breakdown and discussion of individual logical fallacies. Given the feedback from our listeners, this slight shift has been a positive adjustment. SGU 5×5 is a favorite amongst teachers in the classrooms. Its five minute format is a good, unencumbered piece to present in a classroom, and it needs no editing for such an environment, as we have produced SGU 5×5 so that it will always be appropriate for all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGU 5×5 is a supplement podcast to The SGU. In addition to all the reasons we wanted a second podcast, one thing not to be overlooked is that we wanted SGU 5×5 to also bring in more listeners to The SGU. It was targeted to those who, for whatever reason, did not want, or felt they couldn’t listen to an 80 minute show. I have found SGU 5×5 to be a great means of introducing people to skepticism. When people ask me what I do in skepticism, I tell them to just take 5 minutes of their time and listen to an episode to get a taste. Apparently, this approach has drawn the attention of the folks who run the podcast universe over at iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s iTunes is a funny thing. It is without a doubt the center of the podcast universe, rightfully so, as podcasting was born out of Apple’s iPod genesis and genius. About 80 percent of The SGU and SGU 5×5 episodes are downloaded through iTunes. As any producers do, we try to keep track of the statistics and data about our number of downloads, where people are downloading from, and the demographics of the listeners. The SGU is a regular top-10 podcast in the iTunes ‘Science and Medicine’ category. We enjoy a weekly audience of 45,000 listeners, and of all of the excellent skeptic-themed science podcasts that are available, iTunes rates The SGU the highest skpetic-themed podcast on a day-to-day basis. I mention this not to gloat, but rather, to make an honest observation about iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the summer of this year, iTunes, quite unexpectedly, decided to make SGU 5×5 a feature podcast on the iTunes store cover page. At the same time, SGU 5×5 ranking on iTunes shot up from our regular rating (which hovers roughly between 20 and 40 on any given day) to the #3 position in Science and Medicine. It shot up to #2 for audio-only podcasts in that category, and perhaps the most surprising was that  SGU 5×5 was ranked as the #48 podcast of all podcasts, covering ALL genres. For a full week, we were heavily promoted by iTunes, and vaulted to higher positions in the rankings. As much as we were thrilled with the attention and love we received from iTunes for SGU 5×5, it left us scratching our heads a bit wondering why. The SGU download numbers were, and still are, much greater than SGU 5×5. So it wasn’t just a matter of the number of downloads. There seemed to have been a more complicated formula that the folks at iTunes used to determine their rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fired an email off to iTunes to hopefully begin a dialogue with them, so I could get a better sense of how iTunes works and comes up with their rankings. I did not get a response. But I have come to determine a few things about iTunes over the last several months of paying attention to our activity in their system. First, the number of downloads is probably their leading indicator as to how to rank the podcasts. Scientific American was good enough to share with us some numbers on their downloads, and the numbers seem to correlate accordingly with iTunes rankings. Second, the folks at iTunes have it within their personal judgment to promote whatever they want, whenever they want. If a podcast tickles the fancy of someone at iTunes, that podcast will benefit. Apparently, SGU 5×5 has done just that. Which gets back to my point about the show length and trying to get new people interested in skepticism with a short-n-sweet show to offer them. This formula has definitely struck a cord with some people at iTunes. The combination of their promotion of SGU 5×5 in the summer, along with the honor of being named one of their top 25 audio podcasts in 2008 (not just in Science and Medicine – it is all podcasts in all genres) is an extremely thrilling and humbling validation that we have met one of our primary goals in 2008, with honors. So to those at iTunes that might be reading this blog, thank you so much for the recognition you have bestowed on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, to those at iTunes, please understand that if it were not for The SGU and its 45,000+ listeners and the success that we have achieved through these raw numbers, there would probably be no SGU 5×5. As I like to remind people on The SGU, our listeners are what keep us motivated and active in producing more and better content.

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Speaking of modified brand names, this is a good place to recall that the washing stuff &amp;quot;Dreft&amp;quot; -a purely arbitrary name- was at first coined as Drek, until somebody at P&amp;amp;G realized that this is the Yiddish word for s**t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, these stories about cross-language branding disasters generally turn out to be urban legends. I dissected one of them a few months ago, dealing with the alleged fate of the Ford Pinto brand in Brazil ("&lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=619"&gt;The Factoid Acquisition Device&lt;/a&gt;"). And we've discussed a number of other such legends over the years, with the result so that I've come to wonder whether any of the language-related stories that marketing professors tell their students are ever true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this morning, purely as an academic exercise, I decided to spend a few minutes looking into the legend of Dreft and Dreck.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merri didn&amp;#39;t invent this story — it&amp;#39;s out there, in one version or another, both in the blogosphere and in at least two published books. Thus in a recent blog post (&amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.innergeek.us/blog/index.php?s=dreft"&gt;Today is Cyber Monday. Wait, whaaaaa?&lt;/a&gt;" 12/1/2008), we read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In 2005, the National Retail Federation decided to call the Monday after Thanksgiving “Cyber Monday.” It’s supposed to symbolize a busy day for online retailers and be their promotional equivalent to the brick-and-mortar stores’ Black Friday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;However. The name? Would not have been my first choice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Didn’t anyone tell the NRF that “cyber” as a verb means “to have cybersex?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Or did they hire the same marketing consultants who originally gave Procter &amp;amp; Gamble’s “Dreft” detergent the name “Dreck” without realizing that it was a Yiddish word for garbage?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a &lt;a href="http://ruthie-zaftig.blogspot.com/2007/04/mini-language-lesson.html?showComment=1177700940000#c5435670387833660325"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on a blog post from 4/26/2007 about Yiddish vocabulary, we get a slightly different version of the story, in which Dreck was the name of a follow-up product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Years ago, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble had success with Drene (shampoo) and Dreft (detergent. So based upon brand recognition, they created Drek. They pulled the name after trying to sell to the first Jewish wholesaler in Chicago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href="http://www.scienceinthebox.com/en_UK/publications/beginningsofprocter_en.html"&gt;apparently true&lt;/a&gt; that P&amp;amp;G introduced Dreft in 1933 and Drene in 1934; but I haven&amp;#39;t been able to find any evidence that the company actually marketed or even contemplated a follow-up &amp;quot;Dreck&amp;quot;. A joke to this effect must have been independently invented many times from the 1930s onward, and such jokes are often re-interpreted as history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Google Books, the "Dreft-was-originally-Dreck" version of the legend can be found in Charles Merle Crawford and C. Anthony Di Benedetto, &lt;em&gt;New Products Management&lt;/em&gt;, 1999, on &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fuO2AAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;q=dreft+dreck&amp;amp;dq=dreft+dreck&amp;amp;pgis=1"&gt;p. 377&lt;/a&gt;. The "snippet view" gives enough information to allow me to reconstruct this passage of advice on choosing a new brand name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Conduct interviews with users to screen the list down. Ask what the brands on your list mean. This is the stage where P&amp;amp;G caught Dreck (Yiddish and German definitions included garbage and body waste), so it was changed to Dreft. When down to less than 10 candidates, get a legal check on their availability and …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawford and Di Benedetto were not the first to tell this story. Google books also turns up a passage in Stephen Birmingham, &lt;em&gt;The Golden Dream: Suburbia in the Seventies&lt;/em&gt;, 1978. p. 47. This time I was not able to recover the complete passage, but with in internal ellipsis, it reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;Advertising plans, layouts, and schedules were drawn up to present Dreck to the American … Hastily, the name of the new soap powder was changed to Dreft. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I tell, though, neither book gives any source for the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.uk.pg.com/products/products/dreft.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia article on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreft"&gt;Dreft&lt;/a&gt; takes the lexicographical influence back in the other direction, asserting that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;The term "dreft" has entered the vernacular as a synonym for feces, as newborns tend to produce copious amounts of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the article offers no evidence for this assertion, and I haven't been able to find any genuine examples of the alleged vernacular usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One additional aspect of the situation is indicated by this &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnA91nr1s6A"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt;, said to be from 1937 (for showing in cinemas), which underlines the fact that Dreft was then marketed as a dishwashing detergent. It's not clear to me whether it was simultaneously marketed as a laundry detergent, or if the laundry applications came later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, my verdict on the Dreft/Dreck legend is &amp;quot;not proven&amp;quot;. (If you have any evidence to add, please supply it in the comments section — there&amp;#39;s no prohibition against double jeopardy for urban legends.)  I certainly haven&amp;#39;t shown that cross-language marketing stories are always false, but neither have I found that they are &lt;strike&gt;ever&lt;/strike&gt; very often true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[To avoid any possible offense, let me stipulate there really is an Iranian detergent named "&lt;a href="http://www.iran-export.com/Exporter/company/PAXAN/detergnt.htm"&gt;Barf&lt;/a&gt;", and LH's explanation of the name is certainly true. But whatever issues this may have raised in other countries, the &lt;a href="http://www.iran-export.com/Exporter/company/PAXAN/index.htm"&gt;Paxan&lt;/a&gt; company has not felt the need to change its brand.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228750780027"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-6957249028470543527">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/e1b4fec1b69608c7</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Blogging" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">Calling fellow bloggers!</title><published>2008-12-08T12:35:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-08T12:40:25Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/zboIeNjeLJM/calling-fellow-bloggers.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=6957249028470543527" title="3 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/12/calling-fellow-bloggers.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">Calling fellow bio bloggers -- help get the word out for the special issue of &lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/span&gt; all about eye evolution.

These people don't seem to pay much attention to what comes out of their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The No. 1 thing is, we want the state of Washington and the governor to represent everyone in the state,"&lt;/span&gt; said the Rev. Kenneth Hutcherson, the pastor of Antioch Bible Church in Redmond. &lt;span&gt;"But just because you must represent everyone in the state doesn't mean that you put up with intolerance from the people that you represent."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please tear down the sign representing the views of atheists in Washington! Silly man. And if he's complaining that the atheist sign says mean things about religion, how does he explain this information from a little later in the story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being stolen and returned, the atheists' sign is now cordoned off in an upstairs hallway next to the bust of George Washington, a &lt;b&gt;sign from Hutcherson's church mocking the atheists' sign&lt;/b&gt;, a traditional nativity display and two other religious signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds like the signs are proliferating. With any luck, the state will realize that all this noise about a holiday is entirely inappropriate, and kick the whole bickering lot of them out. I&amp;#39;d be fine with that — keep the government secular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's leave the final word in tolerance and fair representation of all view to State Rep. Jim Dunn, who also spoke out at the rally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It is time to chase out of the house of God all the unbelievers and evildoers,"&lt;/span&gt; Dunn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/irony_alert_1.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/478510495" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228749738478"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/full_service_island.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e8abffb89cb8fe4</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Personal"/><title type="html">Full Service Island</title><published>2008-12-08T14:24:23Z</published><updated>2008-12-08T14:24:23Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/478510498/full_service_island.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/full_service_island.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;A quick note of thanks to the &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2219642055"&gt;UCF chapter of the Campus Freethought Alliance&lt;/a&gt; for the pleasant time in Florida (especially pleasant now that I've come home to the prospect of several inches of snow today).

It used to be much smaller, but in recent years has gotten a huge surge from covering those topics in TV and movies, and now some pretty big stars show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/badastronomy/3085075981/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3098/3085075981_9ca5bf2ba4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was totally chuffed to score almost front-row seats at a panel for the TV show &amp;quot;The Big Bang Theory&amp;quot;. The panel was moderated by my close personal friend Adam Savage™, and featured both executive producers Chuck Lorre and (&lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/25/comic-con-day-2/#comment-106531"&gt;sometime BABloggee&lt;/a&gt;) Bill Prady, and the &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was incredibly funny, and one of the major highlights of the con for me. I taped the whole thing, and I suspect it’s OK to put up some short snippets, especially since &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/11/17/the-big-bang-theory-back-on-the-air/"&gt;I’ve been pimping the show&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve made three short clips, and I’ll put one up each morning. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl7kQMDcvqw"&gt;This first one&lt;/a&gt; has the intro of everyone, then a very funny segment with Jim Parsons, who plays the incredibly OCD Sheldon, talking about science. You may recognize the voice of the lout who shouts something out at 5:30 in.&lt;/p&gt;

If you'll recall, DCA is a small molecule drug that was used to treat congenital lactic acidosis in children through its inhibition of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. This inhibition shifts the metabolism of glucose towards oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria and away from glycolysis, the product of which is lactic acid. In January 2007, Dr. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta had the clever idea of using DCA to target the Warburg effect in tumors and published an article in Cancer Cell describing preclinical experiments in rats in which DCA resulted in marked shrinkage of multiple tumor types. The Warburg effect was first described in 1928 by Otto Warburg and refers to the tendency of many tumors to rely on glycolysis for their energy supply rather than oxidative phosphorylation, even in the presence of oxygen, which in the case of normal cells favors oxidative metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because DCA is a small molecule and relatively easy to synthesize, however, a pesticide salesman named &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/cse?cx=017254414699180528062%3Auyrcvn__yd0&amp;amp;q=tassano+site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fscienceblogs.com%2Finsolence%2F&amp;amp;sa=Search"&gt;Jim Tassano&lt;/a&gt; decided that he would&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/02/slumming_around_the_dca_site_thedcasitec.php"&gt; sell "pet DCA" to treat cancer in pets&lt;/a&gt;. Tassano fooled no one, of course; the real purpose was to take advantage of desperate cancer patients, some of whom &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/02/slumming_around_the_dca_site_thedcasitec.php"&gt;flocked to his BuyDCA.com website&lt;/a&gt; to purchase what he claimed to be pharmaceutical grade DCA. It also led to a most disturbing phenomenon, namely &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/dichloroacetate_self-medication.php"&gt;self-experimentation by desperate cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; with DCA and discussion among patients on online forums, which was even likened to "clinical trials," complete with reports of success based on &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/03/dichloroacetate_dca_and_cancer_magical_t.php"&gt;magical thinking&lt;/a&gt; more than anything else. This observation led me to take interest in the more general &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/02/drug_safety_versus_a_constitutional_righ.php"&gt;question of the "right" of patient access to experimental drugs&lt;/a&gt; versus the &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/cancer_in_the_wall_street_journal.php"&gt;negative effect that such unrestricted access&lt;/a&gt; would have on clinical trials. Last year, the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2007/08/cancer_in_the_wall_street_journal.php"&gt;reversed an earlier decision&lt;/a&gt; by its own three-judge panel and ruled 8-2 against a patient's right to have access to any experimental therapy. I thought things were fairly settled then, but apparently not, as this &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97536831"&gt;recent story&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/patientled_clinical_trials_versus_clinic.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/patientled_clinical_trials_versus_clinic.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/478456920" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228743589234"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/godless_charities.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/45f2a3cf4bd45636</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Godless charities</title><published>2008-12-08T13:09:45Z</published><updated>2008-12-08T13:09:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/478446433/godless_charities.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/godless_charities.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;At one of my talks this weekend, I was asked if there was a list of secular charities somewhere…and alas, I didn&amp;#39;t have one off the top of my head.

This week I will discuss what is perhaps our greatest victory to date – our vigilant campaign against creationist incursions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one issue nicely illustrates many of the points I made in Part I of this series any may even provide a road map forward for some of our other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Brief History of Creationism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various forms of creationism, including its most recent incarnation in so-called Intelligent Design, are really just evolution denial. The theory of evolution has been culturally controversial since it was formally proposed by Darwin and Wallace in 1859. it is not hard to imagine why, it shattered one of the pillars of the human ego - that we are something more than animals, than the accidental products of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Evolution also flew in the face of religious dogma, at a time when the institutions of science were very much in the ascendancy. While some religious sects accommodated the advance of science, others did not. In the US, certain fundamentalist Christian sects chose to draw their line in the sand at evolution. Evolution became “evilution” – the enemy, the cause of all evil in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the scientific controversy over evolution was rather brief, lasting a few decades at most. The fossil, genetic, developmental, geological and biological evidence quickly piled up in favor of the various aspects of Darwin’s theory: common descent, change over time, and natural selection acting on variation as the dominant mechanism (I will heretofore refer to these collectively simply as evolution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while scientists were quickly convinced by the evidence, the public was not. This disconnect continues to the present day. Greater than 98% of working scientists accept evolution as established fact, while less than 50% of the public does. Scientific understanding of the processes and history of evolution has advanced incredibly, and the modern synthesis of evolution is a rich, subtle, elegant, and beautiful theory. Meanwhile the public understanding of evolution is stuck on the 150 year-old basic concepts of survival of the fittest and branching descent. I doubt any significant portion of the public can give a cogent definition of punctuated equilibrium, coaptation, homology, or mechanisms of speciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most skeptics are familiar with the litany of creationist assaults on the teaching of evolution in public schools – the primary battleground of this particular issue. The evolution-creationism conflict is all about what gets taught to students in school, and what goes into their textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news for the US is that creationism has been a bigger problem here than in any other Western country. The good news, however, is that we also have a powerful weapon against it – the First Amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing the separation of church and state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began with laws that flat-out banned the teaching of evolution and favored the teaching of biblical creationism. Creationists tried to simply legislate a victory that they could not have scientifically. Tennessee’s version of this law was the Butler Bill, which stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“unlawful for any teacher in any of the. . . public schools. . .to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This law was challenged in the famous Scopes trial of 1926. John Scopes was found guilty of teaching evolution, but his conviction was thrown out on appeal on a technicality. This was a defeat, however, for the defenders of evolution because it meant that the law would not be challenged at the state or federal Supreme Court level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-evolution laws remained on the books for the next several decades, and generations of Americans were simply not taught about the central theory of biology. Anti-evolution laws were eventually declared unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in the Epperson vs Arkansas case of 1962.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to the “creation science” movement. Creationism could not be taught in public schools because it is religious faith, so proponents simply renamed it “creation science” and lobbied for laws demanding equal time for creation science alongside evolution. They got 25 years out of this strategy, but then in 1987 equal time laws for creation science were declared unconstitutional in the Edwards vs Aguillard decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for another rebranding. “Creation science” became “Intelligent Design” with a literal cut and paste of these terms in creationist texts. Creationists wanted another go at the “equal time” argument, but this time with the words “God” and “creation” purged from their text. They also changed “equal time” to “teach the controversy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy failed its first legal test in 2005 in the Kitzmiller vs Dover case. Judge John E. Jones III essentially concluded that the ID proponents were not fooling anyone. Even though their rhetoric may be more subtle and sophisticated than the blatant Butler Bill, their intent was exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are into the next phase of this apparently never-ending game. Creationists are now claiming that they are really for academic freedom – which is just another way of saying they want equal time to teach the controversy. It’s ironic that the creationist movement began by banning the teaching of an accepted scientific theory, and now are whining about being oppressed and all they ever really wanted was academic freedom. Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also appears that the next phase will take the battle beyond evolution itself. ID proponents in particular have identified the enemy not just as evolution, but as materialism – the philosophical underpinnings of science itself (the stakes are indeed high). Next on the hit list of materialist science is neuroscience – the study of mind and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battlegrounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several battlegrounds in this debate. One is the textbook industry. After the Scopes trial, evolution became too controversial for science textbook publishers, so they removed the “E” word from their books. This battle was lost for almost the rest of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. While evolution started to creep back into textbooks after 1962, the quality was abysmal. It is only recently, perhaps the last 20 years, that most biology textbooks approach a decent treatment of evolution (at least compared to their treatment of science in general, which in my opinion is unacceptably poor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another battleground is the legislature. This battleground has seen one tactical loss in the Scope trial, but ever since then we have had a string of unmitigated victories. Whenever laws meddling in the teaching of science come before the higher courts, the First Amendment has prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is for this reason, in fact, that creationists have tried to change the battleground to the local level. They started fighting at the level of the school board and at the state level with the science standards. In this arena there has been a mix of victory and defeat. Creationists can pack a school board or department of education committee, and get their anti-evolution agendas passed. Sometimes public attention reverses the trend and rational standards are reinstated. But this continues to be a raging battle with no definitive victory on either side. We are seeing this play out now in Texas over the state science standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, perhaps the most important battleground – the mind of the public. The consensus of various surveys indicates that we are not doing well here. Less than half the public accepts evolution as an established scientific fact, and this number has not changed much over the last half century. It’s not clear exactly what to make of this. Perhaps this is a battle we cannot win – to the faithful, faith will always trump science. As long as fundamentalists are preaching lies about evolution from the pulpit, it may not matter what gets taught in the science classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, perhaps there has simply not been enough time. Improved evolution teaching may take generations to have a significant effect, and we have not achieved that goal yet. Evolution is still not being taught adequately, if at all, in many school districts. Meanwhile, the science of evolution is steadily advancing. In the long run I think that will count for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evolution of Evolution Defenders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story behind this story is that the skeptical movement had played, and continues to play, a central role in defending evolution from its deniers. The mainstream scientific community correctly perceived the threat from creationism, but they did not have the tools necessary to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps best encapsulated by Duane Gish, a “creation scientist” who made a career going around the country debating biologists and evolutionary scientists in public. Most of the scientists who squared off against Gish got their clocks cleaned. They naively believed that because they were right – because they had science on their side – that they could easily win. They actually thought that being right was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were not sufficiently familiar with the specific claims of the creationists, the ways in which they distort science, the half-truths they tell about the findings of science, and the subtle (and not-so-subtle) logical fallacies they commit to throw doubt upon science. They also did not understand the nature and pitfalls of public debate itself. They got blind-sided. They became stooges for Gish’s traveling show. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As a side note, many of you likely know that our own Michael Shermer debated Gish. He did as well as can be expected, but even he learned a few lessons from the experience – mainly that open debate is an inherently disadvantageous setting for the side of science. It falls victim to the infamous “Gish Gallop” – in which lies and misconceptions are thrown out in such great number that you can never deal with them all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who came to the rescue and truly held the front lines of this battle, were skeptics and science popularizers. Those who spent their time explaining science to the public understood best how creationists were manipulating the public perception of evolution. Stephen J. Gould, for example, was key to the 1987 Edwards vs Aguillard victory. Since then other science popularizers, like Kenneth Miller, have played a central role. The most popular science blog is Pharyngula by PZ Myers – a developmental biologist who takes on the creationists at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course Eugenie Scott took up the banner of evolution full time with the &lt;a href="http://ncseweb.org/"&gt;National  Center for Science Education&lt;/a&gt;. She has been an effective watch dog on creationist shenanigans – she is like a general, sending in troops whenever skirmishes break out at the local level. The NCSE performed a Herculean task, organizing the expert testimony for evolution during the Kitzmiller vs Dover trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize that these people and institutions are not simply extensions of mainstream science. They are skeptics, either all-purpose or specialists in the creation-evolution issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more is that the skeptical community has done an outstanding job of dissecting every last creationist argument and pointing out in detail all misstatements of fact and logical fallacies. They have not only understood the tactics used by creationists, but even started anticipating their next moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptics have also done a great job of educating mainstream scientists about creationism. I recently interviewed Steven Schafersman of Texans for Science and Reason for the &lt;a href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=175"&gt;Skeptics’s Guide podcast&lt;/a&gt;. He has been on the front line for decades, and he reports that 20 years ago he was the lone skeptical voice fighting in Texas. When scientists were called upon to give testimony before the school board, they generally did not understand the arguments of creationists, they often argued past them, and basically didn’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the recent hearings for the Texas science standards, however, his experience has been totally different. Scientists and even students are making cogent on-target arguments. They have the creationist arguments nailed. And they understand how to explain this to non-scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the skeptical community has actually managed to educate the mainstream scientific community about creationism, how to combat it, and the importance of defending science in the public arena. Maybe that’s partly why ID proponents are shifting their efforts to neuroscience – they want a naïve specialty to go after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this post I characterized creationism as perhaps our greatest victory. And yet I also described that we have had a mixture of victories and defeats on the various battlegrounds of this issue, and have made little progress in the ultimate goal of changing public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I maintain my former claim because on this issue the skeptical movement has discovered how to be successful. We have formed dedicated watchdog organizations, we have websites and books to serve as detailed references, and we have learned the tactics of our opponents and actually try to counter them, rather than just naively playing into them. We have clearly defined the relevant battle lines, and have strategies to deal with them. We can mobilize the troops at a moments notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more importantly, we have fully partnered with the mainstream scientific community and have even trained them how to be good skeptics and science popularizers on this issue – or at least they understand their value. And within academia, otherwise ivory-tower academics know exactly what you mean when you bring up the issue of creationist incursions into science education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much work ahead – but we are winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I will discuss what is currently our greatest failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snapped this on my cell phone camera while I was home in Oregon for Thanksgiving.  This doesn’t seem to happen in Berkeley for some reason (perhaps we’re hopeless), but in several other places when I have been to large football games, several groups of protestors/preachers will be standing near the entrances with signs and megaphones yelling at people that the end is coming, repent or go to hell, homosexuality is a sin, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case I was attending the Civil War game between the Oregon State University Beavers and the University of Oregon Ducks.  The Beavers, from Corvallis, my home town, were poised to go to the Rose Bowl for the first time in 44 years if they could just beat the arch-nemesis Ducks.  Many people carried roses into the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on the way in, this girl and her father were holding signs (not shouting for once) and passing out literature.  I asked permission from the father (and the girl) to take the photo; the father agreed as long as I took some of the literature.  It’s a great photo for anyone wondering why creationism continues to persist in the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not repent of evolution, and the Beavers and their Rose Bowl hopes were mercilessly crushed, at home, 65-38.  Correlation or causation?  We report, you decide.&lt;/p&gt;

That kind of writing can be self-important, insipid, and boring.  But it can also have real power.  A number of the anonymous bloggers here describe the intersection of the scientific life and family life with powerful relevance.  Still, that's not my talent, and I don't do it much.  One of my med school classmates, when I showed him one of my first pieces, said, "that's good, Pal, but how do you &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt;?"  That has always stuck with me (thanks, S!), and it's in that spirit, and not the spirit of &lt;i&gt;kvetching&lt;/i&gt;, that I'd like you to know that doctors are human.  Yeah, I know, no surprise there, but still, sometimes patients forget it, and more important, sometimes doctors forget it.  Besides, since no one reads the blogs on Sunday, it's a good day for self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come from a family of very smart people.  &lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; smart---sometimes I feel like the village idiot (but in the best possible way).  They are intellectually active professionals, all have advanced degrees, and many of them are musicians as well.  Along with smarts, my family has been endowed with some unusual medical problems, so even the non-medical folks have used their formidable intellects to learn a little medicine.  These are not "google scholars"---these are the real thing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when my family challenges me about my skepticism, I have to take it seriously, not just because they're my family and I love them, but because unlike some of the vacuous trolls that  haunt this site, they're very smart and well-informed.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a number of good friends and family members with cancer.  Is my hypertrophied skeptical sense depriving me of sharing with them "other ways of healing"?  My sister, who is pretty good at reminding me that I don't actually know &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;, challenged me pretty rigorously on my medical skepticism.  Of course, my wife and cousin had to help her out.  These aren't garden-variety challenges to my beliefs.  A random blog troll can bring up the same &lt;i&gt;canards&lt;/i&gt; and fallacies over and over, but when the people you love use good reasoning and good knowledge to call you out, you gotta take it a little more seriously.  When the people you love have nasty diseases, it's got that much more &lt;i&gt;gravitas&lt;/i&gt;.  Those of us who devote our intellectual resources to science-based medicine are often accused of lacking compassion, a charge I try very hard to avoid, not because it's false (and it is), but because compassion is the great immeasurable, the &lt;i&gt;ars longa&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;vita brevis&lt;/i&gt;.  Without compassion, science-based medicine might as well hand over the keys to the &lt;i&gt;reiki&lt;/i&gt; shamans, the homeopaths, and other smiling quacks, because no matter how &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; you are, a doctor who lacks compassion can't be an effective healer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/why_am_i_here_again.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/12/why_am_i_here_again.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DenialismBlog/~4/477969666" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/index.xml</id><title type="html">denialism blog</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228685114535"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/the_real_bozo_attempts_to_aton.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2a9a66fc329cda6d</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="MarkCC's Errors"/><title type="html">The Real Bozo Attempts to Atone: Why the DDWFTW Car Works</title><published>2008-12-07T19:54:45Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T19:54:45Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~3/477792253/the_real_bozo_attempts_to_aton.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/the_real_bozo_attempts_to_aton.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="html">&lt;span&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/ddwftw" rel="tag"&gt;ddftw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/bozos" rel="tag"&gt;bozos&lt;/a&gt;,
 &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/markcc-screwups" rel="tag"&gt;markcc-screwups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So, as I said in the edit to my previous post about the wind-driven cart, I
seriously blew it. The folks who pointed out the similarity of the cart to a tacking
sailboat were absolutely correct. The guys who built this cart, and recorded the demo
were &lt;em&gt;absolutely right&lt;/em&gt;, and I was stupidly wrong, in multiple ways. First of
all, I thought this was a really simple system. I couldn't possibly be more wrong
about that - this is anything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; simple; in fact, it's a remarkably
interesting and elegant demonstration of how complicated and counterintuitive fluid
dynamics can be. Second, I completely misunderstood the simple mechanics of the
device; I originally thought that the propellor was spinning in the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt;
direction - and I completely missed it when people repeatedly tried to explain that
error to me. And third, I completely screwed up my own mathematical model of how
something like this works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So - to repeat: the guys who did the demo of this are clearly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bozos; the only bozo in this situation is me, for screwing it up so badly, on so many levels. I sincerely apologize for calling them bozos and mocking them. I made a whole series of really stupid errors, and took an unreasonably long time to recognize that fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It should be &lt;em&gt;obvious&lt;/em&gt; that there's some way to go downwind faster than the
wind, because as so many people pointed out, sailboats do it. It was frankly
stupid of me to even argue about this - it's really pretty boneheadedly obvious. The question never should have been "can it be done?", but rather just "does this device do it?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And the answer to that is "Yes". This thing does do it. It's not magic, it's not perpetual motion. In fact, it's really astonishingly simple, once you realize that the behavior of things moving through air is quite different from the simple rigid system that it appears to be equivalent to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In this post, I'm going to try to do two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Explain the faulty reasoning that led me to think it couldn't work,
		and why it's wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Explain why the thing really works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In another post later this week, I'm going to try to explain why I think the
mathematical element is so important. There's a ton of people who've got devices that
really &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; convincing, and that have really convincing arguments for why
they should work; only they don't, because they've missed something. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/the_real_bozo_attempts_to_aton.php"&gt;Read the rest of this post...&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/12/the_real_bozo_attempts_to_aton.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/CyKN/~4/477792253" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Good Math, Bad Math</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228684221489"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/07/extermiknit-part-ii/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/da3a1ffe4262dbf6</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="SciFi"/><category term="TV/Movies"/><title type="html">Extermiknit Part II</title><published>2008-12-07T21:07:57Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T21:07:57Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/07/extermiknit-part-ii/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;So you have a Dalek on your holiday gift list, but what to get the genetically mutated Universe-dominating alien? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were just lining the sidewalk at the entrance to the hall where I spoke, silently playing with their rosary beads. We invited them in, but none bothered — they quietly disappeared sometime around the time it started. We also had a couple of security guards sitting in the back of the room, whether to make sure the rowdy atheists didn&amp;#39;t do something evil or to protect us from the fierce horde of prayerful Catholics, I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

His post was about speaker identification (or nationality/ethnicity of speaker), so I’m stretching things a bit here, but whether the evidence is spoken or written, the process of narrowing down a list of suspects, much less finding the right one, has many of the same problems.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in all science, effective diagnosis begins with adequate comparative data. In authorship identification cases, the first problem is that the documents in question (threat messages, suicide notes, hate mail, etc.) are usually very brief and sometimes their writers make an effort to disguise any personal identity. Further, even if we can determine what “enough data” might mean, we need to have adequate samples of documents for comparison. And not just any old comparison samples will do. For example, it can be fruitless to compare the register of a threat message with the register of a business letter. Most of us have a range of styles available to us, so it’s necessary to obtain comparison samples in the same or at least similar genres and registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that isn’t enough to discourage us from determining the writers’ identity (or even their nationality, ethnicity, region, social status, age, or education level), we also have to be concerned about individual language variation.  People tend to not stay put geographically or socially, making them subject to language influences from wherever they live or work and from the language used by the people or groups that they live among or admire. Sometimes they get these influences right. Sometimes they get them only partly right. Sometimes they get all or parts of them dead wrong. Sometimes they incorporate only parts of the new influences and hang on to their older patterns, creating a language olio than comes close to defying individual or group identification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we also need to worry about language variability itself. Sociolinguistic research has accomplished a lot, but we’re only beginning to scratch the surface of all the kinds, rates, and comparative ratios in English use, much less that of the many other languages of the world. If a person uses a form that seems to stand out, we have to be relatively certain whether this feature stands out in the same way when it’s used by others. That is, we need to know whether this feature is a diagnostically significant identity marker at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we have good a good research base telling us that the feature in question is potentially diagnostic, we need to have a large enough corpus of the target’s language from which we can determine that person’s variable use of that particular feature. Two or three paragraphs are usually not enough. For example, consider the practice of some American English speakers to use the double negative. Research tells us that very few use it all the time. Some use it 60% of the time; others 20%. Some use it in speaking but less so or not at all in writing. If our data sample has only one or two instances of the double negative, what can we say about its diagnosticity in a hate mail message?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comments cited in and after Mark’s post point to various individual words, expressions, intonation, and pronunciations as evidence of the caller’s true national or ethnic identity. They find a feature that they believe to be diagnostic, and then claim that it is clear proof of the speaker’s language or ethnic identity. Unfortunately, it’s just not that easy. I’m no more able than they are to evaluate the sociolinguistic accuracy or power of their claims, but I humbly suggest that satisfying the argument about the nationality or ethnicity of the speaker may require a great deal more evidence than that which is available in this phone message. These features, if accurate, may offer some clues, but they don’t appear to be conclusive. Clues offer places to begin the analysis. They are not the evidence itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation reminds me of the way some linguists carry out authorship identification in the US today. It has some usefulness as an investigative tool, but it can be very troublesome to present such evidence in court. An alert and informed cross-examiner could ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Are you comparing the unknown language evidence in this case with comparable known language evidence? (i.e., comparable samples and sample size)&lt;br&gt;
2. How can you prove that the features you use are diagnostic of the differences or similarities that you claim? (amount and quality of data compared with evidence based on research findings)&lt;br&gt;
3. What are the known rates of variation in the features you use? (what does research tell us about variation in this feature of the language)&lt;br&gt;
4. If you know this rate of variation, how do you know that the alleged user follows or doesn’t follow it? (sample size and quality)&lt;br&gt;
5. When you point to individual words or expressions as diagnostic, how do you know that other people also do or do not use them? (the old question about idiolect)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt there is more that I haven’t covered here. It’s probably not a bad thing that in circumstances like the Mumbai tragedy, people are eager to find clues about who was responsible. The problem is in finding the most effective way to get beyond the clue stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Shuy</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228672646468"><id gr:original-id="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=888">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/0a67d7e8c9c68204</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Linguistics in the comics"/><title type="html">Zippy shops for catch phrases</title><published>2008-12-07T17:37:10Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T17:37:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=888" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Always on the lookout for catch phrases to play with, Zippy looks into the world of electronics, with little success:&lt;/p&gt;

Originally published in 1971, it's an exploration of a rather tragic footnote in the history of evolutionary science. Back in the early years of the 20th Century (prior to the understanding of DNA, but after Mendelian genetics had become well known), there was still a &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/04/dennert_and_the_deathbed_of_da.php"&gt;remnant&lt;/a&gt; of the biological community who preferred the Lamarckian idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics over the Darwinian idea of natural selection of random mutations. One of the vanguard for the Lamarckian idea was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kammerer"&gt;Paul Kammerer&lt;/a&gt; whose specialty was the breeding of amphibians that apparently few others could match. He claimed that he could get his toads and salamanders to &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;id=RPeuL6SJLdsC&amp;amp;dq=paul+kammerer&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;ots=4h47fodS4m&amp;amp;sig=t6V0GbRxNuYVYq4orQa2O3I-IKk&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;resnum=9&amp;amp;ct=result"&gt;acquire characteristics&lt;/a&gt; that were useful in the new environments in which he raised his specimens. This was touted loudly (in the &lt;a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E14FD3F5D15738DDDAB0894DA415B838EF1D3&amp;amp;scp=3&amp;amp;sq=paul%20kammerer&amp;amp;st=cse"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; for instance) as proof of Lamarckian inheritance and Kammerer was hailed as a 'new Darwin'. It all ended very badly when one toad specimen was found to be faked (by who remains a mystery), and Kammerer killed himself shortly afterwards (though there may have been more involved than scientific disgrace). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of the experiments and controversy can be read online (with various slants) &lt;a href="http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Case_of_the_Midwife_Toad/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://home.nycap.rr.com/useless/kammerer/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and a more modern non-replication of one of his experiments is described &lt;a href="http://www.mbl.edu/publications/pub_archive/Ciona/Kammerer/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. However, the reason I bring this up here is much more related to how the scientific community and Koestler dealt with this scientific maverick and the analogies that has for the climate science and its contrarians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are (at least) four points where the analogies with climate science are strong: First, there were clear philosophical motives for supporting Lamarckism (as there are for denying human effects on climate change) (see below). These are strongly articulated in Koestler's book, and it is obvious that the author feels some sympathy with that argument. Second, there is idealization of the romantic notion of the scientist-as-hero, sacrificing their all (literally in Kammerer's case) for the pursuit of truth in the teeth of establishment opposition (cf &lt;a href="http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/20/6/8/1"&gt;Svensmark&lt;/a&gt;). Third, there is the outrage at the apparent dirty tricks, rumours and persecution. Finally, there is the longing for a redemption - a time when the paradigm shift will occur and the hero will be proven right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough time has passed and enough additional scientific evidence has been gathered however to show that Kammerer's ideas are never going to be accepted into the mainstream. Therefore, we can use this episode to highlight how people's misunderstanding of scientific process can lead them astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's start with the non-scientific reasons why Kammerer's ideas had resonance. Martin Gardner in &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TwP3SGAUsnkC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=Gardner.+Martin,+In+the+Name+of+Science&amp;amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;amp;cad=0"&gt;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&lt;/a&gt; (1952) puts it well (p143):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just as Lamarckianism combines easily with an idealism in which the entire creation is fulfilling God's vast plan by constant upward striving, so also does it combine easily with political doctrines that emphasize the building of a better world.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that without Lamarckianism, none of the striving and achievement of a parent impacts their progeny's genetic material. That was a depressing thought for many people (what is the point of striving at all?), and hence there was a clear non-scientific yearning for Lamarckian inheritance to be correct. I use the past tense in referring to these almost 100 year-old arguments, but Koestler's book and more &lt;a href="http://lamarcksevolution.com/address-to-melbourne-writers-festival/"&gt;recent attempts&lt;/a&gt; to rehabilitate these ideas tap into these same (misguided) romantic notions. (Odd aside, one of the most &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/counterpoint/stories/2008/2358588.htm"&gt;positive treatments&lt;/a&gt; of this "neo-Lamarckianism" is by Michael Duffy, a &lt;a href="http://larvatusprodeo.net/2008/05/22/the-great-denialist-denial-of-denialism-exhibit-a/"&gt;frequent climate contrarian&lt;/a&gt; Australian journalist). Note that I am distinguishing the classic 'inheritance of acquired characteristics' from the much more respectable study of &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/epigenetics.php"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist-as-hero meme is a very popular narrative device and is widespread in most discussions of progress in science. While it's clearly true that some breakthroughs have happened through the work of a single person (special relativity is the classic case) and someone has to be the first to make a key observation (e.g. Watson and Crick), the vast majority of scientific progress occurs as the accumulation of small pieces of new information and their synthesis into a whole. While a focus on a single person makes for a good story, it is very rarely the whole or even a big part of the real story. Thus while Koestler can't be uniquely faulted for thinking that Lamarckianism rose and fell with Kammerer, that perspective leads him to imbue certain events with much more significance than is really warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, one of the more subtle misconceptions in the book though is how Koestler thinks that scientific arguments get settled. He places enormous emphasis on a academic tour that Kammerer made to the UK which included a well-documented talk in Cambridge in which the  subsequently-notorious specimen was also in attendance. In fact, Koestler devotes a large number of pages to first-hand recollections of the talk. Koestler also criticises heavily the arch-protagonist in this story (a Dr. Bateson) who did not attend Kammerer's talk, even though he presumably could have, while continuing to criticise his conclusions.  The talk is in fact held up to be the one missed opportunity for some academic mano-a-mano that Koestler presumably thinks would have settled things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that this is not how controversial ideas get either accepted or rejected. Sure, publishing papers, giving talks and attending conferences are all useful in bringing ideas to a wider audience, but they are very rarely the occasion of some dramatic denouement and mass conversion of the skeptical. Instead, ideas get accepted because of the increasing weight of evidence that supports them - and that usually comes in dribs and drabs. A replication here, a theoretical insight there, a validated prediction etc. Only in hindsight does there appear to be a clean sequence of breakthroughs that can be seen to have led inexorably to the new conclusions. At the time, the landscape is far more ambiguous. Thus in focusing on one specific talk, and on its reception by one particularly outspoken opponent, Koestler misses the wider issue - which was that Kammerer's ideas just didn't have any independent support. The wider community thus saw his work (as far as I can tell) as a curiosity: possibly his findings were correct, but his interpretation was likely not, and maybe his findings weren't all that reproducible in any case? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This remains the issue, if Lamarckian evolution were possible, it should have been viewable in hundreds of other systems that were much easier to replicate than Kammerer's toads (nematodes perhaps?). Absent that replication, no amount of exciting talks will have persuaded scientists. In that, scientists are probably a little different from the public, or at least the public who went to Kammerer's more public lectures where he was very warmly received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these circumstances, it is not surprising that Kammerer's more vocal opponents would occasionally give vent to their true feelings. Koestler is particular critical of Bateson who, in retrospect, does appear to have gone a little far in his public critiques of Kammerer.  However, Koestler perhaps doesn't realise how common quite scathing criticism is in the halls of academe. This rarely gets written down explicitly, but it is nonetheless there, and forms a big part of how well some people's ideas are received. If someone is perceived as an exaggerator, or an over-interpreter of their results, even their most careful work will not get a lot of support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koestler ends his book with the familiar refrain that since modern science is incomplete, alternative theories must continue to be pursued. He states that since "contemporary genetics has no answers to offer to the problem of the genesis of behaviour",  the replication the key experiments (which he clearly expected to vindicate Kammerer), would very likely make biologists 'sit up' and have a long-lasting impact on the field. This notion fails to take into account the vast amount of knowledge that already exists and that makes certain kinds of 'alternative' theories very unlikely to be true. The link between this optimistic expectation and discussions of climate change is persuasively demonstrated in this &lt;a href="http://n3xus6.blogspot.com/2007/04/some-mad-revel.html"&gt;pastiche&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one additional characteristic of this story that has some modern resonance, and that's the idea that once someone starts accepting one class of illogical arguments, that leads them to accept others that aren't really connected, but share some of the same characteristics. Some people have called this '&lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/06/crank_magnetism_in_action.php"&gt;crank magnetism&lt;/a&gt;'. In Kammerer's case, he was a great believer in the meaningfulness of coincidences and wrote &lt;a href="http://www.life-cycles-destiny.com/for/the-law-of-seriality-kammerer.htm"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt; trying to elucidate the 'laws' that might govern them. Koestler himself became a big &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Koestler#Paranormal_and_scientific_interests"&gt;proponent&lt;/a&gt; of parapsychology. And today there are examples of climate contrarians who are creationists or anti-vaccine campaigners. Though possibly this is just coincidence (or is it….?).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the true worth of any scientific idea is whether it leads to more successful predictions than other theories. So I'll finish with a 1923 prediction that Kammerer made while he was on a speaking tour of the US: "Take a very pertinent case. The next generation of Americans will be born without any desire for liquor if the prohibition law is continued and strictly enforced" (NYT, Nov 28).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>gavin</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/feed/</id><title type="html">RealClimate</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.realclimate.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228670436179"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/if_you_want_to_know_why_our_pu.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/fdf1d1fcbd3ac222</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Creationism"/><title type="html">If you want to know why our public schools are screwed up, here's one reason</title><published>2008-12-07T16:21:53Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T16:21:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/477621216/if_you_want_to_know_why_our_pu.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/if_you_want_to_know_why_our_pu.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cynthia Dunbar has &lt;a href="http://www.star-telegram.com/state_news/story/1077917.html"&gt;written a book&lt;/a&gt;. It's typical wingnut nonsense: it "refers to public education as &lt;span&gt;'a subtly deceptive tool of perversion'&lt;/span&gt; and calls the establishment of public schools unconstitutional and &lt;span&gt;'tyrannical.'&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; It goes further and says that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;…she believes public schools are unconstitutional because they undermine the scriptural authority of families to direct their children&amp;#39;s education. Her own children have been privately educated and home-schooled.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical and unsurprising so far. It&amp;#39;s a shame that she&amp;#39;s abusing the intellectual development of her own children, but unfortunately, she has that right. At least she&amp;#39;s not harming other kids…uh, wait a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cynthia Dunbar is on the Texas State Board of Education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunbar has served as the state board's District 10 representative since 2006. Her district covers 16 counties in Southeast Texas, including half of Travis County. She is a member of the board's instruction committee, which oversees curriculum and graduation requirements, student assessment programs, library standards, and the selection of textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America&amp;#39;s method of governing public education is severely broken when a kook and hater of public schools like this can be one of the top administrators of educational policy in one of the largest public school systems we have. And that she is evaluating textbooks and curriculum…I am appalled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.tfn.org/"&gt;Texas Freedom Network&lt;/a&gt; is on the case. I think we need something deeper than just booting this destructive lunatic off the board of education, though — we need sweeping structural change all across the country so that the only people put in charge of schools are those who have an interest in making them &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;. Do you think a corporation, for instance, would succeed if it promoted people to positions of power who openly admitted that all they wanted to do was destroy the company from within?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/if_you_want_to_know_why_our_pu.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/477621216" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228669780136"><id gr:original-id="tag:typepad.com,2003:post-59620386">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/a257d43a455fcd00</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Other Blog Carnivals" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category"/><title type="html">Carnival of the Godless #106</title><published>2008-12-07T16:31:21Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T16:32:30Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/12/carnival-of-the-godless-106.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2008/12/carnival-of-the-godless-106.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" xml:lang="en-US" type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Holiday Feast Edition of the Carnival of the Godless has just been posted at &lt;a href="http://thechapel.wordpress.com/2008/12/06/carnival-of-the-godless-106-holiday-feast-edition/"&gt;An Apostate’s Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.  Plenty of food for thought there, as the host says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a side note, I’ll be hosting in two weeks time on December 21.  Please send me your posts for inclusion by end of day, Friday December 19.  Also, Brent is looking for hosts.  With &lt;a href="http://outcampaign.org/blogroll"&gt;over 1,000 atheist blogs&lt;/a&gt;, there most be a few who would like to host a COTG.  It’s great publicity for your blog.  See the &lt;a href="http://carnivalofthegodless.blogspot.com/"&gt;COTG scheduling page&lt;/a&gt; for Brent’s contact details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Skeptico</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Skeptico</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228669518128"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-21219785.post-3801941124006250895">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6ef198c6f75942d1</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">Presuppositions, Assumptions, Worldviews and Control Beliefs.</title><published>2008-12-07T15:06:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T16:59:26Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DebunkingChristianity/~3/477574759/presuppositions-assumptions-worldviews.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/feeds/3801941124006250895/comments/default" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=21219785&amp;postID=3801941124006250895" title="12 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/presuppositions-assumptions-worldviews.html"/><content xml:base="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/" type="html">In my book I explicitly state that some skeptics may not like the way I argue. One of the reasons is because I talk about presuppositions, assumptions, worldviews, and control beliefs. In one of my posts a discussion flared up about this starting with author &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/12/what-evidence-is-there-against.html?showComment=1228583160000#c4373077402700866041"&gt;Jeffrey Mark’s comment&lt;/a&gt;. While he wasn’t responding directly to anything I had written let me respond.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think scientifically minded and theologically or philosophical minded people go head to head over these ideas. As a philosophical minded person let me try to explain this to scientifically minded people, if I can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The definitions of these words are similar but not exactly the same. They apply differently depending on the particular subject at hand. And they involve different things depending on whether the context is a discussion with someone else, or simply describing what we believe to be the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let’s say we are discussing or debating an idea with someone else. When we engage in any argument we all have our presuppositions and assumptions. Those beliefs are the ones we presuppose and are assumed to be true. These beliefs are not presently on the table at the moment. They are presupposed for the sake of further conversation. If two Christians are debating over Arminianism and Calvinism they do not need to begin by arguing whether or not God exists or whether the Bible is God’s word. They are presupposing them in this context. If two philosophers are arguing about the existence of God they must presuppose that they are communicating with each other in a real material world, and that the discussion is an important one. If two scientists are arguing about something the same thing applies with regard to the importance of science, the reliability of induction and their senses.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any presupposition or assumption can be laid on the table though, and discussed. A Christian Arminian would be frustrated in discussing Christian theology with someone who didn’t accept the Bible as the word of an existing God. A philosopher may be frustrated in having to continually revisit whether there is a material world before he can argue other things with other philosophers about other topics. A scientist would abhor having to go back and revisit the reliability of his senses with a pantheist who might require it, since the pantheist believes everything is &lt;em&gt;maya&lt;/em&gt;, or an illusion. So some discussions between people who see things differently might be extremely frustrating, for they don’t agree on some basic common beliefs. That’s why Christian philosopher James Sire’s book is called, &lt;em&gt;The Universe Next Door&lt;/em&gt;. Some of us see things so differently we live in different intellectual universes. There is even debate among theologians, philosophers and philosophers of science whether or not there is common ground between people who live in these different intellectual universes. Philosophers of science debate whether differing scientific paradigms are commensurable or incommensurable (ala Thomas Kuhn). Applied scientists are usually not informed about this kind of debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to what we believe, our problem is to try and isolate one of our particular assumptions for analysis. It’s extremely difficult if not impossible to do. For all assumptions and presuppositions we hold to are placed within the context of a whole worldview. We try to make consistent sense of our beliefs about God, the universe, ethics, politics, history, death, and so forth. A worldview is our particular way of making all of our beliefs cohere into a single consistent system of thought. Since it's impossible to lay our whole worldview on the table for analysis we can only isolate and analyze one or two particular beliefs at a time within it. But when we do so the other beliefs that form our worldview play a part in our analysis of that one particular belief we are trying to isolate for analysis. These other beliefs are called background beliefs. Our background beliefs consist of everything we have ever experienced and everything we have ever come to believe (minus that one particular belief we are trying to analyze). These background beliefs of ours control how we evaluate that particular belief in question, so I call them control beliefs. They control how we view that one particular belief in question. These control beliefs can actually explain away the evidence if they are strongly held ones. This is little different than the differing stories that a prosecutor and defense attorney might tell based upon the available evidence, one showing the defendant guilty and the other one showing that he is innocent. The evidence is the same. How do you decide?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An additional and telling problem is that no one has probably analyzed all of his beliefs. There are beliefs we have assumed are true based upon early childhood experiences that we have never placed on the table. Analyzing all of our beliefs is probably impossible otherwise we’d have to revisit every book we’ve ever read, every conversation, and every experience. So we all have unexamined beliefs we assume to be true, all of us. Some beliefs are more important and controlling than others, some have less evidence for them than others, and some are so well founded in our minds that we cannot question them, but we all have them. And they control how we see things, everything, for they are all placed within our own particular worldview. Furthermore, every belief we have is disputed by someone else in the world who can offer his reasons for doing so, even if we may disagree. Throughout history you will find this the case as well. No matter what you believe there has been a scholar, a philosopher, or a scientist who believed differently. That’s why philosopher/scientist A. N. Whitehead wrote, “Some assumptions appear so obvious that people do not know that they are assuming because no other way of putting things has ever occurred to them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven’t covered everything on this topic but for the record I do think we should follow the evidence and I do trust the reliability of our senses and the scientific method as the only possible way out of this quagmire of beliefs. And I think it is intellectual dishonesty to assume with any kind of certainty a whole worldview like the presuppositionalists do. To do that is to be impervious to all outside criticism. It is to lock oneself inside an ivory tower in the sky that never has to touch down on earth. I do not assume my whole worldview web of beliefs are all true with any degree of certainty. Some beliefs form the center of my web, like logic and my senses, while those in middle and on the periphery become less and less firmly held ones. And I must continually isolate one belief after another for analysis, even I cannot give up those that are closer and closer to the center of my web because I have solid reasons for trusting in them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case I acknowledge the problem. So when it comes to my critique of the Christian theistic worldview I spend over half of my book arguing for my particular set of skeptical control beliefs. I do not assume them when crossing over into a different intellectual universe such as Christianity. As an outsider I shouldn’t do this if I want to be heard. I must first argue for them. To anyone who attempts to critique a different worldview he must argue for why he sees things differently. In the case of Christianity he must argue why he trusts science, rather than assuming it, and he must argue for why he adopts a skeptical set of control beliefs, rather than merely assuming a skeptical position. He must truly engage their worldview by understanding it. And he must start by critiquing their supernatural assumptions and their belief in the Bible as God's word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I remain ambivalent about the whole bailout thing, mainly because I hate rewarding incompetence. On the other hand, the economic devastation that would result gives me pause, the reassurances of some commenters that it wouldn't be such a huge deal having utterly failed to convince me. However, there is one thing that irritates the hell out of me, regardless of the relative merits of this bailout versus the financial bailout, and that's the grandstanding and amazing hypocrisy of some truly annoying politicians--especially from states with foreign auto plants who would stand to gain if the Big Three fail and from New York state, one of whom (&lt;a href="http://maloney.house.gov/"&gt;Carolyn Maloney&lt;/a&gt;) asked &lt;a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008812060362"&gt;why her constituents should bail out the Big Three&lt;/a&gt; when automakers fought state laws designed to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Well, I would ask why taxpayers from my state should give bankers and speculators on Wall Street 20 times as much money when they fight both at the national and state levels any laws to regulate them more closely, laws that might have forestalled the economic meltdown that is due in a large part to their own greed and incompetence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying that just because we bailed out Wall Street we should bail out Detroit. Rather, I'm saying that Wall Street is just as guilty of opposing laws and regulations that would have restrained them and potentially benefited society, both at the federal and state level, and they got a handout more than 40 times as much without nearly so much pontificating and tongue lashing of their executives. Heck, the first version of the Wall Street bailout was only one page long and gave the Secretary of the Treasury essentially &lt;em&gt;carte blanche&lt;/em&gt; to distribute the $700 billion however he saw fit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hypocrisy of Congresscritters never ceases to amaze me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/12/jon_stewart_on_the_detroit_bailout.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/insolence/~4/477539334" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Respectful Insolence</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228660532116"><id gr:original-id="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4576">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/8e2ff2e5e3a20981</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Meta Stuff"/><category term="bill hackett"/><category term="northwest edit"/><category term="sexism"/><category term="william hackett"/><title type="html">A Peek Into the (Hate-)Mailbag</title><published>2008-12-07T13:52:09Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T13:52:09Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4576" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://skepchick.org/" type="html">&lt;img style="float:left;margin-right:10px;border:none" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar.php?gravatar_id=19f731548bcbcb321437c6b20d98bd03&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here at Skepchick get a ton of email, which we totally love: links to news, questions, suggestions, all that good stuff. Every now and again, we also get a bit of hate mail. Normally it goes right in the garbage, but this one was just way too good: Bill Hackett of Everett, Washington, sent us a note to let us know exactly how he feels about the female population as a whole:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why, knowing that women are emotion-driven creatures and except for a rare few, incapable of sustained, objective, rational thought, should I take your columns seriously?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(He then went on to criticize the way we look.) The fact that a person holds onto such an outdated (by several decades at least) mode of thought is pretty bizarre, I know. After all, there’s actually no good research to show that men are any more inherently rational than women. In fact, I’d say that it’s a testament to our innate logic and critical thinking skills that women are so rational today, considering the fact that for a few thousand years men managed to deny women adequate education or any kind of power over their lives. So, we already know that Bill is pretty ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what upgrades this bit of hate mail to something truly amusing is that Bill sent us this missive using an email address that is tied directly to his “business,” &lt;a href="http://www.nwedit.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Northwest Edit&lt;/a&gt;. So, while ordinarily I’d ignore Bill’s letter, it occurred to me that there may be women who were considering using his video/DVD editing services without knowing that Bill doesn’t believe they have the ability to think rationally. Emotion-driven creatures like women will probably want to choose their video editor based on that info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final point I’d like to make is that Bill used his real, personal information to register his web site’s domain name. All told, within about 20 seconds of receiving his email, I had Bill’s full name, address, phone number, personal Yahoo email address, IP address, Internet service provider, and business information. It’s funny, isn’t it? A more emotion-driven creature might have done more with all that information, and a more rational person might not have volunteered all that information to the person he was insulting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rebecca</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228659676866"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/radio_reminder_38.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/d0793b143e27271b</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Godlessness"/><title type="html">Radio reminder</title><published>2008-12-07T14:06:10Z</published><updated>2008-12-07T14:06:10Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/477529024/radio_reminder_38.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/radio_reminder_38.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Austin Dacey is an interesting fellow who has written a book on the non-religious basis of morality, &lt;i&gt;The Secular Conscience: Why Belief Belongs in Public Life&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:9px"&gt;(&lt;a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591026040/pharyngula-20" title="buy this book at amazon"&gt;amzn&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/click?bfmid=2181&amp;amp;sourceid=41505966&amp;amp;bfpid=1591026040&amp;amp;bfmtype=book" title="buy this book at barnes&amp;amp;noble"&gt;b&amp;amp;n&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1772498-9836638?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abebooks.com%2Fservlet%2FSearchResults%3Fisbn=1591026040&amp;amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;amp;cm_cat=1616003&amp;amp;cm_pla=1772498&amp;amp;cm_ite=Abebooks-Book+Redirection+Allowed" title="buy this book at abebooks"&gt;abe&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/partner?partner_id=30010&amp;amp;cgi=product&amp;amp;isbn=1591026040" title="buy this book at Powells"&gt;pwll&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and he is going to be on &lt;a href="http://mnatheists.org/content/view/216/1/"&gt;Atheists Talk radio&lt;/a&gt; this morning at 9am Central time.

They claim that this move is strategic, and not a function of financial necessity.  O’Brien led the science, space, technology, and environment unit, which will now be folded into the general news coverage. CNN claims that their Planet in Peril section can cover environmental news (saying nothing about other science).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have discussed this trend previous - the erosion of science coverage by mainstream media. We have focussed on “dead-tree” outlets like the major newspapers and news magazines, who have had declining readership and as sales and have therefore had to reduce overhead. There has therefore been a trend of cutting specialty reporters and editors and folding them into general news coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is not true for cable networks, however. They are not under the same financial pressures as newspapers. CNN itself claims this is not financial - which means they are not doing this out of necessity, they actually think it’s a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, such moves have proven disastrous for science coverage. The mainstream media in general does a mediocre job of covering science news, but there are some dedicated science news reporters who do a good job. Science coverage requires scientific literacy and a basic understanding of the institutions of science. Science editors need to be able to tell a legitimate science news story from a bogus one, or (increasingly common) a company or con-artist using a science news press release to gain free publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fringe science requires even more expertise and judgment, and even otherwise good science news reporters often fall down when they think a science news story is not “serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been perusing the science news coverage on the major network websites for several years, and in my opinion CNN’s science coverage has been spotty. It has generally been better than MSNBC but not as good as the BBC (in my casual observation). I fully expect the quality to tank and for many more bogus science news stories to slip past the general editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings up the larger issue of the structure of online news coverage in general. It is clearly in rapid transition, and no one knows yet where it will end up. Science blogs are taking an increasing role in reporting news, and some dedicated science outlets (like Scientific American) are taking the lead in online science news reporting. Some science news outlets, like Discover, are partnering with independent science bloggers (they have signed Phil Plait, for example, with Bad Astronomy). Perhaps this will be the trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems, therefore, that the science news will be covered online by someone, and perhaps that is enough. However, I am still concerned about the mainstream news outlets doing a bad job of covering science news, or covering bogus fringe stories as if they were science news. Perhaps they should just farm-out their science news coverage to a dedicated science outlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may also see the development of more online news feeds, like AP and Reuters. Perhaps we need a dedicated AP-like science news feed for the general media. Perhaps something like this already exists and I am just not aware of it (if there is, let me know), but I have not encountered any high-profile such service. There are science press-release aggregators, but that’s different. I am talking about experienced science journalists feeding science news to news outlets. Perhaps this is a niche that needs to be filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while CNN’s move is a disturbing trend, perhaps we will emerge on the other side of this news transition to something better. We’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Steven Novella</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">The Rogues Gallery</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.theskepticsguide.org/sgublog" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228640271814"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33112888.post-5242297321196900121">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/c6b3eff864257a03</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><title type="html">I've just had my Viva.

I've not been posting lately because I've been preparing for the Viva for my PhD. This is where scarily bright people quiz you about your Thesis and all the work you've been doing over the last 3+ years.  If you pass it then you've basically passed your PhD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I passed! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've got some 'minor corrections', which is normal, and they don't seem too bad. Mainly typos (which readers of this blog will understand), and a couple of extra columns in a table, and an extra figure. In fact they are actually quite interesting additions, so barring any major cock ups, I'll be graduating next year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I know there has been some rumours about who the next Doctor is and all the smart money is on the excellent Patterson Joseph, but It's not for me to put myself forward.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor P.T. Myers&lt;br&gt;
Dr. PZ Myers&lt;br&gt;
Division of Science and Mathematics&lt;br&gt;
600 E 4th Avenue&lt;br&gt;
University of Minnesota, Morris&lt;br&gt;
Morris, MN 56267&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Myers,&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you concerning the email campaign you instigated against the Creation Museum and the Cincinnati Zoo and your personal vendetta against Mr. Hamm.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what your ultimate agenda is in propagating a writing campaign to a Zoo in a state you don't live in and your taxes don't support, but your ignorance is apparent.  How someone so intolerant and closed minded could possibly be considered educated is beyond my comprehension. What scares me more is that people like you are teaching our children.  You don't teach science.  You indoctrinate with propaganda.  Darwin has about as much evidence proving natural selection as you have in proving there is no God.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;You are quite free to believe what you want to believe, but unless Hitler was your mentor, you should know that you have NO RIGHT to interfere with other organizations or businesses that want to colaborate just because you disagree with their arguement.  This only proves your hatred of people of faith.  What are you afraid of?&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;It is teachers like you that have exploded the growth of home schooling.  It is professors like you that have encouraged the installation and growth of faith based and Christian Colleges.  So for that, I guess I have people like you to thank.  Thank God my children will have somewhere else to go. I don't want them learning the fairy tale of evolution, I want them to be free to investigate ALL available arguments.  All of them.  I mean, the theory of evolution is all you have?  Seriously?  Science isn't in the box, professor.  You can't prove evolution and you can't prove creation.  No one can.  So why can't we talk about both?  We rehash the same dead, unproven, broken theory when there are so many other questions out there to be asked, researched and experimented with?  That sir, is intolerance.  That is bigotry.  That is ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I don't think the Cincinatti Zoo will be thanking you.  As a result of your hatred and intolerance toward anyone that says "bless you", The Cincinatti Zoo has lost a very valuable partner,and a lot of visitors to their website.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I would like to point out to you, Mr. Myers, that you are not the only one who runs a blog,and you are not the only one who can write.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I may not be a professor, but I know how to write a press release and I know how to advertise.   That's my business.  So here's what I will do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how your school handles an email blitz from Christians (which I will point out to you sir, comprises of approximately 97% of the population of the United States).  I am suddenly motivated to hit every one of my news sources and let them know how marxist you are.  I want every parent in this country to know exactly what dangers their kids face, risking having you as a professor in that school.  I want them all to know that it's not good enough to indoctrinate just the students in your lecture hall.  You want to make sure NO ONE gets exposure to any possible answers.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I want all those Christian families to think twice before ever considering sending their kids to University of Minnesota . . . and don't worry.  I'll make sure you get plenty of credit for their decision.  Email campaigns can work both ways professor.  Oh, I know your school is not the only culprit and you're not the only marxist professor teaching in our colleges.  However, we can start with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Evolution is a failed hypothesis.  It cannot even be scientifically tested.  You know it, and most of your radical scientists know it.  And this kind of attack from you is just evident of the death throes of the false theory of evolution.  Much like the snake trying to get one last bite as you cut off it's head, it knows it's dying . . . it knows it's not going to win, but it's going to try like hell to do as much damage as it can before it dies.  Real scientific, doc.  Darwin is your god.  We have proof that he is dead.  Mine is not.  You have no proof that he doesn't exist.  You won't let anyone try to prove it, which I guess answers what you are afraid of.  Let the kids discuss it professor.  What are you afraid ot?  Research is the mother of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Ninety-seven percent are Christian in this country, professor, think about that.  It's a well known statistic. . . I know state taxes don't pay ALL your school's bills.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;You can post this on your blog, you can laugh or throw it away, delete it . . . I don't care.  It is of no consequence to me.  I just wanted to let you know how I feel and what I'm about to embark on.  Because marxists are not the only ones afforded freedom of speech and freedom to inquire in this country.  If freedom to bully others is an ammedment I haven't heard of yet, then I guess we both share that right as well.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;I hope this doesn't offend you, but I end most of my letters this way . . . God Bless you.  You are the one who needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a href="http://mr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12291.html" rel="external "&gt;See this press release for a refresher&lt;/a&gt;.)  Of course, creationists jumped on this research and began harping that the more scientists looked, the more distant humans and chimps were.  This is important to them because the number one rule of creationism is “no matter what, humans are not related to any other living creatures,” which is so difficult to maintain in our age of science and education.—Amusingly, humans and chimps are so similar to one another that creationists cannot create a consistent definition of “created kinds” that makes humans special and lumps all the boring animals together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britten (2002) derived his 5% divergence metric by considering the lengths of insertions and deletions (indels) along with point substitutions between human and chimp genomes.  This is unlike other estimates that just consider the number of point substitutions that have occurred between the two species and find ~1.2% divergence.  At the time I commented that these two numbers—1.2% and 5%—could not be compared because they are different metrics.  Additionally, Britten’s metric is probably unfairly upweighting the contribution of indels because a single event can add or remove multiple residues at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/msn275v1?ijkey=BJIyrYQAKWJSZzY&amp;amp;keytype=ref" rel="external "&gt;A recent study of mine&lt;/a&gt;, which was not directed at Bitten’s work, has found that it is actually worse than that.  Simply put, the total length of indels separating humans and chimps is unrelated to the evolutionary divergence between them.  This arises because the variance of indel length is “nearly-infinite”, which causes nonconservation of average indel length.  Therefore, two pairs of species, equally divergent evolutionarily, can and probably will have very different proportions of nucleotides belonging to indels.  One pair might be 5% divergent and the other 1.5% divergent, including indels, without any underlying change in the evolutionary process or time since speciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside is that traditional substitution based evolutionary distances are unaffected and can still be used to properly estimate the evolutionary divergence between species.&lt;/p&gt;

If you read his article, you'll discover a theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The live Nativity at the Creation Museum will have an actual, living, cud-chewing camel. Frightening.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There will also be goats and sheep. Terrifying.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Cuddly lambs might seem harmless to the average visitor, but some people are scared witless by the possibility that some innocent, devout secularist could accidentally wander onto the grounds of the Creation Museum and get exposed to radioactive Christianity or other dangerous ideas that should be outlawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer, Peter Bronson, hammers on this idea over and over — that scientists are afraid of creationists. By imputing a false motive to our actions, he goes farther and farther astray into never-never land, building up this astonishingly elaborate house of cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He does get one part halfway correct, though. He quotes another article on the Enquirer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Asking me to &amp;#39;tolerate&amp;#39; this kind of worldview is akin to asking me to &amp;#39;tolerate&amp;#39; illiteracy. Both are problems of education and intelligence. Creationist thought is ... naïve, it is anti-intellectual, and it harkens back to pre-enlightenment thinking. I don&amp;#39;t have any tolerance for that.&amp;quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Got that? Creationists are stupid, illiterate, naïve and backward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naïve and backward is quite correct; they are promoting bad old ideas that have long been disproven. I do not think creationists are stupid — creationism is a deficit that you can overcome — and most are literate to some degree. If only Mr Bronson actually understood what he wrote, because it explains so much more than his &amp;quot;fear&amp;quot; thesis. We react as we do to the proposals of creationists because they are &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;. We aren't afraid of such absurdities at all, it's more of an intellectual commitment to addressing falsehoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, though, the creationists have caught me brandishing my cyber pistol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a little sad that the zoo would cave in to a cyber war," Ham said. He believes most of the protests came from people who don't live anywhere near Cincinnati - instigated by P.Z. Myers of Minnesota, a "godless liberal" blogger-atheist who has made a hobby of spiteful attacks on Christians, Christmas and the Creation Museum.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"They're the ones who are being intolerant," Ham said. "We're not afraid of creationists going to the Zoo and seeing their messages about evolution. People have to stand on their own beliefs. It's not up to us to say you can't go to this place or that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a fine, entertaining hobby it is, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they make it so easy when they mischaracterize everything so grossly. Did anyone say people can't go to the Creation Museum? Did anyone block the ability of the Creation Museum to sell tickets? Is anyone afraid of the Big Dumb Ham? Why, no. All that happened is that they were told they can't borrow the good name of a legitimate educational and scientific institution when they are shilling for their museum. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes me wonder: If the science is so unshakeable, what are they afraid of? Why wouldn't they welcome a debate? Why not encourage open-minded exploration? Isn't that what scientific inquiry is all about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, abandon that premise. We are not afraid. The real issue is that this is a &lt;i&gt;settled&lt;/i&gt; scientific question, long resolved and with growing evidential support, and there is little point in continuing the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has had kids knows this situation: when they discover the word &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;, they learn that it is a tool for starting an unending conversation. Give &amp;#39;em an answer, and they just say &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; again; explain that, and it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; again; the game keeps going until the adult gives up in exasperation. We all know that the kid is not trying to think or get a complete answer — he just wants attention. We can answer for a while with patience, but at some point we have to stop and insist that the child exhibit a little more honest curiousity to trigger more answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creationists passed the point of honest inquiry long ago. I would suggest to Mr Bronson that he go through his little essay and try replacing every instance of the word "afraid" with "exasperated" and he might see his way through to a little more truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe not. The rest of his essay reveals that honesty is not a word he's interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious adult answer to the protesters is simple: If you don't like it, don't go. Buy your ticket to the zoo and enjoy the Festival of Lights. Your experience will not be contaminated by the opportunity to see the Creation Museum's live Nativity. There is no proven scientific risk of catching contagious Christianity from merely touching a ticket.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But it seems like the only thing Americans have really perfected in the past 30 years is the art of being mortally offended by ridiculous trivialities. So here we go again. Some insecure secularists get scared by ideas they fear, and off we go - another brick wall of political correctness must be built to shield feeble minds from taboo thoughts and theories.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I suppose next they will try to ban Santa Claus because all that stuff about reindeer pulling his sleigh pulled across the sky has not been peer-reviewed in a scientific journal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Christ would probably be outlawed too by the Secular Police, but his name's on the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeat: nobody said you can&amp;#39;t go to the Creation Museum. Nobody is worried that you&amp;#39;ll catch Christianity from a poorly done pseudo-museum. Nobody is threatening to ban Santa Claus or Christianity, either. But these baseless accusations are just so useful to inflame the martyr gland of the poor Christian majority. I have to feel sorry for them — their sense of self-worth seems to reside in a belief that they are persecuted for their beliefs, and it&amp;#39;s just so hard to maintain when you&amp;#39;re a dominant majority trying to force-feed religious absurdities on people with educations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/fed_up_not_afraid.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/476953941" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228598541379"><id gr:original-id="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/06/two-updates/">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/57751983cfc1675e</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Astronomy"/><category term="Cool stuff"/><title type="html">Two updates</title><published>2008-12-06T21:09:08Z</published><updated>2008-12-06T21:09:08Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/12/06/two-updates/" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy" type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two quick updates:&lt;/p&gt;

That's useful, but I don't think he looked deeply enough, and his suggestions don't really help much. In particular, he compares the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution to Newton's "law of gravity" and tries to extract a message about why one is unquestioned and the other is not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. If the story of your marketing requires the prospect to abandon a previously believed story, you have a lot of work to do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nobody had a seriously described theory of gravity before Newton named it. No one walks around saying that they have a story about why we stick to the earth better than the gravity story. As a result, there was no existing story or worldview to overthrow. Naming something that people already believe in is very smart marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, there was an existing theory of gravity — several, in fact. The best known was Aristotle&amp;#39;s, who posited that there was a natural place where every object ideally wished to be located. For most solid objects, that ideal place was the center of the earth, and for less substantial objects, like steam and smoke, it was in the heavens, so everything was drawn naturally to it&amp;#39;s optimum destination unless hindered. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newton&amp;#39;s laws were accepted by the common people without question because they didn&amp;#39;t know what they were. Ask anyone now, outside of a university at least, and you won&amp;#39;t get many who say &amp;#39;G•m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;•m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;', or even understand that he quantitatively described the force of attraction between any two masses. It's enough that he didn't say something crazy, like that apples fall up, therefore it was OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godin is right here. Everyone simply takes the force of gravity for granted, so hearing that some smart guy figured out how to calculate the exact magnitude of that force is unchallenging. Evolution is different. There are &lt;i&gt;lots&lt;/i&gt; of creation myths around, all of them created out of a complete absence of evidence and describing past phenomenon of which the storytellers had no understanding, and evolution is directly challenging all of them with facts and evidence. So, sure, it makes for a harder sell. It's not particularly helpful to be told that your product is hard to market, though: it's the product we've got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. If the timeframe of the message of your marketing is longer than the attention span (or lifetime) of the person you are marketing to, you have your work cut out for you as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Evolution is really slow. Hard to demonstrate it in real time during a school board meeting. Gravity is instantaneous. Baseball players use it every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseball players do not, however, use Newton&amp;#39;s laws. People can hit a ball with a stick without using a single equation, and had been doing so long before Newton started scribbling. Try going into a schoolboard meeting and convincing them that students need to learn G•m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;•m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, rather than that they have to fund supplies for athletics. Then you'll discover how well established gravity is as an educational essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have some immediately persuasive props for evolution, too: fossils. Plop a dinosaur bone down in front of students, and it is immediately effective, and far more impressive than bouncing a ball. What you find, though, is immediacy is not enough. Creationists go to great lengths to contrive elaborate rationalizations to dismiss direct demonstrations. There's something more going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Godin's explanations miss the key points of contention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number one is &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; evolution. All those surveys of people's attitudes towards evolution experience major shifts if the questions are simply reworded: ask whether they believe humans evolved from apes, and half of Americans will say no. Ask them if animals evolved from simpler forms, and the yes answers surge upwards by tens of percentage points. It is not an objection to evolution in principle, but to evolution as an explanation of &lt;i&gt;their personal history&lt;/i&gt;. I'm sure there's a marketing principle to be stated there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second objection is to chance and the lack of purpose. People really, desperately &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; there to be a personal agency to causality — they become utterly irrational about it all if you try to imply that no, fate, destiny, and ultimate cosmic purpose guided them to their mate, for instance. It couldn&amp;#39;t have been just &lt;i&gt;chance&lt;/i&gt;. I suspect this is a consequence of the first contention: people want to believe that they are important agents in the universe, and one of the implications of evolution is that they aren't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a marketing guy wants to help out with the evolution debates, those are ideas I'd like to know how to sell better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/marketing_evolution.php#commentsArea"&gt;Read the comments on this post...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~4/476800356" height="1" width="1"&gt;</summary><author gr:unknown-author="true"><name>(author unknown)</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/atom.xml</id><title type="html">Pharyngula</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228581307941"><id gr:original-id="tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3286249888310401017.post-2036332037208760595">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6c1b7bb830101395</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Evolution" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Journals" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><category term="Education" scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#"/><title type="html">All about eye evolution.</title><published>2008-12-06T13:03:00Z</published><updated>2008-12-10T02:28:18Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Genomicron/~3/KWvT0_vT0ZI/all-about-eye-evolution.html" type="text/html"/><link rel="replies" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=3286249888310401017&amp;postID=2036332037208760595" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://genomicron.blogspot.com/2008/12/all-about-eye-evolution.html"/><content xml:base="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/" type="html">&lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/120878/cover-medium.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:95px;height:128px" src="http://www.springerlink.com/content/120878/cover-medium.jpg" alt="" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The most recent issue of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic"&gt;Evolution: Education and Outreach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is now available &lt;a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/m3k441k67q3n/"&gt;free online&lt;/a&gt;.

Do we have one? Does anyone? Care to discuss this?&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a former minister I know that Christians have several long term strategies with strong organizations. Maybe we can learn from them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their first strategy is to reach children. They target children in the home and the church. The younger the better. There is a group called &lt;a href="http://www.cefonline.com/"&gt;Childhood Evangelism&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to convert kids as young as they can. Richard Dawkins calls things like this "child abuse." There are bus ministries geared toward getting kids to church. Norman L. Geisler, who is considered the "dean of apologetics," was raised in an atheist home but was converted as the result of a bus ministry that brought him to church every Sunday for ten years!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there are college campus ministries like Bill Bright's &lt;a href="http://www.campuscrusadeforchrist.com/"&gt;Campus Crusade for Christ&lt;/a&gt;. William Lane Craig is involved with this group. There are even rich Christian benefactors who have bought up hundreds of thousands of copies of Josh McDowell's books which are distributed for free on college campuses! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then on the cultural level there is the important &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2008/05/samaritan-strategy-for-skeptics.html"&gt;Samaritan Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, where by doing good works in the name of Jesus they influence our society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christians have legal groups to protect their rights as well, like &lt;a href="http://www.clsnet.org/"&gt;The Christian Legal Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other things Christians do to reach people and inflence society. Are we as skeptics interested in doing likewise? I know we don't have the numbers or means to do as much as Christians do, but are we serious about changing society and influencing minds, or not? I think most people who become skeptics simply get on with life, since after all, this is the only life they will ever have. Only a small minority of them become passionate to change minds and change society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an agnostic, Robert G. Ingersol was probably the most powerful orator in the 19th century, speaking to standing room only crowds. He was rich and he was powerful. He could speak out as he desired, and he did. There are many books available that contain his speeches. As such, he could've financed a national atheist/agnostic organization to influence American society. Our movement could've been started much earlier if he had. But he didn't. Now we have several of these organizations. Are YOU involved in any of them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there more we can do? Is there more YOU as a skeptic can do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest problem might just be fear, and some of this is justified. There is the fear of coming out of the so-called closet. If you have not yet done so, at least seriously consider doing this. There is power in numbers. You realize, don't you, that in numbers we may be the second largest denomination in America behind Catholics! &lt;a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com/2007/06/timesharris-poll-14-of-us-could-be.html"&gt;One in four&lt;/a&gt; Americans may be either agnostic or atheist. The more of us who tell the people we know what we think, the better. Just think of it this way. There have been a great many people who went before us and suffered a great deal so that we have the freedom to speak out, some of whom were burned at the stake. Don't trample on their blood. If they did this for us then we should do it for those who come after us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any other thoughts?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Yesterday, I saw some discussion of pronunciation and word choice in what is said to be a recorded telephone conversation between one of the terrorists and TV journalists. Thus Yogi Sikand, "&lt;a href="http://www.rediff.com///news/2008/dec/04mumterror-lies-of-the-lashkar.htm"&gt;Lies of the Lashkar&lt;/a&gt;", Rediff, 12/4/2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Not possessing a television set myself, it was only just now that was I able to listen to the recording, hosted on the Internet, of a conversation which took place some days ago between a terrorist holed up at Nariman House in Mumbai and calling himself 'Imran Babar' and reporters of the India TV channel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;It is plainly evident from the conversation that the terrorist was a Pakistani, most likely a Punjabi. This is obvious from his accent and the sort of Urdu he speaks. One can easily make out that he had been carefully tutored by his mentors who masterminded the deadly terror assault on Mumbai to intersperse his hate-driven harangue with some Hindi words (shanti, parivar etc) and to use Urdu words in the typical Hindi way (jabardasti instead of zabardasti etc.) so as to give the misleading impression that he and the other terrorists with him were Indian Muslims, not Pakistanis. The terrorists claimed to belong to the 'Deccan' in India, but it is obvious that this was not at all the case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the recording in question is &lt;a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=QhO6rynb1C8"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://reader.googleusercontent.com/reader/embediframe?src=http://www.youtube.com/v/QhO6rynb1C8%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=344" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some dissenting linguistic analysis in the &lt;a href="http://uk.youtube.com/comment_servlet?all_comments&amp;amp;v=QhO6rynb1C8&amp;amp;fromurl=/watch%3Fv%3DQhO6rynb1C8"&gt;YouTube comments&lt;/a&gt;, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;seems like you know pakistanis more than we know huh? u gota b kidding dude we dont use these words&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Itihaas&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Prasashann&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Sarkaar&amp;quot;??? we dont know what they meant for sarkar we say hakomat or government but other two are too creepy to b understandable and I wont even bother. ALl I want to say. this BHAIYAA accent is not paki. we dont say JOROR we say ZURURRRRRR .. our Z remains Z from sindh to punjab&amp;amp; sarhad to balochistan!!!!!! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#0000ff"&gt;"Itihaas", "Prasashann", "Sarkaar"??? WHAT THE FUDGE???????? lolzzzzzzzzzzz we pakistanis dont even know what these words mean ahhahaha this is HINDI DUDEEEEEEEEEEEE he is INDIAN &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, there is this comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;im indian muslim i﻿ know accent of indian muslim better than a paki. he is pathan from pakistani NWF province.. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Definitely not from the deccan…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;Check out the accent when he says hamare or udhar or how he pronounces the word "twenty five" or "ye bateen". The guy probably knows english but is non urban. sounds like a panjabi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;He uses sanskrit words like like balak and Pathshala in a highly contrived way an indian especially from the deccan would never bother to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;In India as well as in Pakistan both Z and J are used in spoken Urdu this means nothing. Incidentally he does both. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at Language Log, in a &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=876#comment-13627"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on the earlier post, Akshay wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;… spoken Urdu in Hyderabad is quite different from spoken Urdu in Pakistan; it&amp;#39;s very very easy for a native speaker to make out the difference. Not just pronounciation, but also idioms, expressions and most importantly slang; I&amp;#39;m no expert on dialects, and quite evidently, I may be emotionally-biased, but to my ear, there&amp;#39;s no way those recorded statements from terrorists holed up in the Oberoi can be Hyderabadi. There&amp;#39;s a certain sing-a-long quality to the dialect that was missing; it definitely sounded more Punjabi-Pakistani than anything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Karan &lt;a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=876#comment-13708"&gt;added this comment&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000"&gt;I can second what Akshay says about the accent of the voice in the recorded statement to NewsX being Pakistani-Punjabi and not Indian-Hyderabadi (I'm from the Indian Punjab), although I'm not sure that the voice has been confirmed as being of one of the terrorists during the attack. There was a line or two that the person on the phone addressed to someone in the background that was entirely in Punjabi, roughly translated: "What are our demands?"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm inclined to believe Yogi Sikand, Akshay and Karan. However, for those of us who are interested in the linguistic details but are ignorant of Hindi/Urdu sociolinguistics, it would be nice to to see a transcript and a more detailed and systematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Liberman</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Language Log</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228545000230"><id gr:original-id="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=616">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/2f77e656c746c311</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Me Thinking So You Don't Have To"/><title type="html">Ironic Band Breakups</title><published>2008-12-06T04:56:31Z</published><updated>2008-12-06T04:56:31Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://mattmaroon.com/?p=616" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://mattmaroon.com/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;There may be something, somewhere in this incomprehensibly wide universe cooler than &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E8WQUY?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=themaroon-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001E8WQUY"&gt;Rock Band 2&lt;/a&gt;, but if so I’ve never seen it. Harmonix did just an incredible job on that one. If I didn’t have so much damn work to do I’d be playing that game until I was blind, deaf, and so weak in the fingers that I couldn’t even sign my name.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing about these Guitar Hero type games that anyone will tell you is they tend to change your musical preferences a bit. Most notably, you start to appreciate or even like some songs you previously despised. For instance, I used to change the channel the instant I heard 3 notes of any song by Kansas, but now on the off chance I stumble across &lt;em&gt;Carry On Wayward Son &lt;/em&gt;I’ll turn it up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a rock fan it’s inevitable that some of the songs on any one game you already loved, some you maybe didn’t but will grow to, and some you can tolerate. But on every version there are one or two that are just so awful that having to play them a few times makes you want to pour Quickrete into your ear canal just to be sure you’ll never have to suffer through that again. In previous discs it was usually something by Slipknot, but this time it’s &lt;em&gt;We Got the Beat&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most tragedies, I was curious how The Go Go’s happened. It’s good to learn about that sort of stuff, lest history repeat itself. At some point in the future it’s not inconceivable that I will have a daughter, and if, by chance, she starts down a treacherous path of life choices that, if left unchecked, could lead to her forming a new wave band, at least now my few minutes of reading Wikipedia will enable me to recognize it and seek professional help before it’s too late.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I realize new wave is no laughing matter (I rank it right behind AIDS and terrorism) I did find one thing was pretty funny. Apparently the lead singer, Belinda Carlisle, was briefly a member of The Germs but she had to leave because she got sick. Oh, the irony. That’s like having to leave AC/DC because you got electrocuted. Or quitting Journey because you felt like travelling. Or Bad Religion because you joined the Church of Scientology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on with this all day, but I’ve got songs to unlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="width:444px"&gt;&lt;a title="A&amp;#39;s favorite: The Buzzed Aldrin by A Kovacs, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arealgirl/2687818644/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3107/2687818644_aa4a3a4c1b.jpg" alt="A&amp;#39;s favorite: The Buzzed Aldrin" width="434" height="325"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.real.girl +a Buzzed Aldrin + patented Skepchick eye roll + Surlyramics necklace= WIN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, it’s not just me who’ll be shining up these events, as I’ve confirmed some pretty cool guests too. (Although, unlike Rebecca, I’m not adding learnin’ to my drinkin’.   There will be no presentations at either of these events, outside of the odd bar trick, or maybe some a cappella karaoke.  There will, however, be Skepchick and Skepdude Calendars for sale.)  Northside &amp;amp; Southside details are after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Northside:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking Skepchickally San Francisco, Wednesday, December 10th, 2008. 7:00pm. &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/500-club-san-francisco"&gt;The 500 Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skepchick reader &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/psdbny"&gt;psdbny&lt;/a&gt; recommended The 500 Club, and as she works there, she’s making sure they’ll have ingredients on hand to make Buzzed Aldrins and Pangalactic Garbleblasters!  Rawk! (First round of Buzzed Aldrins are on me!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have two special guests I’m thrilled about, and if you’re here at Skepchick, I’m sure you will be too:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kirstensanford.com"&gt;Dr. Kirsten Sanford&lt;/a&gt; will be joining us.  She’s the exquisitely talented host of the &lt;a href="http://www.twis.org/"&gt;This Week in Science&lt;/a&gt; podcast, as well as &lt;a href="http://www.kirstensanford.com/the-science-word/"&gt;The Science Word&lt;/a&gt;, a vidcast I love, love, love.  I’ve mentioned before that I’m a podcast junkie, right?  TWIS is on my DO NOT MISS list, and if you love SGU, you’ll love TWIS too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yau-Man_Chan"&gt;Yau-Man Chan&lt;/a&gt; will also be there.  I met Yau-Man working on the &lt;a href="http://www.skeptologists.com/"&gt;Skeptologists&lt;/a&gt; pilot, but if you’re a Survivor fan, you’ll know him from Survivor: Fiji, and Survivor: Micronesia – Fans vs. Favorites.  When he’s not outsmarting competitors on network TV by being rational, funny and super cool, he’s the CTO of Berkeley’s College of Chemistry.  &lt;/p&gt;

Wilson Observatory" width="173" height="130"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got feelers out to a few more skeptical friends in the Bay Area, which would only add to the kick-ass evening.  You don’t want to miss it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;Southside: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking Skepchickally, San Diego, Thursday, December 11, 2008.  7:00pm. &lt;a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fleetwood-san-diego#hrid:KfAAxIL3OnAImMy0i2Q8Yg/query:bar%20good%20for%20groups"&gt;The Fleetwood. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one’s all &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/malidragon"&gt;malidragon&lt;/a&gt;’s fault.  She lives near San Fran, but is coming to San Diego on Wednesday. So, because she asked, we’re Drinking Skepchickally while she’s here.  I live here, so to spice things up for the local crew who are probably already tired of me, we’re adding more Skepchick!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Carr2d2&amp;#39;s $2.00 Tip by A Kovacs, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arealgirl/2814205282/"&gt;&lt;img title="Carr2d2 gives a.real.girl a $2.00 bill tip.

&lt;p&gt;That’s right kids, &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?author=1262"&gt;Carr2d2&lt;/a&gt; is coming in from Minnesota!  I’m so damned excited.  Oh, and also?  &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4454#comment-40750"&gt;Tim3P0&lt;/a&gt; is joining her.  That’s right bee-yotches, The Droids will be in the house!  So San Diegans?  Angelenos?  Just don’t miss this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here too, I’ve got feelers out to a few more local skeptical friends, which would again, add more kick-ass to the evening.  I’ll keep you posted. As I’ve mentioned before, anyone who shows up in San Diego that was with us in San Fran drinks on me until they spill a drink on me.  Then you’re cut off due to the party foul.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>a.real.girl</name></author><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://skepchick.org/blog/?feed=rss2</id><title type="html">Skepchick</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://skepchick.org" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:is-read-state-locked="true" gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1228511567402"><id gr:original-id="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/squidmas_carols.php">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/912bb098943b5643</id><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/reading-list" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="reading-list"/><category term="user/15483461753948633089/state/com.google/read" scheme="http://www.google.com/reader/" label="read"/><category term="Weirdness"/><title type="html">Squidmas carols!</title><published>2008-12-05T21:08:28Z</published><updated>2008-12-05T21:08:28Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/scienceblogs/pharyngula/~3/476052097/squidmas_carols.php" type="text/html"/><link rel="canonical" href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/12/squidmas_carols.php"/><summary xml:base="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/" type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is so sweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed the Friend Feed widget on the sidebar.  I've added this as a sort of "mini-blog", where we can post brief links or stories.  I'd say it's just out of beta at this point, but it seems to be working out.  I'll probably post links and carnivals there from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also have noticed the &lt;a href="https://www.hon.ch/HONcode/Conduct.html?HONConduct265516"&gt;HONcode badge&lt;/a&gt; on the left sidebar.  We receive our HONcode certification several weeks ago.  We do our best to comply with the HONcode principles, which you can read about on their website.  Basically, HON is an international organization to help ensure quality of  online medical resources.  They do not screen for content as such, but ask sites to adhere to certain principles, and they are generally pretty assertive about the certification process (it's unclear how good they are about de-certifiying sites that violate the principles).&lt;/p&gt;

Let me attempt to answer it.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first place, what is the evidence against the existence of fairies or unicorns? If by looking and not seeing any isn’t considered evidence against their existence, then I don’t know what is required here. Let Dr. Craig first provide evidence against the existence of fairies or unicorns and I’ll provide evidence against the existence of God. Someone cannot provide evidence against the existence of an non-entity, since if it doesn't exist then it cannot leave any traces of its non-existence for us to examine. Think about this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I do happen to think there is evidence against the existence of the Christian God, since that God depends upon the revelation found within the pages of the canonized writings in the Bible. There is the empirical evidence of intense undeserved suffering in the world which cannot be explained by a perfectly good omnipotent creator; there is archaeological evidence against the Biblical stories of the world-wide flood, the Exodus and the conquest stories in the Bible; there is geological evidence showing the earth has existed for 5 billion years; there is biological evidence showing one species evolved into the next one which disconfirms there was ever a time when there was no death in the Garden of Eden; there is psychological evidence that no wrathful God could exist given the fact that we believe and behave as we do based upon early childhood experiences; there is neurological evidence in that strokes and seizes disconfirm the notion of a soul; there is historical evidence against the believability of the virgin birth story, Satan, hell and the bodily resurrection of Jesus from the dead too. Christians will try to dispute this evidence and/or try to show it doesn't amount to much. I vehemently disagree, but it is evidence, plenty of it. And there is more I haven't mentioned. The evidence is against the God we find in the Bible, period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It’s a sobering plot, to be sure. Interestingly, they included the (inflation-adjusted) cost of both the Apollo missions and the running total of NASA’s budget since its inception in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number they listed for that is 850 billion dollars. That’s a lot of money too, though only about 1/5 of the bailout… and that’s for &lt;em&gt;50 years of space exploration&lt;/em&gt;, one of the costliest endeavors ever undertaken by man. Think of everything NASA has done: gone to the moon, launched countless weather satellites, built a space station (more than one, really), orbited communications satellites, visited every planet in the solar system (Pluto soon, too), visited a handful of asteroids and comets… and don’t forget Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, Fermi, Swift, Ibex, JWST, Kepler, Copernicus, the OAOs, IRAS, SWAS, SOHO, and many, many more. It’s hard to say how much Hubble cost, but I would guess it’s near 7 or 8 billion bucks by now. That’s only 1% of NASA’s lifetime budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And mind you, &lt;em&gt;NASA gets less than 1% of the national budget today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to make of this? Well, I’m not precisely sure, except to point out that our grandest triumphs, in dollars, only cost us a fraction of our mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;

Via Media Matters comes an impressive
list of stories in the media about the automobile companies financial problems, where they cite labor costs as a major issue. So far, so good. But in virtually every
story about this, you'll find a statement along the lines of: "union workers make $71 an hour in wages plus benefits".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In many cases, they even go so far as to specifically compare that figure &lt;em&gt;as wages&lt;/em&gt; to other companies. For example, this quote, from a conservative
talking head:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When you're paying $73.73 an hour to those people with salary and benefits and your competition is paying $48 to its workers, you're going to get your butt kicked in the marketplace unfortunately."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Here's the problem with that. The roughly $70/hour figure is a statement of &lt;em&gt;labor costs&lt;/em&gt;, not wages. What's the difference?&lt;/p&gt;

What mob veto?  The gay mob veto!  The gays are engaging in "violence and intimidation" against the Mormons because of their support for &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2008/11/looks_like_the_samesex_marriag.php"&gt;Proposition 8&lt;/a&gt; (California's gay marriage ban.)&lt;/p&gt;

Most of this junk is very small, like grains of sand or smaller. As the Earth rams this stream, the flotsam burns up in our atmosphere, and we get a meteor shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/11/18/leonids-tonight-will-the-lion-roar-once-again/"&gt;the Leonid meteor shower&lt;/a&gt;, because the geometry of the event makes it look like the meteors are coming from the region of the sky in the constellation of Leo. It’s usually not a great shower, producing a couple of dozen meteors per hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But every now and again, the Leonids undergo a huge burst, a tremendous increase in the number of meteors. The biggest surges happened in 1833, 1866, 1966 and 1999… so with a 33 year period, but with some gaps. Basically, the comet sometimes sheds large numbers or particles, which then orbit the Sun on roughly the same path as the parent comet. So every 33 years — the same period as the comet itself — the clumps of particles are in the part of their orbit where we can smack them. They aren’t always in exactly the same spot, so sometimes we miss them. Hence the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact times and number of meteors for these surges are hard to know. But techniques have been getting better, and by studying the Leonids from a few weeks, ago, &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/04dec_leonids2009.htm?list27315"&gt;astronomers are predicting a minor storm&lt;/a&gt; next year in November 2009. According to their calculations, in 2009 we’ll pass through the debris stream shed by the comet in the year 1466. Sure, that was over 500 years ago, but in space things sometimes evolve slowly, and the dust/ice particles are still clumped up together. So now, even half a millennium later, we can still see a pretty good show as we plow through them. In 2009 we might see as many as 500 meteors per hour, or one every 7 or 8 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Leonids. The comet orbits the Sun in the opposite direction the Earth does, so we ram these guys head-on. That means they are moving much faster than regular meteors, which in turn means they really zip across the sky and burn up much brighter (the energy of motion depends on the velocity squared, so they pack a punch). But the weather! I watched them in Virginia in 1999, and it was killer cold out. In California it was always foggy, though one year we had a hole in the fog directly overhead, so my daughter and I did get to see a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that the showers are best after local midnight, so we’re talking 2:00 a.m. or so. That’s tough, even on this amateur naked-eye astronomer. Making it worse, the storm next year favors China, and not the U.S., so staying up late may not pay off so well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I imagine I’ll take that chance. Meteor showers are a lot of fun, and it’s a chance for me and The Little Astronomer to lie out under the stars and talk. That’s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the Comment o’ the Week, I’ll mention a few events coming up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here in &lt;strong&gt;Boston&lt;/strong&gt;, Anonymous will hold a candlelight vigil in front of the Church of Scientology to remember the death of &lt;a href="http://www.lisamcpherson.org/"&gt;Lisa McPherson&lt;/a&gt;, a woman who died while under the care of the “Church.” &lt;a href="http://non.violentuprising.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2"&gt;More info on the non.violent forums&lt;/a&gt;. (Aside: speaking of Anon, if you’d like to help in their ongoing campaign to educate the public about the CoS, you may consider donating to support the site WhyWeProtest.net, which costs volunteers about $870/month to operate. &lt;a href="http://forums.whyweprotest.net/205-site-news-announcements/announcements/wwp-donations-drive/"&gt;More info here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in the &lt;strong&gt;Boston area&lt;/strong&gt;, tomorrow I’ll be attending the Harvard’s Humanist of the Year award, given this year to Dan McGowan of &lt;a href="http://parentingbeyondbelief.com/seminars/sem_boston"&gt;parentingbeyondbelief.com&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free and happening in the Fong Auditorium of Boylston Hall in Harvard Yard, and there’s a seminar afterward for a fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next week (Saturday, December 13), I’m taking the &lt;strong&gt;Boston Skeptics&lt;/strong&gt; on a trip to the Museum of Science, followed by Skeptics in the Pub! &lt;a href="http://bostonskeptics.com/?p=44"&gt;Info is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also on the 13th, Maria will be at Atlanta Skeptics in the Pub! &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1062/"&gt;See the Events Calendar for the details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also next week, A will be hosting Drinking Skepchickally in &lt;strong&gt;San Francisco&lt;/strong&gt; on the 10th, and with Carr2D2 in &lt;strong&gt;San Diego&lt;/strong&gt; on the 11th! &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1062/"&gt;See the Events Calendar for the details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See the same calendar for more events around the world! Okay, mostly in North America and the UK. Those of you in other places are &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?page_id=1227/"&gt;encouraged to submit your event here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, on to the COTW! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had thousands of comments posted this week, but one among them received the rare triple-nomination. Sam’s call for readers to vent their every frustration was sure to get some entertaining rants, and &lt;a href="http://skepchick.org/blog/?p=4501#comment-41514"&gt;Oakes’ comedic use of over-the-top violence&lt;/a&gt; certainly delivered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oakes&lt;img style="border:medium none;float:left;margin-right:10px;display:inline" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44a8437e26d0de41862359846a742837?rating=X&amp;amp;default=http://use.perl.org/images/pix.gif" alt="No Gravatar" width="80" height="80"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;// Dec 4, 2008 at 4:19 pm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this seems somewhat petty, what with all the horrible shit going on in the world, but the thing that annoys me most consistently are commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t watch a lot of TV, but the few shows I do watch are constantly ruined by insipid, innane, intellectually-stunting pitches. I usually have a book handy, so the second “Mythbusters” cuts to a commercial, I can mute the TV and read for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sometimes the filth breaks through the filter…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a violent man, but I swear on the perpetually-pissed soul of Buford Pusser that, if I ever see that “Can you hear me now?” jackass from the Verizon commercials, I will chop him in the throat with no warning. And I will feel good about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that “band” from the Free Credit Report.com commericals? I would kidnap them, chain them up in an abandoned house in the country, and violate every single Geneva convention. Twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, Oakes. Never have I seen such an adorable armadillo (I think that’s your avatar?) lash out with such well-aimed fury. For your comment, you get one free month of Skepchick Anger Management Classes® at the Learning Annex, where you’ll learn skills like calmly explaining the basics of evolutionary theory to a creationist, and quietly sitting in the presence of strangers reading horoscopes aloud.
